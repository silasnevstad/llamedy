Some of the animals I see, like I was in the airport the other day, right. I'm sitting there waiting for my flight. Just hating my life and watching this lady. She's eating Egg McMuffins, like plural, it's just threw three of them right down her throat like a pelican. Right down her gullet. Whenh she was done she wiped her face with the bag, WITH THE BAG. Not even like a gentlemen *dabs at face* *ghoulish scream*. Like she just got a straight razor shave, like an absolute animal. I saw this other dude he was so out of shape. He was like trying to itch his back and he couldn't reach it. So he walked up to a support pole that was holding up an entire floor of the airport and just walks up and he just starts like rubbing up against it. Like a grizzly bear just sitting there, like a fucking animal. Dude I am so pro swine flu it's it's like ridiculous. I want it, we need a plague I'm telling you we need a plague. It's got to happen. Don't be afraid it's only good it's only gonna kill the weak. Put on a sweater, take some vitamins you better be fine. You gotta let Mother Nature do her thing man, she keeps trying to help us out and we won't let her do it. Keeps trying to thin the heard, and every single time were like 'you've gotta get your vaccinations'! Why Why?! So egg mcmuffin lady can breed with the backfat, you know? It's gotta happen, you gotta let it do it. Seriously plague it's like nature's forest fire, you know, just let it burn out all the dead wood. I swear to God we're the only were the only species that saves the weak. We really are, you know? Lions don't do that shit. Lion gets a little thorn in his paw and everybody, 'so lets have an intervention, how are you feeling is everything all right? Do you need some penecilin?'. Like that's why there's no lion traffic on the Serengeti! A bunch of lions just standing there in gridlock like 'what the fuck is going on up there, go just fucking go!', You get up there there's some hyena licking his balls, like so that was the big holdup, so you've never seen that before? By all means slow down and look at it! \n",

            "So I got a girlfriend man. I watch a lot of TV with her, you know? I just annoy the hell out of her. She loves watching The Oprah Winfrey Show and I love like watching her watch The Oprah Winfrey Show, and I wait for Oprah's say something stupid in the second she does I just take it out on my girl because I'm an asshole. No we're watching it the other day you know Oprah's on there she's interviewing some clam, you know. Yeah she's giving her this big ridiculous intro like she's done this she's done that she's done this and she does the most difficult job on the planet she's a mother. It goes on and immediately I just look at my girlfriend, \"like really being a mother is the most difficult job on the planet oh yeah all those mothers who die every year for Black Lung from inhaling all that coal dust\". The women are just constantly patting themselves on the back about how difficult their lives are and no one corrects them because they want to fuck em. It's what it is. So theres just this tornado of like misinformation, \"I have the most difficult job on the planet\". What would you rather be doing drilling to the center of the earth shaking hands with the devil every time there's a rumble in the ground you wait for the whole thing to collapse down on top? So they can write that folk song about you. Or would you rather be up in the sunshine running around with a couple of toddlers that you can send to bed anytime you want on some sort of trumped up charges. Right cuz you want to have a drink and watch The Price is Right. I couldn't believe it. \"It's the most difficult job on the planet\". I thought roofing in the middle of July is a redhead, I thought that was difficult. But these mothers are bending over at the waist putting DVDs into DVD players. I dont know how they do it! Dude any job that you can do in your pajamas it's not a difficult job. Your 35 years old playing hide-and-go-seek, your living the dream. No time card no taxes you're off the fucking grid. Making popsicle stick houses, I mean. \"It's an us difficult job on the planet\", Oprah's not even a mother fucking mother how could she know. Granted neither am I, but I, you know, I think it balances itself.\n",

            "Oh I'm so old. I really am. I really realized that about myself. Maybe that's one thing about getting old you just realize how full of shit you are. You know. People ask you questions you just start answering them. Get to that point you're just watching the shit coming out of your mouth while people are listening taking notes. Yeah I flunked everything in high school why would you listen to me. You know I had lunch with this girl the other day. Right right in the middle of lunch she looked across the table for me and she goes, \"this is gonna seem oddly racist\". And I was like \"alright this is gonna be awesome\", 41 years old never heard a conversation started this way lets have it baby. Let's see what you got. She just like \"um there are a lot of Asians in this restaurant\". Look that's not racist. Thats an observation. There are a lot of Asians in this restaurant. However if you were to say \"what the fuck are all these fucking Asians doing this goddamn restaurant\". Now that, that would seem oddly racist but you still haven't said anything bad about Asians but you definitely seem to have a problem with them being in the restaurant. Which is odd because I've never heard any bad stereotypes about Asians in restaurants. You know what I mean? Like dude they come in there taking up all the tables, you know? Just beat all Asians. What do you hear, all y'all here is about their driving, but even that ones bull shit. It's not that they suck there's just no happy medium, you know? See the Tokyo Drift, 90 miles an hour, driving sideways parallel parking and breakdancing into the club. Right, like Jesus Christ is that guy from the future. How does one man possess all of that talent. Or they just stop in the middle of a intersection. They don't even get mad, they don't even get mad. I know I suck. it's boring it's almost like it's so simple I just start daydreaming and yeah... I don't know.\n",

            "I find a lot of that a lot of that racial stuff like fascinating, you know? Like the different rules of like how who gets in trouble who doesn't. Like I've noticed black people have the genius to put the curse word after they say the race of the person. Where white dudes we always put it in front. And if we would just make that little adjustment we could save so many careers. So many jobs could be saved in the white community if we would just put it after. You never noticed that in conversation hear a black guy be like \"man I was standing there this Asian mother-fucker came in, he starts talking about...\". You don't even hear it! Your just sitting here like, what did this Asian mother-fucker do. I would love to hear the rest of this story, right? Dude I would tell the exact same story right \"I'm standing there this fucking asian comes in\". Everybody is like \"woah, woah, hey easy, easy jesus dude. What year is it?\" Its like, dude, I just said what he said he's suggesting he's hooking up with people's mothers! I'm not even doing that I got it out of the way. I got it out of the way. Its just how I talk a fucking guy came in he's fucking Asian. Dude he wearing sandals, Jesus Christ. Oh my god sandals, middle of December, yeah those people. Man my feet don't get cold. No there's always that one guy with a big ski Parker and shorts. Ah my leg, my legs don't get cold. Thats like his only hope of hooking up with somebody, like maye thats interesting to mate with. That'll make a strong baby, his legs don't get cold. I don't know what it is. Plenty of blood for the organs *rubs stomach*. That had nothing to do with you they had to do with me being on the road for four months.\n",

Ah you got enough weirdos here, you know, it's enough mom-and-pop sort of independent run stores. That's a big thing with me like when I go on the road, like I can't, you know I can't do these these chains anymore. You know how know depressing it is to go to a town and see like another just horde of fat people stumbling out of a cheesecake factory. You know oh their horrific, just pressing their face up against the glass ways. Inventing ways to get extra fat, you know. You know I hate about these these these corporate chains you could go in there you're paying for a business, and they make you do like half the job though. I don't get it. Like I walk in and let me get a turkey sandwich lettuce tomato on rye with mayonnaise. The guy behind the counters like 'turkey sandwich lettuce tomato on rye'. 'Eh yea and mayonnaise'. 'Oh the mayonnaise it's a, its right over there. Really? Why don't you ugh go over there and put it on my sandwhich. Get it? Im on this side of the register, guy who orders the sandwich *points to himself*, guy who makes the sandwich *points over the counter*. Get it? Im sorry they fired the mayonnaise guy but I'm not doing it. I just gave you 100 percent of the money to make 100 percent of the sandwich. This isn't like a relay race you make half the sandwich, then you hand it off to me, I run over I throw a pickle on it, frisbee it over my mom she sticks an olive with the toothpick in it. Do you recognize me? Its beause I don't fucking work here. Make the sandwich! Im out, im out, I gave you money. I'm out, it's over, thats the end of my part. No I asked this guy for a drink, he gave me a cup, I finally go you know let me just get this whole thing to go. And the guys like, 'right the to-go lids, they're right over there, you just snap the lid on top'. I just wanted to grab this guy by his throat and be like 'where is he, where is he?!' 'Where is who?' 'The guy making me do all this extra shit. And just choke my way up that corporate ladder till I get to that Eyes Wide Shut party and everybody's sitting there getting blown. Ill kick the door open, the second they see my angry face and that lid I won't have to explain myself. Just put it on somebody's face and just start smashing. How bigs yacht gotta be! Now that's the thing like never enough. It's never enough with those guys.\n",

'Cuz I did that joke when I was down in the BIBLE BELT, and I was down south, and this girl took me really seriously. She came up to me at the end of the show, she's like, \"You're not really thinking about doing something like that, are you?\" I was like, \"No, just joking, just joking.\" She goes, \"Good, 'cuz you know you can't go to heaven if you do stuff like that.\" I was just like, \"Yeah, you know, I don't give a shit.\" It's not that I don't... I just like freaking out people that are that religious that have a whole little checklist of \"if you do this, you go here, if you do that...\" How do you know that? You don't know that. Shut up. I think it's very normal thought to think about killing yourself, you know? I do. You know, it's weird. Anytime I think about killing myself, it's never over anything big. It's always little things. Little things make me want to take myself out. It's bizarre. Like, if my girlfriend broke up with me, I'm not gonna lie to you, I would be devastated. Devastated. Be laying on the ground crying in the fetal position for like three days. You know, about the fourth day, you know, I might rub one out. You know, I gotta do... Join the gym, lie to myself that I'm gonna get the six-pack back. I know what I gotta do, right? But little things... I thought about killing myself like a year ago on Thanksgiving. You know why? It was 'cuz I said I was gonna make a pie. That little statement made me think about taking myself out. This is... Look, this is basically the deal, right? My girlfriend's an angel. She absolutely loves the holidays. So it's like two weeks before Thanksgiving, so she's all excited. She's like, \"Oh my God, Thanksgiving is coming up!\" I'm trying to watch the game. \"Thanksgiving! What are you gonna do for Thanksgiving?\" Right? I started freaking out like I didn't think I had to do anything for Thanksgiving, you know? I just thought I had to, you know, not get drunk and be belligerent around your friends. I thought I was fine. She's like, \"No, I'm gonna make a turkey, I'm gonna make stuffing. What are you gonna do?\" So I panicked. I'm like, \"I'll make a pie! Make a pie!\" I was just trying to make it go away. Never do that. You disagree with them, thinking to make them leave. Like, \"Yeah, awesome, what you said!\" No, but it totally worked. It totally worked, but she walked away completely excited. She was like, \"No way! No way!\" All excited. And I totally forgot about it, right? Two weeks later, Thanksgiving comes up, right? She just wakes up, she's like, \"Oh my God, Thanksgiving! Hey, thank you! You're gonna make that pie, right? You said you're gonna make a pie!\" It's like, I gotta make the pie? I gotta go to the grocery store? I got to buy some flour? Then I just started thinking, \"Man, why don't we just slam my head right through this plate glass window and just bleed out right down the side of the house?\" No, I wouldn't have to... So it's not even like I'm suicidal. It's more like I'm... like, lazy. I mean, like, whenever I know the next four hours of my life is gonna suck, like I think about... \"God, I gotta pay my taxes. It's a long line at the bank, and that bus is coming by. What if I just dove head first, right? A little stumble, backflip...\" Anybody else ever think of like that?\n",

            "So anyway, so I decided not to go home for the holidays. It's what I'm really trying to tell you here. No, I did. I kind of came to the epiphany. I'm like, \"Man, I'm 41 years old. My dad had five kids by the time he's my age. I got to get on with my life here.\" So I was like, on... You know what? I'm not... not working Thanksgiving, I'm not working Christmas, I'm not working New Year's. It was like the middle of October. I was like, \"Wait a minute, what about Halloween?\" And my brain was like, \"You know what? Fuck this. I'm getting a pumpkin.\" Thank you. That's how angry my brain is. It can't be just like, \"You know what? Hey, let's get a pumpkin.\" Its gotta be like... \"Fuck this! Let's get a pumpkin\" That's when I started thinking. Carving that... \"Oh man, I'll give candy to the kids. I'm meeting them at the door. 'Hey, what are you supposed to be, huh? Oh yeah, full-sized Snickers. Who does AC/DC? Pumpkin? You haven't seen that before, have you? Right, you tell all your friends when you see that. What are you, bringing to one side? That's heavy. Here's another candy bar. You like dumbbell? Walk, break down the stairs.'\" This is how much of a maniac I am. You know, this is all true. It took me four trips to go to the supermarket to finally be able to buy this goddamn pumpkin because every time I would walk in there to get it, I'd be thinking all these happy thoughts. This is a great thing. I'm embracing the holidays. It's gonna bring me and my girlfriend together. It's a very loving thing to do. When I reach out and grab it, and all I'd hear in the back of my head is, \"What are you, a fag?\" I had to turn around and walk out. All right, let me explain that joke to functional people in the crowd. Let me explain this, all right? This is how it works with guys. Anytime you do anything remotely sensitive, heartwarming, anything that's gonna make you more of a loving, caring individual, immediately all your guy friends suggest that maybe, just maybe, you want to suck a dick. Oh, it's brutal. Even if you do something smart, right? Like it's raining out, \"He's got an umbrella what a fag! Oh my god, what are you afraid of the water. Put your shoulders up you fucking homo! Jesus Christ, would you pull that thing out of your ass?\" Oh, it's brutal. Oh, it doesn't even have to make sense. \"You carved the pumpkin? What are you gonna do next, carve some guy's ass with your cock? What, are you gonna blow a scarecrow? Get away from me with your gay little pumpkin, odds bro.\" Dude, what do you a fag is the reason why guys drop at 55 out of nowhere. It's literally from five decades, it's just suppressing the urge to like... hug a puppy, admit a baby's cute, say you want a cookie. You just gotta keep pushing it down like, \"fuck man I'm not sucking dick, I'm not sucking dick!\" One day, one day you're in a Denny's, and if you get to put bananas in your pancakes, you just have like an aneurysm and your head slams off that sticky table. And the last thing you hear before it all goes black is your friends go \"he got bananas in his pancakes, what a fag! Oh my god it wasn't sweet enough with the syrup. You fairy! It's a horrible, horrible way to live your life. You can't like... You're just dying every day. Does every dumb thing that you can do as a guy, any stupid thing that's gonna shorten your life, makes you more of a man. Zero degrees out, you know, have a coat on. \"Dude, you're cold?\" Can't admit it. \"No, I'm not cold. I'm just thinking of something I really agree with.\"\n",

            "Now, trying to let go of this ball of hate in my chest, that's why I don't have any kids. I thought... I think it's irresponsible to be a complete maniac, not work on yourself, and then just have a kid and then just start downloading all your fucked up thoughts onto that little kid's hard drive, you know? Just send them off to school with your little... your little manifestos. They're freaking out other kids. It's cool, \"2+2, Timmy, what did you get\". \"Dad keeps cash in the walls because he doesn't trust banks.\" Yea! No, it's embarrassing to know this little about yourself at my age, man. I got to get beyond like... You know, I finally ended up getting that pumpkin. You know, I did. I actually had to bring my girlfriend down to the supermarket, and I had to walk her by the pumpkins because I knew the second I did it, she was gonna freak out. And she did. Second she saw, Jesus, like, \"Oh my God, a pumpkin! Halloween's coming up! We should get it!\" Starts doing like this little pumpkin dance. And I had this unbelievable urge just to take her head and just mush it right through the pumpkins and really hold it there for a second. Like, feel the panic in the back of her head as the air bubbles became like less and less frequent. She sat there contemplating, \"Is this how it is going to end, pumpkin seeds up my nose? I always envisioned being surrounded by loved ones, looking back on achievements. It's so orange!\" God, I resented her. Resented the fact she gets to be a fag. She does. She gets to see pumpkin, right? Sees a little puppy, cries in sad movies. I gotta hold on to all of that, slowly dying inside. Go out to go see a sad movie, comes to the sad part. What do I do? She's crying. I got to think of some... \"I what if somebody'd kick Sean Penn in the balls right now.\" I would start laughing. Then they get mad at out, \"how could you laugh at a time like this!. I'm not fucking allowed. Thank you, sir. I like that you turned this into a town meeting. This guy down there, right? \"It's exactly it. I always wanted to cry when I was watching Lifetime, but I was never allowed to!\"\n",

            "I just feel myself, I'm starting to change. Me, I'm a happier person and I... I think I'm ready, man. I want to have a kid. It's a big thing. I want to have a kid. But the only thing I'm worried about about that is I like little kids. I like them when they're little. I don't like when they get bigger and they start thinking like they know, you know? Like, I understand why parents hit their kids. I get it. You know, I'm not saying take your day out on them, but definitely, you know, they get a little lippy, you know, throw out a jab. Set the tone. Now, when they start thinking they know stuff... But you know, my buddy's got a kid. His kid is at that age, right? They invite me over, you know, come to dinner the other day because I'm like at that age. I'm like that weirdo guy they feel... they feel sad for. So they gotta invite me over. \"Yeah, I really have a pathetic existence. It's my life.\" So I'm sitting, I'm trying to be social with the kid, you know? He's really into space, so I'm like, \"Hey, look, the sky's around and the stars are out.\" The kid's like, \"Actually, that's not a star. That... what is... Jupiter. Jupiter is the fifth planet.\" Wow, like you're impressed. \"Wow, really? Is it? Is it?\" They won't shut up. They just keep going on. \"It's got 17 moons.\" And I gotta sit there acting impressed 'cuz I'm just waiting for another adult to come by and just scoop the kid up and just rescue me. Gotta sit here and act like I'm amazed with this. I saw a stripper quit on stage two months ago. What do you think you're gonna tell me that's gonna blow my mind? So the kid just kept going on and on. It's good, it's good... I couldn't take it anymore, so then I finally did. I just... I had poured a little water on him. He didn't know what to do it was great. He just froze up. He didn't have the social maturity to be like, \"Dude did you just pour water on me. How old are you what type of person does that?\" So I'm sitting there, I am laughing my ass off. I'm dying. I'm like, \"I cracked the code. I finally figured out what to do in this situation.\" And you know what this little bastard did? He went in the kitchen. He told on me. And my buddy's wife comes running out. She starts screaming at me like I'm 5 years old, which technically I am because I'm pouring water on, like, you know, six-year-olds. Right? \"You don't do that! We don't do that in this house! That is a no, no, no, no. We don't do that.\" That's when my temper came up. \"No, yeah, you know what? Fuck you fuck your kid, fuck Jupiter. I'm outta here. I don't need this right now.\" That... I didn't do it. I just sat down. I was like, \"Look, you poured water on our kid.\" Okay, send an honest moment myself. I, you know... tried to debate it in my head to try to make yourself right. \"Yeah, but dude, it's bottled water. Like, this kid doesn't get rained on? That acid rain? You actually... You're cleansing his brow.\"\n",

            "I'm gonna have the kid 'cuz I like when that little... It's just worth it, you know? I like toddlers, man. That's... that's the best age. They're hilarious, you know? They never have a shirt on, they already got a beer belly even though they never drank before. They're not even self-conscious. They don't try to suck it in. They just let it hang out over the diaper. Got like cereal in their hair. They're a mess. They just see people talk and they just come up, they just start telling a story. They don't have the decency to start at the beginning. They like start in the middle, then they jump back to the beginning, and then they tell the end. It's like a Tarantino movie. Like Travolta's walking by in the background. Heart attack. Like drooling all over himself. Then they make wife beaters for little two-year-olds. They should do it. Put a little Fisher-Price Harley-Davidson. I can't take it. They're adorable. No, but it's a scary time, dude. It's a scary time to raise a kid. That's the only thing I'm worried about. It's a really scary time, you know? I think... I think they're getting ready to like microchip all of us. I'm not even jumping, dude. If you see that new Duracell commercial with that woman can't find her kid in the park. So what kind of a fucked up way is that to sell batteries? It's a little hardcore, don't you think? But remember the old battery commercials? They show some guy in a rainstorm, right? Changing a tire, takes out a flashlight. All right, thank God. It turns on. I can see how I'm getting... That was it. Not as shown. This woman, she can't find her kid in the park. She's something like, \"Kevin! Kevin!\" Sitting there freaking out. Then she pulls out this device, and then all of a sudden Kevin comes running out of the woods. And then just like, \"Duracell batteries.\" Like, don't... The batteries... What was that thing she just took out? We didn't have an antenna. His sneakers weren't glowing. What the fuck is in Kevin that is connected to that? Don't just show me that like that's normal. That is some creepy New World Order... Evidently, it's a bracelet and they just put the microchip in there. But that's how they gotta do it. They're gonna scare the shit out of you that someone's gonna take your kid. \"That's just a bracelet.\" What if they take the bracelet off? \"Well, just glue it to the forehead.\" Yeah, but just sort of drill it in there. I'm telling you, whatever they're doing to dogs, they're gonna be doing to us in like ten years, right? They got those six microchips with their balls cut off. Telling you, they're gonna have us on TV waiting to get rescued like some accountent and look at all fucked up with the TV, right? That's what you're getting here in the future. That's gonna be the future. \"Did you hear about Eddie? God, they turned his chip off, man.\" \"Dude, the guy's fucked. He is fucked. He made one little joke about the government. Next thing you know, he had to buy a round. His head wouldn't go through. They kept scanning it. Nothing. He's outside screaming up at the satellite, dude. Dude is fucked. The dude is fucked\" \"They are gonna turn my chip off I was standing next to him. I don't even know that guy!\"\n",

            "Advertisement in that thing, I swear to God they hand-picked those dogs. The cutest little fuzzy... I just want big... those cute little innocent little Dr. Seuss-looking dogs. Where are the pit bulls? Where are the Rottweilers? Where are those maniacs you see lifting weights down at the shelter? They got the saddest looking dogs ever and she's whining over the top of them. Those dogs are looking all sad at the camera. \"My last owner wasn't a nice person.\" Those ridiculous bandages, it's like they're in Saving Private Ryan. That Three Stooges rabbit ear... \"I have a toothache.\" That shit on that dog, what happened? I love that one, it's all wrapped up like a mummy. It's like how they get hit by a cannonball during a Civil War Reenactment. Then a Tyrannosaurus... Bigger... My favorite one's that one-eyed pug. \"It's a great dog! Bring that over to the kids, I'm sure that won't freak them out at all.\" \"Mommy, did you get us a dog?\" Just let him sniff... Do not approach him from the right and... Gotta push for the right... Sticking around becomes an entirely different animal when you do that. Just know, so she was in the van. I wanted to get the Bulldog. That was my thing. I was like, \"I want to get the Bulldog.\" Then I started researching on the Bulldogs. They got all these health problems, man. From day one they can't even breathe. They come out in the world, it's like they've been working with asbestos their entire life. You know, some people, they can't even breathe. You gotta have them sleeping upright in a lazy boy, rubbing Vicks VapoRub on that chest. They got like sleep apnea. They die nine times every night. Why don't I just rescue a retired offensive lineman. So I didn't know what to do, so we were at a stalemate. So my girl did what most females do. They just figure, \"I know it's good for him. I know it's gonna make him happy. I'm gonna make a major decision without him and then he's gonna deal with it.\" Yeah, that's how I got a dog. I got a dog when I was on the road. I was on the road, I just had a message on my machine. It was just... and I just heard she's like, \"Um, okay, I did something. Kind of involves both of us, but I think you're gonna love it. Just give me a call. Okay, bye.\" Now does that sound like I just signed you up for a 12 to 15 year commitment? Doesn't sound like that, right? That sounds like, \"I bought a new outfit. I'm gonna drag you to some awful restaurant during a playoff game.\" Okay, that's what it felt like. So I'm ready for that argument. She tells me she went out, she got a dog. Now half of me isn't upset because you got a rescue dog. \"Yeah, we have it for a week and, you know, if you want to keep it, we can.\" So I'm going, \"Let me see it.\" So we started Skyping and she pans around. You know what she got? She got a pit bull. So he's been doing pull-ups its entire life. Tri-pods were still taped up. It's like shadow boxing P90X. Jesus Christ. If she said like, \"Now he's three,\" she said. \"No, she's adorable,\" and all this stuff. This is worst part: I wasn't getting home for three days, you know, and she's all wrapped up in this dog. You know, and if I don't get home for three days, what happens when I get home on Monday and you have to go to work? She goes, \"Well, I just figured I'd drive to work and you could just come home to the apartment and meet the dog that way.\" Look at you, out of your mind! I'm not coming home to that. That dog is bonding with you and thinks you guys lived there. I'm gonna come walking in, have my calf ripped off 'cuz I'm trying to show my name on the phone bills. So she do play... What you do, you take that hellhound, you put it in the goddamn car, drive it to work, park in the shade, do whatever you gotta do. I'm coming home to a safe house and then you drive home with the dog. Call me when you're a half mile away. I'll meet you and Cujo down in the driveway. We'll all walk in together. I will be in the front to show that I am the pack leader because I watched half an episode of the Dog Whisperer and I think that that's what you're... Fall again. So true, right? So I've been out in the drive when I see you. Dogs are beautiful dogs, literally like walking like a marine or some shit. Like it's sleeping into some... like, \"Okay, here we go.\" Turning my back on a lot of pit bulls and I don't even know that. Turns out they didn't get it at the shelter. They found it by the LA River. It lived by the LA River for two weeks and my girl's response to that was like, \"No, it's not scary.\" Why is it scary? Well, obviously it got enough protein so it wasn't eating berries out there. They was choking out coyotes, breaking the necks of squirrels. I don't know what it was doing but it definitely was... He brought a murderer into the house. We'll just rescue an alligator while you're at it, just to add to the excitement. So we get the dog in the damn house. That's exactly what I thought was gonna happen. Dog's sitting there looking at her, then it's looking at me, and they're looking at her like, \"Who the hell is the new guy?\" Right? \"You guys, is this guy paying the rent?\" I was getting no respect. So I was just like... I also write down which... I was like, \"I know what she's doing. I know what she's doing. She's bringing this dog home 'cuz she thinks I'm gonna fall for it and then... and then she will just have the dog.\" And it's just like... I love animals, okay? But I'm not gonna live with one that can fucking kill me. And I rescue a chihuahua so when it flips out 'cuz I grabbed a remote too quickly, I can flick it off the goddamn table or something, you know? Size... Oh my God. We got it for a week. We got it for a week and then we make a decision. So I just shut down emotionally. Fuck this dog. First two days I didn't give a shit. You know, dog sitting there looking at me and I was just like, \"Jesus Christ.\" Then on Wednesday, I don't know what happened. I started to like it a little bit. You know, I was watching TV. You know, I always talked to myself. I'm always home alone. I feel like a maniac. I finally had someone... You bounce my ideas off. It's kind of nice. Sit there on TV. \"You believe these goddamn banks? You're still a trillion dollars and they get a bonus and they get a bonus.\" Dog's there looking at me. \"No, don't... Shit. Damn it. I think I like this dog.\" Alone, you know, it's making me wanna work out. You know, asking a question, \"How do you get these muscles?\" Then by Thursday, you know, I'm getting out in the air. I'm walking the dog and I'm fine. God damn, I think I love this dog. I don't know if you ever walked a pit bull. You owe it to your life at some point in your life to walk a pit bull down the street. I'm telling you, it's the greatest experience ever. People just get the fuck out of the way. It's not... I mean, three, four blocks away they see me coming, they just immediately cross the street. Just tremendous. I don't know why black people complain about that. It's the greatest thing ever. Pit bulls are the shit. It's... it's like a gun you can pet. It's the only way to describe it. They make you want to P90X or something, just get in better shape. So then by Friday, I mean by Friday, the dog was literally messing up my relationship. My poor girl's sitting on the couch by herself. I'm sitting there spooning with the dog and the fourth... We get a leg going. Once we get a leg going, I don't... What happened? It's four days. I went from \"fuck this dog\" to \"Oh my God, this thing's gonna die someday. How am I emotionally gonna be able to deal with it?\" I love it. Absolutely. I carried it around like a baby. It was the greatest thing ever. You come home, it's shaking its tail. It's all exciting like, \"Dude, you're fucking awesome!\" It's like... You have no idea how much I need that, you know? Tremendous. And you can't appreciate how awesome a dog is as a kid. You could only do it as an adult. As a kid, there's like no frame of reference. It's like... you're a kid. Your whole life is awesome. It's awesome, right? Never think about being a kid. You had no money, you had no ID, no cell phone, no nothing, no keys to the house. You just ran outside into the woods. You weren't scared of nothing. I challenge you to do that as an adult. All your ID, all your credit cards, just run out on us. No phone. Turn the corner where you can't see your house and not have a full-on panic attack. Your whole life is awesome as a kid, right? You show up, no money, just get stuff. Grilled cheese, movie tickets, right? Why wouldn't a dog be awesome? Everything is awesome. It's not till you're an adult that you appreciate it, right? Your dreams start dying. Somebody cheats on you, right? Bankers fuck up your 401k. Get out. Then you come home, that dog's still canary. You're like, \"Dude, you're awesome.\" It's like, \"No, dude, you...\" It's unreal. It's unreal. My poor girl, she's sitting on... Jesus Christ. She loved the dog more than he loved me. It's like, \"Well sweetie, you know, at the back door shaking your ass every time I come home, it's really a tough... No matter what time, 4:00 in the morning, drunk...\" So anyway, so...\n",

            "So anyway, so like I said, I mentioned I'm 41 years old. If I'm lucky, you know, I realize I'm halfway through my... right now I'm halfway through my life. So you know, get nervous, you know, about dying, you know, just growing old, man. I was never really nervous about it till I got to this age, and you know... You know, once I went to my grandmother's 100-year birthday party and I quickly realized that women age a lot better towards the end. You know, guys, we hang with them in the beginning because we're young, and then in the middle they're having kids so we kind of pass them, but that end, that last third, we're like the stock market. We just... we just go right down to the ground. It's brutal. I went to this party. All the old ladies, they were unbelievably shocked. I was still playing cards right there. But some of the old dudes, man, they were brutal. You know, you ever see a guy like so old he has like that permanent look of horror on his face? There's always that one guy just... because walking in just like, \"Good...\" Even when they're sitting down meeting people and this is my grandson Bill, it's like, dude, how much pain are you in that you constantly have a look on your face like that... from \"The Ring\" just crawled out of the TV set? So that's gotta be... You're like so old like everything hurts. You just standing up where you gotta lean... uh... So even like blinking like hurts. \"Here... Don't... Kill me... Kill me...\" If I ever end up like that, dude, I'll... kill myself. I'll rock myself down a flight of stairs. I'll lean back, hit my head on a sink, whatever I gotta do. I told you I didn't think about killing myself twice a week at this age. There was no... way I'm going out like that. The end of my life I'm walking around, everyone else has that panic doll... Is it going down? What's in their face? I don't know how you do it. How do you wake up every morning, brushing your teeth? How do you fight the urge just jam that toothbrush right down your throat? I'll tell you what kills me. It was only the old guys had that look on their face. None of the old ladies did. Some of the old ladies had a look of like mild disappointment, you know, just sit... like they always wanted to go to Europe but they never got around to it. But only the old guys had like their... It was almost like they wanted to tell you a secret like, \"Where's the gold? Can you remember the combination?\" What is that? Somebody said it's like a mild form of dementia. To make sure you know what I think it's from, I think it's from being married for 60 years. Get nagged everyday and never once looking at your wife mean like, \"You know what? How about you shut the fuck up?\" Is the better today? Like wear you down? I think that where you're done. And then it was a young man. I had a lot more spring of my stuff. Young guys, the girl gives you shit, you know, go for a drive. \"Where's this relationship going? This feels weird. We need to talk.\" And fuck you, lady. You get in the car and go for drive, punch the ceiling a couple times, you scream out the window... Then what happens? What happens? Just stay in the relationship. Stay in the relationship, right? You get married. 15 years later, you got a couple of kids, you got a little gut going, right? She starts in one yin with that whole laundry list of stuff you got to do 'cuz you're married. \"Suzie has ballet practice. It gets over... It... to make sure you... there to... you... there to... you... The other day that she's very upset.\" \"No, you were... You're where...\" \"I actually documented the record of my Facebook.\" \"They do... I do... Want to give her an uppercut?\" \"Do you want to give her an uppercut?\" No, it's an actual thought. It's a natural thought. But you don't... you never leave with an uppercut. You set it up with a jab and get inside. You come right up through the cleavage. You rock that head back to set it right across the linoleum. Make that dirty pistol out. You're laying next to... Wipe off the door handle.I'm fucking with you. No, I... You should never hit a woman. You're gonna get caught. You're gonna go to jail. You're gonna get raped. It's off. What are you doing? What are you gonna do now, right? You're married, right? You can't yell 'coz your kids are there. You can't go for a drive. You don't have a cool car anymore. I got like some caravan with those sticky children of the core and handprints all over the windshield. So what do you do? You go down in the basement. You just do like that whisper yelling. And then I think just one day you get... you just too old. It's just too old. You're tired. You've been married like 60 years. Your body's breaking down. You blew your knee out at the Y playing pick-up ball like 30 years earlier in the 50-and-older League, you know, and you just want to watch the game. And she comes in that one last time, right? Just to annoy it. Just picking on ya. \"You always mean to my mother and I always resented you for... What... Get your bad boy... Your brother...\" Right? And you start do you... to some number since it's right. You go to get up and that's when it hits you that the day before was the last day you went the quad strength to get up and out of your favorite chair. And that's when the panic sets in. You're like, \"Oh my god, I gotta listen to this for the rest of my life...\" Alot of people don't realize it, those old guys are actually trying to escape.\n",

            "I love seeing people out now, man. It was, you know, that was a... up couple of years, dude. We all had to just hide like none of us knew anything or really what to do. It was terrifying, man. I had a kid right before COVID. Like, I never led anyone through anything. No one looked to me for advice ever, and all of a sudden I had a family at the beginning of just like a global crisis. And I don't know, I don't know how I handled it. I... I still... you know, time will tell. But like, my wife freaked out, dude. I remember the day she found out. She came up to me like... she was like looking for guidance. She's out of breath, she's watching the news, she's like, \"Oh, they're saying some Chinese guy ate a Pokémon and, uh, we're gonna die! We just... we can't go outside! What are we gonna do?\" I did no research, dude. I looked at my wife and I was like, \"Look, it's all... all right.\" I'm not saying I'm right for that. I'm just saying that's... that's what I did because I wanted to go do stuff. And then I had to like stick to the story because that was like day three. It started ramping up. We were watching the news and they'd be like, \"37,000 people died today,\" and I'd be like, \"That's just statistics.\" That's... talking to a friend, or friend would be like, \"My aunt just died of COVID,\" we're like, \"So sorry to hear that.\" On the way home I'd be like, \"Yo, your friend's a liar, dude.\" Crazy. But yeah, that was... that was a weird time to have a kid. Like, my first kid, dude. You know, just like have to deal with all that and then they had to like, you know, be a new father, which, you know, it's... it's difficult, man. Everyone like kind of like laughs like, \"Oh, you better take a nap. You're gonna be sleepy.\" It's like, it's not funny, dude. Like, I'm... I have brain damage from the lack of sleep. I like, see out of the corner of my eyes now. So you're very sleepy, and also—no one talks about this part—you're also, as a new dad, you're like weirdly horny all the time. You are, because you know... don't be shy, sir. He knows. Yeah, it goes like, you know, your wife just gave birth so it's like... she's... the pussy blew up, dude. The pussy's out of order. Pussy's a Led Zeppelin, dude. Crashed. Your body doesn't know that. Your body's just like three weeks into the thing, it's like, \"Yo man, we got all this cum. What's up, dude? What are we doing?\" Not right now. So then you go on like a 40-day no-fap out of necessity, walking around, and people just started making fun of you. Make... people on dads like, \"Look at this guy. Look at this dad bod. Look at his belly.\" It's like, \"Dude, this is a cum tumor, man. Metastasized.\"\n",

            "It's hard to figure out how to be a dad, you don't know. Because, in order... here's the thing: in order to become a dad, you have to be a guy at some point. At least a guy who is trying to get... but in order to be a good dad, you can't be a guy who's trying to get. You know what I'm saying? Like, case in point: the dude from Maroon 5, Adam Levine. He blew it. You know what happened to him? He messaged ladies on Instagram. He couldn't help it. He had too cool of clothes on. He was like, \"I deserve more.\" He couldn't do it. He was... a millionaire with a beautiful wife and family, and even him, he's in a finished basement on Instagram being like, \"I got to see this lady's butthole. I don't care.\" He... he threw it away. So as a dad, you got to lay low, man. You want people fucking making fun of your gear? \"This guy, look at him, he's dressed like a dad.\" It's like, \"Dude, I'm 37 with two kids. Should I wear like a v-neck with like ripped jeans and cheat on my wife, dude? What do you want me to do?\" I've studied the art from my father. My dad is nasty at dressing to make sure he never gets pussy ever. He's the Sensei, dude. He's unbelievable. He comes up with these clothes. He's like, \"Dude, this is a button-down fishing shirt. They have vents in the back for sweat. It comes right out.\" Oh, my dad just steps into a pair of Sketchers and becomes invisible to women, dude. It's fucking awesome. Making kids is crazy, man. It's like... here's the thing: like, you don't realize how out of control you are of your life until you have like kids. Like kids plural. The first kid, you still don't really know. Like, anyone can have one kid. It's like getting a DUI. Your second kid, that's when you're like, \"Oh, I'm not in control of this at all.\" Because after the first kid, it was such like a... I was so thunderstruck by the whole experience. I started like telling my wife, I'm like, \"Look, we're gonna like... we're gonna plan the next one. We're gonna wait a little bit, save some money.\" My wife was like, \"Come inside me.\" I was like, \"Yes, ma'am. Ahhhhh! God damn it! What the hell was that?\" Do you ever like eat a muffin before and like afterwards like, \"Wait, I didn't even know I ate that thing\"? That's what it was like. What part of me just ate that? Total autopilot, dude. It was... to be fair to me, it is the best feeling in the world, coming inside of your wife. Specifically, just be respectful here, your wife. Not your girlfriend. That's the worst feeling in the world, dude. You get that in the principal's office stomach. You're like, \"Oh fuck, man. Fuck, they're gonna tell my mom.\" Not your wife. That's sweet, dude. It makes me feel like such a gross idiot that like, that was my favorite thing. I traded three years of sleep to just go \"eeeuuhhhhh.\" That feeling is the best, man. That fucking just... that lightning bolt. I figured out that's what that feeling is. That's like... all the fun you would have had without kids leaving your body at the speed of light. It's like... it's a decade of free time, 200,000 bucks. You're like, \"Oh fuck.\" And there's that like last little bit, that's... you know, that's stuff you push out of yourself. It's like a weekend trip to Atlantic City. You're like, \"Fuck it, I don't... I didn't want to go to that.\"\n",

I said, \"Damn, dude, I didn't know what the guy was dealing with.\" I thought it was just kind of like an angry fella every now and again. I didn't know... I didn't know he was a deeply sexually frustrated man. I just let him suffer, dude. I could have been, you know... there had been something I could have like, at least like wingman for him, dude. At dinner, it's been sitting at the table and like, \"Dude, Mom, Dad works pretty hard, doesn't he? Guy works his fucking ass off, man. It's like... it's like do you want me to do the dishes? You guys should watch a movie or something.\" Yeah, man. A new dad's only solace, there's the occasional... the occasional pity hand job. They're great. I mean, dude, hand jobs are our flowers.

            "It's not all about dads. Women go through it too. Moms go through it. It's terrifying watching a woman be pregnant. Jesus, I'm so happy I don't have to do that. That shit sucks, dude. You just... you're a sweet wife, dude. She's like six months pregnant, she's like, \"How do I look?\" And you're like, \"Like a fucking thing's grown inside of you. Look like a freak.\" Can't say that. That's the thing: when you're with a guy, you got to make sure he's not like a squeamish guy. If your guy's squeamish, he's not going to make it through the pregnancy. Kick him out, dude. My wife got so lucky because like... like women are already, you know, self-conscious enough. When they get pregnant, it's like everything's changing. They need to look to you to be a rock. You can't flinch at any of it. Like, dude, my... my wife, the poor fucking thing, would get these blogs. She's like, \"Oh, this one's saying that when I'm pregnant, my nipples are going to get really big.\" And it's like, dude, I've saw all the videos. Probably like that big. Thank you. She's lucky I'm such a pervert. Anything she was worried about, I was like, \"Nice, dude. Nice. It's actually hot.\" Anyone here ever drink the breast milk? No? No, you tried your sister's breast milk? I'll be back, I gotta beat off. Uh, can't say shit like that to me, man. God damn. Oh well, here I apolog... good job. I applaud you for that. That was weird you guys did that. I did it out of necessity. My wife, you know, she was having a tough time. When women breastfeed, their milk ducts can clog, and you know, she was like sitting on the bed, she's like, \"Ah, it hurt.\" She was describing it, she was like, \"It's like a dull, pressurized ache,\" and I was like, \"Oh, I know that. I was like, I think my ducts are clogged right now.\" I was like, \"Well, use your pump, man. Get the pump.\" She's like, \"The pump's not working,\" and we just stood there awkwardly and looked at each other. I was like a vampire at the threshold of the door. I was like, \"Invite me in, just say the words.\" I looked at her, I was like... she was like, \"You would do that?\" I was like, \"I thought you'd never ask. Get out of the way.\" Yeah, 'cause it's crazy because like the milk, you have to like stimulate it. Like it will eventually let down. So I was just on those things like a little suckling, dude. I was on there like, \"Um...\" She's like, \"Oh my God, the milk's letting down!\" I was like, \"Okay, just let me know when.\" I backed off and jerked your nipple off. Ew, it got... it got off. \"Get me a towel.\" No, I'm kidding. I took it to the dome, dude. I jammed. I was like, \"Wuuh.\" Thank you. Thank you. Yep, yep. I drank about eight ounces. I woke up the next morning, I think... I think I grew like an inch. I was like, \"Oh... oh yeah. Sweet stuff works.\" Oh man.\n",

            "We have two daughters, man. I love my daughters to death. We have two daughters, and people get weird about daughters. Especially a lot of men will be like, \"Oh man, when are you going for the boy?\" And I'm like, \"I'm good with my girls.\" They're like, \"I just need... I need a boy. I need someone to carry on my empire.\" It's like, \"Dude, you drive trucks for Pepsi. What the fuck are you talking about? Shut up.\" Don't tell me I need a boy. If I want a boy that bad, this day and age, I can, you know, flip one of my daughters. I can... they come with that setting now. You'll be like, \"Boy mode, go.\" You can... I think that's one area of life women have it easier than men. Just there's one, and it's trancing. Can we be honest? I feel like a woman becoming a man? Cakewalk compared to a guy becoming a girl. That's a journey, dude. For... in all kinds of impossible beauty standards. It's not fair for us, dude. All a woman has to do to become a man is just buy like one flannel, throw in a shitty haircut, and we're like, \"What's up, brother? Welcome.\" I would never trans. I'm being honest. I have nothing against it. I just... it's not for me. I know... I know myself. I know if I did it, I wouldn't do it for the right reasons. That's why I don't do it. I would use it... like I'd use it. It'd be a power thing. Like if I trans, I would do it... I would like become the most beautiful woman possible, and then I would find like anyone who's ever bullied me and I'd blow them. I... it... I blow them and halfway through pop up like, \"It's me! Ha ha ha ha ha! Who's gay now, dude?\" I'd be like, \"Uh... us, I guess. We're gay. All right. Uh... dang.\" But now women have it... women have it tough, man. You know, I have daughters now, so I'm looking up women's issues. I'm... I'm trying to champion them. You guys got a lot of stuff going on. I've noticed... I went on Google the other day, came across a gender pay gap. I was furious. I just stopped. I was like, \"Women have been getting paid 20% less for a hundred years for the same job as men? That's ridiculous, dude. That's unacceptable, dude. Women are bad enough with their money as it is. We can't... we can't do that.\" It took you guys 100 years to figure out you're getting paid 20% less? You dumbasses. I'm a dad now. This is tough love. Listen up, ladies. Come on. I've read an article. They said it's gonna take 437 years to fix the gender wage gap. I saw that, I was like, \"Girl math.\" Easily. It's gonna take like 400 years. It's like, no it's not. You're good. You could fix it tomorrow. Literally all you have to do, if you're a girl, you're at an interview, they slide you your job offer, look at it, poker face, and go, \"I'll have the boy salary, please.\" Slide it right back. And if they give you... just pop out a flannel and button it up like, \"We're so sorry, sir. We had no idea.\"\n",

            "Yeah, I'm a pretty good guy, I'll be honest. Love my kids. I rescued my dogs. That was heroic. Yeah, man. I mean... yeah. Oh please, please. Yeah, keep going. Keep it up. All right, hold on. I'll be honest. I'll be honest. I'll be honest. It was a bit of a financial decision. I was looking at boxer puppies on Craigslist for like 800 bucks, and I was like, \"Yeah, let me see what's up with those autistic pit bulls down there. Let me head down to dog Walmart and see if I can't get a deal.\" Dude, when you rescue dogs, they make you fill out like 40 pages about yourself. I had to fill out this big booklet. I got two pages into it and I stopped and I ate it. I'm like, \"Hey, why do I have to fill all this stuff out?\" It's like, \"We have to make sure you're gonna give it a good home.\" It's like, \"Aren't you guys going to kill it? Isn't that the whole business model? You guys are gonna murder this dog, right? So let me just... let me take it.\" Did you ever ask 'em how they do it? I asked him. I was like, \"What do you guys got, like a little Snoopy house with the guillotine? And how do you guys fucking blow them up?\" I don't... I don't know how they do it. Maybe they use fucking... this pack of tennis ball with C4. He's like, \"Go get it, buddy!\" Huh? *boom* I'll be honest, I didn't... you know, I didn't realize that when you rescue dogs, when you get them from that place, they're like mentally traumatized and like fucked up. I didn't know. I brought my dogs right from the place to a dog park. My bad. That was my bad. I let him in. I didn't know. I opened the gate, my one dog ran in there like, \"Who the fuck's been talking shit?\" and just nailed another dog. It was a big deal. The owner picked their dog up like, \"I'm pretty sure you guys should leave now.\" And it's like, dude, my dog won. I don't know. I don't know. People love telling you they rescued dogs, man. I see bumper stickers about... I saw a bumper sticker recently. I was behind a car in traffic and the bumper sticker said, \"I didn't rescue my rescue dog. My rescue dog rescued me.\" It's like, dude, call your parents, man. Just call. They'd love to hear from you. Just call them up. It's like, we're in traffic. I'm like, \"Dude, this sucks enough. Now I'm thinking about your life.\" \"My rescue dog rescued me.\" That's like the weirdest way to tell everyone behind you you've seriously considered killing yourself before. Like, \"I rescued you from what?\" \"Myself.\" All right. Yeah, I'm kind of weird about dogs, man. You know, I'm joking around about blowing them up and stuff. Like, people don't like that, and I get it. I get that. But here's the thing: I have like a little void within me about dogs. It's like an emotional block because like when I was younger, my... my dad would always put our dogs down, but like just a little too early. Like they were old, he's not a monster. Someone dies and they're 99, you're like, \"Yeah, good.\" You know, whatever. It'd be like if they were like 70. He just liked the new model, I don't know. I can't... there was a time, one time we went to go put our dog down. It was a little Jack Russell. I was like nine years old. I'm holding it in the back of the car. I'm like, \"I'm gonna miss you so much.\" Her name is Maggie. I'm like, \"Maggie, I'm gonna miss you so much.\" My dad's like, \"All right, we're here. Wait in the car. I'll be right back.\" He came back like 10 minutes later, just threw the dog in my lap. He's like, \"That vet's a pussy. Come on, we're out of here. Don't get attached. We're getting a second opinion.\"\n",

            "Parents are good people though, man. My parents, honestly, are... they're like... they told me a lot about life, man. They're very hard-working. They're kind. They're very salt of the earth. They're very like... they're wonderful people. But like, dude, here's the thing: you don't realize how much your parents have in terms of book smarts until you get like a little bit older. Like it did... first and second grade, they'd help me with my homework. They're just like, \"Dude, circle, square, red, blue,\" and I was like, \"This guy's a wizard, man. This is crazy.\" But then I remember around like fourth grade math, they'd start being like, \"No, you got it. You go.\" Help them... to be fair, the problem was one-half divided by one-fourth. I was sitting there, I was like, \"Dad, I don't understand.\" He was like, \"How hard can it be? It's fourth grade. They got you dividing fractions.\" It's like, \"Aren't they already divided?\" It's like, \"That's what I'm saying.\" And he had a good idea. He goes, \"Go to the back of the book. They keep the answers back there.\" All right, here we go. Flip to the back of the book. It's one-half divided by one-fourth. The answer is two. We just looked at each other like, \"Right on. For sure.\" It has like... went outside and played. I was like, \"What the fuck was that?\" It's one thing to have your... your parent confused by the question, but to also be mystified by the answer is tough. It's tough, dude. Though to be fair to him, dude, I still don't understand. If you have one-half of a pizza and you divide it by one-fourth of a pizza, you get two brand new, fresh, hot, delicious pizzas delivered to your door in under 30 minutes or less. No?\n",

            "Yeah man, my uh... my parents sent me to a Catholic grade school, which was fantastic. Another great move. Catholic grade school in the 90s was weird because I think they were still figuring out how to do it. Like all my teachers, they were all women. They didn't hire any dudes. It was all women teachers who cried five times a day. These ladies would just start crying. They're like, \"Hey...\" They start crying. I'm like a little kid being like, \"Look, Linda, everyone's 30s are tough. We're gonna figure this out.\" Personally, I think you should be fired if you cry as a teacher more than three times. Three strikes. I just... I have no... I have no patience for that, man. Like dude, I couldn't... I couldn't see a group of kids getting to me like that. I would destroy them. Be like, \"I'm a loser, okay? Yeah. Oh well. Yeah, that's why I made twenty-seven thousand dollars last year, dude.\" Let's be beeping my mom's car out the window. *imitates using car keys* I'm like, \"Yeah, that's basically mine right there.\" Yeah, I went from there to an all-boys Catholic High School, and Jesus Christ, that was worse. I went from crying ladies to senile priests. When priests lose their minds, it's like... do they go pure Da Vinci Code? It is so scary. These guys are fully losing their minds. We'd be sitting in class and they were just... we... this one guy's name is Father Mukluk. Just fire him based on the name. It's like, no, he was nuts, dude. He... he stopped class one time. He was just... we're sitting there, you know, we're learning. He was like, \"Boys, if you're going to masturbate...\" We're all like, \"We just quit, dude. We're all... we're all in a patch, dude. We're cold turkey.\" It's like, \"Boys, if you're gonna masturbate, make sure you look at yourselves in the mirror and don't think about girls.\" This was Spanish class, by the way. I was like... and then the next day he came in, he's like, \"Boys, if you're gay, you go to hell.\" It's like, \"Dude, you try to fuck us yesterday, man. Which is it?\" That used to scare me when I was little. When the priest would be like, \"If you're gay, you go to hell.\" I was always like... I was a little kid, man. I didn't know. I had two older brothers. All they did was call me gay. I, for a while, thought I was going to hell for being bad at video games. That was such a terrifying way to picture God as a child. Like I was trying to like really get a good sense of what God was when I was younger, and I was like picturing like a... like an aggressive frat bro ruling the universe. Just some guy staring down on Creation with like a cut-sleeve robe, just like, \"What the fuck, dude?\" You imagine that guy watching your life? That's terrifying. Just pausing it at the end like, \"Dude, you let your ex-wife play with your ass in Punta Cana. It's kind of gay, bro. You gotta justify yourself.\" You're like, \"Dude, I was at the fucking pool bar.\" He's like, \"Oh, day drinking? Sicck, dude. Going in there. Yes, I'm in.\"\n",

            "Yeah, people don't really care, I feel like, about like the, you know, traditional gay stuff. You know, gay marriage, all that stuff that was a big deal a while ago. Nobody really cares anymore. I think that's a good thing. Weirdly though, there's still like five bakers down south fighting the fight. You know, those like cake shop owners who won't make cakes for gay weddings? They're like Rambos in the woods, dude. They don't know the war's over. That's such a weird arena for that type of thing too. Like, two gay men walk into a cake shop and the owner's just jerking off an icing bag like, \"Dude, we love in this cake shop. We're not down with that, you guys. Here, let me get back to finishing this sugar dove. I'm gonna finish this cake and finger my wife, dude.\" It's like, \"Get out of my cake shop, you guys.\" That's like the gayest way you can be homophobic, I don't know. Here's the thing, though. Here's the thing: they do have the constitutional right to deny services to whoever they want, and I love the Constitution. So it's... it's shitty because the Constitution does rule, but also it's like, make the boys some cake. I feel like, here's what I think we should do to solve the problem. It's like, all right, cake shop owners, they have to make the cake. It's in the law, you gotta do the cake, but they can make whatever cake they want. Just a seven-tiered layers of hell, fucking just two melting grooms or whatever, I don't know. Speaking of gay guys, I uh... I have a food allergy. I have a gluten allergy, dude. It sucks. I know it sucks. My uncles all give me... they're like, \"You just do this gluten stuff for attention.\" It's like... it's like the only attention I get is you guys calling me a f**. That's... I don't want that, dude. They picked me off. I go to family parties, I walk in, I have my whole family with me like, \"Oh shit, Marsh, it's Matt. You can't have bread. Uh, do we have any bowls have cum in the refrigerator?\" I'm trying to do a comeback. I have nothing. I'm like, \"Dad, that would be so much cum. There's no way you guys fucking...\" \"Yeah, it is.\" It's, you know, it's weird having a food allergy because like, you know, people on like weird diets, I'll try to recruit you when they find out. They're like... like my brother was a vegan for a while. He's like, \"Dude, you got to go plant-based.\" He almost had me. Like, I do like the idea of not hurting animals. I was like, that is pretty compelling. But I have a problem where I always see both sides of things, so I also kind of dig the idea of killing a creature and absorbing its powers by eating its flesh. But for me, where I kind of like, you know, where I tab out... I don't like with vegans, I don't like when they eat imitation meat, when they eat like soy chicken and tofurkey. I don't... it's not for me. It's just weird, man. It's like, you're doing the thing you say you don't. That's like walking around saying you're not gay and sucking on a dildo. That's how I feel. Then you got to be like, \"I mean, yeah, technically you're correct, but uh... that's a very strange choice.\" Like, \"No man, it's a textural thing. It's just... there's something to be said for that real dick feel. You gotta try it, man.\" All right, take your word.\n",

            "So now I have to go to Whole Foods, you know. If you have a food allergy, you have to go to Whole Foods. They have all the stuff you need. It's annoying because it's all so expensive. The food there is just ridiculous, and it's also like a culture shock to go from like a normal Philadelphia grocery store to Whole Foods. You go to Whole Foods, everyone's all like, \"Ah!\" They're all peppy like, \"Well hey, what's up man?\" Like, I'm used to like regular cashiers like an Acme, just ladies just fucking slumped and defeated, dude. Just a grandmom with two big wrist guards on their arms fucking slug into Deer Park like it's wiping tears off the belt. Fucking... that's what I'm talking about. You're going to Whole Foods, they pick up every item like, \"Oh, what's this? I never had this before.\" It's like, of course you haven't. You're a cashier. You can't afford this shit. The fuck... in the bag. Everything there is expensive, dude. Everything in Whole Foods is super expensive, and the reason why is kind of a weird reason. Like, every product in Whole Foods is designed to make you feel like you're a good person. Like everything... you pick up a bag of sugar, it's like, \"Two percent of the proceeds of this sugar go towards some kid in a fucked up country. The kid is so sad, it's having such a bad life, and his mom's mean to him too. And if you buy the sugar, we'll give them some shoes maybe.\" And you're like, \"Oh, that's nice.\" I get all invested. I'm like, \"My boys out there!\" You fill your cart with all this stuff, you're like, \"Dude, I am a good guy.\" Let me go check out and you see the sales tax, you're like, \"Ah, that goes towards bombs for that same kid.\" Dang it. Shoot. It does. I'm like, \"Yeah, maybe he'll get the shoes first. That'd be nice.\" You know, I can... pilot flies away from decimating a village like, \"You see the moccasins on that kid? Oh, it's nice to know there's...\" It is weird that products are designed now to like make us feel certain ways morally. That's a... I don't know, man. That's like when the like medieval Church used to sell indulgences where like you could buy your way into heaven. That's what it feels like to me. It's... it's kind of creepy. And it's funny because like, no one knows this, dude. The first company to do this was Stouffer's. They did this years ago. I think I was the only one who noticed. Stouffer's did this thing, it said \"Let's Fix Dinner.\" That was the whole campaign. They didn't do anything. They just put a fact on all their boxes of food. The fact was: \"Families who eat together more than five nights a week are 50% less likely to have children who abuse drugs and alcohol.\" That was it. You just go, \"Yeah, okay, sure.\" It's got nothing to do with Stouffer's. Like, if your mom's at home microwaving your dinner five nights a week, there's a good chance that she does drugs and alcohol, dude.\n",

            "Yeah man, it's tough. It's tough for the information, man. You don't know, you don't know what's what. I get tricked all the time. I constantly get tricked. Or a while back, I was in a vulnerable point in my life, and I saw this article about microdosing. And dude, honestly, it's cool, but like, the way it was presented was misleading. It was like, there was this thing. It was like, \"Silicon Valley executives are taking a little bit of LSD and a little bit of mushrooms and crushing it in the boardroom.\" I saw that, and I was all like, \"Am I not high enough at work? I thought I was. Thought it was pretty high.\" The hell? And then I had like a temp job at the time, so you know, I took a little mushrooms in the morning, and they called me like, \"Hey, we don't need you today.\" So I was just in my room like, \"Am I crushing it? I can't tell.\" I'll tell you what doesn't work for sure is macro-dosing weed edibles and working for your father for five years. That's not... it's not the way. That was tough, man. My dad does construction, so we'd be in like a trench. I'm running a tamper like, \"Dad, do you think worms are ticklish?\" See my father be physically disappointed, just fucking *hangs head*. You feel like, \"When I grow up...\" He's like, \"Dude, you're 32.\" I don't know, I don't know. But yeah, that period of my life, that wasn't a total waste of time. Honestly, I was basically... I was high for my entire 20s. I was just stoned all the time, and I like... I did learn some stuff. I learned some secrets. I think I learned... I learned some secrets, dude. I learned how to drive. By the way, I can be so stoned and drive, no problem. I'm not saying you guys do it, but like, I can tell you how if you wanna... if you want to know. If you guys might be high right now, you're gonna drive home, you gotta do what you gotta do. Here's if you're way too high to drive, here's all you do: Just... you just look at the road signs, and you do exactly what they say. I think that's what they're there for. You see \"35 miles an hour,\" you're like, \"Strapping in, there we go.\" \"No turn on red.\" I wouldn't dream of that. That's... yeah man, you got to be careful online, man. I always, you know, I try to like keep my YouTube algorithm clean of all the political stuff because that'll get me riled up. And I like to watch YouTube to fall asleep at night. I just watch videos, it just helps me pass out. But even like, sometimes like that, you think the safest video... People still get in like... We do this thing where like everyone's stepping on each other's necks to be like, \"I'm a good person, this person sucks.\" And like, we're running out of people to do it to now. So now it's just like, dude, I watched a video on Benjamin Franklin. Totally safe, this will be cool. It's like a 10-minute video, all those like diplomatic missions and inventions. The top-rated comment was some lady like, \"Yeah, he was a piece of shit. Womanizer. He cheated on his wife.\" Just fucking nuts. I'm like, \"That's what you're going after? Colonial-era infidelity?\" That's alright, ruining my night. But so now I'm making a case for abandoning my head. I'm like, \"Yeah, yeah, he cheated on his wife. They covered it in the movie, by the way. They didn't lie.\" I'm like, \"He also invented electricity.\" Imagine if it was always dark after 6 PM, and then it wasn't because of you. Ever see Benjamin Franklin's wife? Beat to hell. It wasn't her fault. All the women back then, they didn't have vitamins. They're all just... they all had those big thick truck driver forearms from constantly burying their kids. That's all they did back then. Fucking look it up. All the fucking kids die. Don't be... that's how it was back then. Benjamin Franklin's inventing electricity, his wife's just at home just burying quadruplets, just hitting the frosted ground like, \"I can't even right now. I hate Mondays.\" Comes home, he's like, \"Babe, you'll never believe this.\" She's like, \"Grab a shovel, Ezekiel Four's down. We gotta get him in the ground.\" Fuck, it is funny Ben got caught because like, dude, he was taking a boat to France before the internet and just fucking ladies, and he was like, \"No one will ever know about this.\" And then he fucking pussy-bragged in one letter, and we're like, \"Oh, got him. Fucking got him. Thy pussy was the bomb. Got him.\"\n",

            "That was a shitty time period to live, man. A couple hundred years ago, dude. Dude, that was like so tough, man. Dudes would just die. Like, there was guys whose lives would consist of them just walking in the woods one day and twisting their ankles and just laying there for two weeks like, \"Oh.\" Then they die. That was it. It'd be a family of 14 kids, the dad would go out to get firewood, just like, \"Himself to death.\" It would get cold, they don't sit there like, \"Dead.\" I like to take my modern problems and I filter them through like, \"Would this have mattered 300 years ago?\" It doesn't work. I still obsess over the dumbest stuff. It doesn't do anything for me, but it's a cool thing to think about, you know? It's like... like even dude, take our worst thing. Dude, take COVID. That sucked, that was bad. Could you imagine explaining COVID to Benjamin Franklin? You might get some perspective like, \"Oh dude, Ben, we got hit with a nasty pandemic.\" He's like, \"Oh, I got the little ones.\" \"But yeah, more like our 80-year-olds.\" He's like, \"You guys have 80-year-olds? Holy shit, man, that's great!\" \"Well, it also hit the obese pretty bad too.\" He's like, \"What? The obese?\" Man, then you get defensive. You're like, \"I heard you cheated on your wife actually. Let's talk about that. Let's focus on that, scumbag. He's a piece of shit for that.\" I would never cheat on my wife, man. I love her to death, man. My wife took me in at a bad time, dude. I was a divorcee. I was scandalized. That's tough to re-enter the dating field when you're... when you're divorced, man. It's hard, dude. You know, because like, you just... you get divorced, you just shatter your soul into a million pieces. Then you have to just eventually go on dates. You feel just like a blown-out vet. \"All right, I guess I'm going back.\" You're at Bennigan's with some lady and she's like, \"And that's when I discovered nursing was my passion.\" You're like, \"*make white noise sound* Ah.\" It was weird too because, like, you know, my wife, when we were dating initially, I had been married and she had never been married before. So that's like an awkward dynamic that it... that feels like... like you're watching a movie with someone where like, you've seen the movie and they haven't, you know? You're out in the beginning, they're like, \"This is great!\" You're like, \"Yeah... wait till you see the end. It's pretty sad. And up... it's pretty bad actually. You know, it's not that big of a deal.\"\n",

            "Now this: Clap it up. Your parents are divorced. It's not that big of... I'll clap it up right now. There we go. Yeah, yeah man. Yeah man, my parents are still together. Sorry about your parents, that's a shame. So, but no one would clap for... Is anyone engaged, by the way? Is there any engagements? Hey yo, there's the man right there! You did... you do the engagement photos? Oh, it's the best seeing your friend look like a huge... on Facebook. You didn't put on a pumpkin like... Brother, I did it twice. Don't feel bad, man. Second time's dark, dude. You're gonna Charlie's Angels pose like, \"I wish it was a real fucking gun. I'd shoot myself.\" Why are we in a park? Shit sucks. But no man, I'm married. I love it, man. I... I'm in a really hot interracial relationship. You guys know what I'm about. My wife's black and I'm Puerto Rican. It's pretty sick. Now I'm white. I'm white. I'm white. It is cool. My wife's a black woman. She can say like whatever she wants, total freedom of speech. It's awesome. She'll like... but she'll drag me into conversations where I have to be like, \"Hey, I don't know if you know this, but white guys are kind of on house arrest right now. You go ahead.\" Yeah, black women can say whatever they want except for Whoopi Goldberg for some reason. They're on Whoopi's ass, man. It annoys me. She would apologize recently for using the word \"gypped.\" Yes, you'd apologize to the American Gypsy community. She had to burn 30 seconds of prime time TV to say sorry to four toothless carnies. Just some guy fixing a ring toss like, \"That fucking bitch better take it back.\" *laughs* No man, my wife will just like drag me into these conversations where I'm like, \"I don't know, I don't know how to respond,\" man. It's like... like I invited her on a double date not too long ago, and it was like a kind of a weird situation. It's my friend, he's a white guy who just started dating this black chick, which first of all, I'm kind of like, \"That's my thing.\" Yeah, that's kind of annoying. And then it's like, you don't want to go on a double interracial date. Single date is perfect because like, you guys like, \"We're saving the world, we're so tolerant.\" Once you're in like a double interracial date, now you're like enthusiasts or something. It's... you're swirling a glass like, \"We like what we like,\" you know? It's weird. But I told my wife the situation. I'm like, \"Come on, man. We should go, you know? We haven't been doing anything. Let's go on a date.\" My wife was like, \"What kind of black is she?\" \"Level two?\" I don't fucking know, man. How to... can't possibly answer this. I learned about a lot of white stereotypes too, being with... I... I hear stuff I'm not supposed to hear. There's a lot of weirdly specific stereotypes about white people you guys probably have no idea about. I always like walking on conversations where I hear them and I'm kind of like... I just opened my door. I walked in on one recently. I open my door, my wife was talking to her aunt on speakerphone. It's a cultural thing and I... I open my door. I open my door. It's a custom. Be respectful. And I... I just opened the door to her aunt being like, \"You know white people don't care about their grandparents,\" and I was like, \"Ah, damn it, dude. Fuck. That one's true. That hurts.\" That's... I didn't know anyone knew about that. How the hell they know? It's true. My mom calls me every like five months. She's like, \"You know your great aunt Brady died.\" I'm like, \"Mom, do I... you'd have to go... Oh my God, fuck.\" All right, I have to go literally ID the body at the funeral. I go and I'm like, \"Oh fuck, that lady.\" Uh, I hate funerals. Then you have to like try to like talk to a dead person in your head. It's always... I just panic. I don't know what to say. I just like... it's just like I just rattle off some shit Ice-T would say on NCIS and... \"Crime doesn't pay, you fucking punk.\" *laughs*\n",

It's not all fun and games, man. We do deal with stuff. We still have a race problem in this country, you know? A lot of perceptual stuff, you know? Like there's just like... sometimes you will just be looked at differently, and I... you know, it is what it is. Like, I... Here's the thing: I bought us a pair of matching sweatpants from Walmart. I thought it'd be funny. It's not. Nobody likes it. But there's like pattern, weird-looking sweatpants, and like, we still have them. So sometimes like laundry just works out the way we're... we're just out of stuff and we both wear them. We don't even think about it. We'll be out like running errands in our matching sweatpants, and we'll be like... like arguing in the electronics department at a Target. And I'll see the people looking at us who work there, and I know they're thinking we're one of those crackhead couples. I know whether they think, you know, those couples that like walk along the side of the highway together, just visibly bound in failure for all to see. Just, you know, those guys. They always make me laugh. I'm like, \"Why the highway? What the hell?\" Checking Google Maps like, \"I said it's going to take five days and four hours. We're gonna take the turnpike. Come on.\" I love those guys. It's like the heroin Oregon Trail. You see them out there like God damn prospectors. See their sweatpants catch the wind, you're like, \"Oh my God, it's beautiful.\"\n",

Yes, you all the time, and I... dude, I'll put it down. I don't care. I'll put it down. Sometimes I forget, you know, and I'm like, \"All I'm asking you is just gently lower it.

Is that the end of the world?\" I'm like, \"What's the worst thing that could happen by it being up?\" She's like, \"I could fall in there at night time.\" Like, what? Do you run to the bathroom ass first and jump? What the fuck? So now I do. I put it down every time, but I also put that little one too. I put that down like, \"Fuck you.\" I dropped that down and I pee on it a little. You can't win arguments with women, man. They'll just destroy you. It's their game. You think you win, they'll wait like three weeks and just fucking lance you.

She's always trying to get me to like, kind of open up a lot, and you know, I appreciate that. But like, she's always like, \"I want to know like, what's your top fantasy?\" I'm like, you know, I don't... I'm old enough, I don't want to do anything new. It's like, you can... you take a chance on a fetish, you can't go back. Like there's some out there, if you bust that out, that's it. Like, sir, do you know what cuckolding is? You... you familiar with the term? Do you know what it is, ma'am? Yeah, it's when a man burns with a desire to see another man with his woman. We're not into it. He's freak. Dude, guys, that's an example. It's like, dude, you can't like rewind the clock on that. If you set that up, if you don't like that, that's a problem.

Dave!\" It's like breaking up a dog fight like, \"Come on, get out of there! Knock it off!\" That'd be terrible, man. My wife always, \"What's your top...?\" I don't know how to tell my wife that my top fantasy at this point is just a woman being nice to me. That's all I want. That's all I want, man. My top fantasy right now is we're driving, I make a left turn, my wife goes, \"Where are you going?\" I say, \"It's a new shortcut I figured out,\" and she goes, \"Cool.\" Oh babe, I'm about to turn off the GPS. She's like, \"Do it.\" I'm like, \"Oh my God!\" Yeah, but my wife, my wife, she's, you know, she's a more bold and kind of outgoing... My wife likes role play, which is, you know, I do it. Obviously, I'm a sexually desperate man, but bro, it's so weird because she'll just, you know... I don't have time to prepare for the role. She's just like, \"Bam, go,\" and I'm like... Because in order to have sex when you're married, before you have sex, you have to go out to dinner and eat like a ton of food, which most nights it ends up with like two just stuffed people looking at each other going like, \"Nah, scrap it. We'll do it later.\" But on this night, you know, the planets aligned. Sitting on a couch, we're full, just grossly making out. A married couple just... uh... just like two slugs mating, just... uh... try to force blood to our genitals. Then my wife, you know, just brings a role on me. She goes, \"You're not going to tell my husband about this, are you?\" Uh... you want me to practice cheating on me with you? All right.

Actually, ma'am, good day.\" And you know, no, she's like, \"Seriously, don't ruin this.\" I was like, \"All right, fine, fine, fine.\" So I got into... I got real deep into character, dude. I grabbed the back of her head and I was like, \"Your husband's podcast is so fucking funny!\" Euuughhhh.\n",

            "I was a little too excited. I panicked and got this haircut. What an insane f**k up! My hair was fine. It was totally fine, and then two days ago I was like, \"I gotta, I gotta salvage this.\" It's crazy that I thought the hair... like, my hair was... I was like, 'If I fix my hair, I'll look good.' Like that was the final piece of the puzzle for me. There's a Dominican barber shop by my house in New York. I think I'm the first white guy that's ever been in there. I was basically Christopher Columbus of this barber shop, and they f***ed me up, dude. Don't get... if you're white, don't get a Dominican haircut. You end up just looking more racist. It was nice, though. He kept trying to reassure me the whole time. He was like, \"No, man, your head's good.\" Kept saying, \"Your head is good.\" I was like, \"Oh, thank you,\" whatever.

            "I'm happy. It's nice. Everybody's back inside. All that shit... I don't know, I enjoyed COVID. I had a nice time. I live in New York, so I left. I went back to my parents' house because I have white privilege. Some people didn't get to leave the city. I did because of my privilege, and I used it. You got to use it, you know what I mean? Does it feel more disrespectful to waste it? You know, then we're all just being racist for nothing. But no, it's good. I went home. My parents... haven't lived with them in over 10 years. They got old. They're old as f**k. They've milked, though. I'm back on milk. Been crushing milk lately. I got milk fat this year. It's a weird time in life to have a milk renaissance. It's 33. It was nice. I think my favorite part of the year was I... I got to watch my dad watch the news. It's a rough year for my dad and the news. He's a Fox News guy. Don't do that. It's fine. Also, I see you guys... most of you have Fox News dads. How dare you deny your fathers? That's a good dad. I don't watch Fox, but that's a good... Fox News mom, that's f**ked. You don't want Fox News mom. That's a bad mom. She smokes in the house. But a Fox News dad, that's a good dad. Can you imagine if you had a MSNBC dad? There's some guy every night at dinner like, \"We need to start focusing on renewable energy.\" It's like, \"Ew, dude.\" I didn't know Dad was gay. Talking to me about solar panels like a lady. He might have... We're straight as hell, dude. We hate the environment. That's how straight we are. All we talk about is eating and fracking. We hate nature. We go fishing. We don't even eat fish, do we? We just catch 'em and... no. He's good. He likes... He watches Fox. He watches it every night like every Fox News dad. My dad watches Fox every night until he can't. That's how long they watch. They watch every night until they get so angry they have to go to bed. My dad will watch for like two hours and then out of nowhere he'll just stand up and be like, \"Mr. Potato Head's trans? I'm going to bed. This world's going to hell.\" He's all about it, dude. He loves it. Like every Fox News dad, my dad watches Fox with one goal. He's just trying to get one fact. That's all he's doing. He's sitting there, he's trying to retain one piece of information that he can then relay to whoever's unlucky enough to enter the living room while he's watching. And you think it'd be easy to get one fact, but every once in a while there's like a commercial for like a commemorative 9/11 gold coin. Just wipes their hard drive. \"What was I watching? I gotta get one of those. I got my hands on those patriotic coins.\" My dad drinks too, so he can never... he can never get a fact. Ever. He'll come in the living room, we'll be... He's hammered watching the news every night, which is the wildest way to take in world politics. Like just hammered on a... in a recliner like, \"Whoa!\" It's like footage of rocket attacks in Israel. He's like, \"Whoa! What the hell are they doing over there? What's this guy's problem?\" But he can never get a fact. Like he tries, he tries. He... he uses Fox News as like a PowerPoint for what he's trying to say. Like everyone... like we'll be eating dinner and like Hannity will be saying something. He's like, \"See that? That's what I meant. Look at that. That's me talking. I can't say it that good.\" He can never get a fact. You'll walk in the living room, he's been watching the news for three hours. He'll be like, \"All right, what's going on in the world?\" He's like, \"Do you want to know? I'll tell you. Nancy Pelosi is a f**king bitch.\" All right, settle down, dude. That was the news... That's the news every night from my dad. They're just like, \"Breaking: Did you know Nancy Pelosi is a bitch?\" I had a feeling. But he likes everything they say. He agrees with... He's all in.\n",

            "I realize like Fox News is basically black church for old white dudes, you know what I mean? Like literally everything they say, my dad just says... Like, \"Yes! Preach, Tucker!\" Every once in a while he gets hit with the holy spirit while he's watching it. The holy ghost visits him. He's just like, \"Oh Lord! Build a wall!\" Can I get a wall? He needs a wall. My dad needs a wall. For a guy who lives in central Pennsylvania, securing the southern border is like oddly important to him. I don't know what he's worried about, like he's going to lose his job, you know? Like some guy from Honduras is going to walk the whole way to Pennsylvania, just slam his resume down on my dad's boss's desk. \"So you're here for the sales position?\" \"Si, quiet also.\" There... I was just at the border of Arizona and Mexico. There's a wall. I had no idea. I got down there, I saw the wall. I was like, \"Holy shit, he built it!\" They were like, \"No, it's been here. It's been here for like a century.\" You got to tell my dad. It's been f**king him up. He gets fired up every night. It's a crazy way to go to bed every night, just *grunts animistically* sleep apnea mask on. Every night, \"You caravan!\" Dude, you walk in the living room in my house right now, my dad, he'd hit you like, \"Southern border's a mess, right? It's crazy.\" But I make fun of him for it, and then I... I do the exact same thing, just with my phone every night. I just look at my phone until I can't. I'm like, \"Mr. Potato is f**king gay? That's it.\" Every day I just get on, read opinions from people I know are dumb. Like, in person I know they're dumb. I've talked to them. I'm still reading their Twitter, their political opinions. It's great. And my... my Twitter is crazy. It's... it's half where I'm from, which is the middle of Pennsylvania, so it's... it's white trash. And then half now, all... now I live in New York, so it's crazy like all... You know, I still have uncles, they all just got Twitter. They're all fired up. They're having fun, dude. They all have like zero followers. They just tweet into the void. They love it, dude. They do it for the love of the game. Like, \"Panera was good today.\" This is on to a server that'll outlast civilization. And then now all my new friends are literally communists from Brooklyn. So it's wild, dude. My social... like I'll get on, I'll get on Twitter and the first tweet I see will be someone from back home that's just like, \"F**king Colin Kaepernick better stand up. Like this tweet if you support the police. Share it if you're not gay.\" And then the next post is just one of my new woke white friends that's just like, \"I'm not racist.\" That's it. Every day for the last year, just a different white person popping up like, \"Look at me! Look at this article I shared to my Instagram story. I'm not racist, right?\" It's like, all right, are you sure? I don't know if you know this, like being racist isn't like a yes or no thing, you know what I mean? It's not like you have it or you don't have it. Like being racist is more... it's like being hungry, you know? It's like, yeah, you're not right now. You know, it's like, yeah, you're not hungry right now, but a cheeseburger could cut you off on the highway. You get hungry. We're hungry all day. The cheeseburger is Jewish in that joke. No? Okay. Cheeseburgers... whatever... whatever type of cheeseburger you thought it was in your racist heart.\n",

            "I just get online, read opinions from people. The news, like other news, is kind of like, \"This is the most divided this country has ever been,\" say with the like the red states and the blue states. It's like, why? Because we tweet at each other? You know we had a war, right? You know this country had a civil war. That was pretty divided. Like, at least nowadays we're communicating with each other. Back then, those guys never... they got the news like once a month. Some guy would come by on a horse and they were like, \"Who's talking?\" The guy was like, \"The South is talking.\" \"That? I don't like that. Give me my gun. I'm gonna go down there. I'm gonna walk... I'm gonna walk down there for a month straight, shoot the first f**king guy I see down there.\" The Civil War was basically just the North just shooting racism out of the South. That's what happened. The North was like, \"South, f**king chill,\" and the South was like, \"No,\" so a bunch of guys had to walk down there and shoot them a lot. And they're like, \"All right, we'll let them go.\" Or not. To be nice to them for a while until we find out they're good at football and then roll tide. Hey, roll damn tide. I don't like... I don't like Alabama football. I watched... I just watched this documentary on Alabama football. It's great. It's about... Well, it's not... I don't know if you should say it's great, but it's about... it's about Alabama football. It's about when they desegregated their football team. So up until this point, Alabama football was just white, all right? And everybody down there was pumped on that. They would pack the stadium, everyone would be like, \"Look at all those whites running around catching it!\" Hey, look, I'm not knocking them too hard because I still have a little bit of that in me, you know? Like if a white guy catches the ball on Sunday, I'm like, \"Oh shit! Go, go, go, go, go, go! Ah, they got him. They got him.\" It's a tough run. A smart run. That's a head's up run there. But no, they took it too far. And uh, so the documentary focuses on that. It focuses on Bear Bryant, Bear Bryant, legendary head coach. He was the head coach that brought the first black players onto the team. So the whole documentary is like celebrating Bear Bryant. They're like, \"F**king way to go, Bear! You did it! What a hero!\" And then you find out it was 1971. Yeah, well, a little late for high fives on this one, fellas. Holy shit. '71? Like, we had been to the moon. There were literally people on the moon before Alabama had black guys in their secondary. Does anyone understand there were white corners? White cornerbacks? You understand how preposterous that is? Some of... some of you are too young to have ever even seen a white corner. They're extinct. They don't exist. There... there's two left at the San Diego Zoo. They won't reproduce. You'll never see a white corner. But that's what happened. It wasn't like... the reason they desegregated the team, it was... that's what the documentary focuses on, which is great because it wasn't like, \"Oh hey, fellas, it's 1971, maybe we should get with the times.\" What happened was Alabama scheduled USC, Southern Cal. Alabama was confident. They're like, \"Oh, white boys will take on anybody.\" And then USC came down to Alabama with a bunch of black dudes from L.A., just beat the f**k out of Alabama. And then after the game, Bear Bryant gave like a speech, and he was like, \"Hey y'all, come on.\" That was it. That's all it took. Everybody down there was like, \"Yeah, we get it. We'll be less racist if it means we can win.\" What? That's what it is. Like, as big as racism is in America, football... that's true. That's true. Look, the... there's a Disney movie, \"Remember the Titans,\" dedicated to what I just told you. The whole point of that... dude, that was one high school football season. \"Remember the Titans\" was like... it was eight weeks. You know that whole town went from like centuries of like, \"Don't let them in our school,\" to just like, \"Oh shit, the high school team's 4-0. Those are my brothers.\" All right, I'll get off the topic. The point... Look, the point I'm trying to make... The point I'm trying to make is if you want to get rights in America, you just gotta put together a good football team, you know what I mean? Like if the transgenders... if the transgenders got together and put together just a f**king hard-nose, run-it-down-your-throat ball club. The trans... just three yards and a cloud of dust of transgenders. If the trans... if the trans community could just somehow upset Alabama, everybody down there tomorrow would be like, \"Those are some tough bitches.\"\n",

            "You know how like every show and movie now it's like a remake of something? They just remake an old thing and just make it like more progressive and just put it out. Like they remade... they remade Ocean's 11, like a heist movie with like all gorgeous women. That movie should have been 10 minutes long. They literally should have got to the casino and just blown the security guards. They've all... \"Here's the keys to safe. Take everything. I love you, you guys. You crazy. I love you.\" I just... that's it. That's all they make. They either make that or they make like... they make slavery movies every year. Those are for no one. I have black friends. I was like, \"Dude, you guys... do you guys like these?\" They're like, \"No, we thought you... These were for you.\" Like, \"No, we all hate those. Stop making them.\" It's uncomfortable. Civil rights movies are good though. I like... like uh... like \"Judas and the Black Messiah\" was sick. \"Remember the Titans\" is great. \"Hidden Figures\" was the movie about the black ladies at NASA. Or as my dad likes to call it, \"Medea Goes to the Moon.\" Look, that was him that said that. He said that. As soon as he said it, I was like, \"What did you say? You don't talk like that.\" So every movie is just remade, is more progress. I just think it'd be funny if like the right started remaking, you know what I mean? If they just start like conservatives... like there's a new Scooby-Doo coming out, and it'd be funny if like the right remade it. It's just like Scooby and the gang going around ripping the wigs off of transgender people. It's like, \"That's not a woman!\" Some guy: \"I would have got away with it!\" \"We solved the case of the Starbucks ghoul!\"\n",

            "Has enough time passed that we can... can we admit that Trump was funny? Can we finally admit that he was funny? Well, hold on. I don't... I don't like the tone of that. That's not what I'm going for here. Yeah, the great leader. He was funny. Now whether or not that's a great quality for the commander-in-chief, that's definitely up for debate, but he was funny. I saw it. And I lived in New York, so the whole time he was in office I would be like, you know, something would happen. I'd show my friends like, \"Look at that!\" They'd be like, \"What? It's funny.\" \"Okay, there's nothing funny about Donald Trump.\" I don't... I don't know. During Hurricane Dorian, he was like, \"Maybe we should nuke it.\" Like, that was... that was a real suggestion from the president. The president said that. The president of the United States. He was like, \"Hey, we got a big storm coming. You guys want me to blow it up?\" And I was like, \"No, what the f**k are you talking about?\" I don't know. I f**k around, dude. That's what I do. I don't know. Now that he's gone, I'll never... like I'll never watch a debate ever again. Can you imagine like just a regular debate now after we went... like we witnessed the GOAT, undefeated in debates, and he never said a fact. You know how impressive that is? He was funny and he argued like a fifth grader. He was unstoppable. People tried to hit him with statistics and facts. He would just go, \"Wrong!\" Holy shit, dude. How is no one prepared for this? Go back and watch those debates. You forget how... how good, how electric that was. Don't tell your friends in Austin. They'll be mad. Just get a six-pack, toss on a Trump highlight video on YouTube. It's a good night, dude. Why... I went back, I watched his first debate. That's like my favorite one. At the time, Trump was polling at like less than one percent. Like, he was... no one liked him. If you guys like him now, you didn't back then, and I know that because my dad... I watched my dad. My dad at the time, he would like, any time Trump even came on TV, my dad was like, \"Get this f**king joker... get him off the f**king screen.\" And then now my dad's like, \"Guys can't go to the Capitol. He's like, guys can't have fun anymore.\" It was because of the debates. That's what did it, dude. That's how we got Trump, these debates, and the first one is the best one. So it's a Republican primary, everyone's up on stage, and they're all still doing their political shit. So like the first couple guys that talk are like, \"I'm from Kentucky and I love education,\" and the crowd's like, \"Nice.\" We didn't know what was coming. Then the next guy's like, \"I'm from Georgia and I love religion.\" The crowd's like, \"Pretty good. This is a good one.\" It was a heated debate. And then I finally got to Trump's turn to talk, and he was just like, \"Rand Paul is ugly,\" and the whole crowd was like, \"Oh! We didn't know you could do that in this. You can just do that as your thing?\" And Rand Paul was like, \"All right, everybody, settle down. We're trying to have a debate here.\" And the whole crowd was like, \"Shut the f**k up, Rand Paul, ugly bitch!\" And we just kept throwing dorks up on stage to make him debate Trump. It was not fair. It was mean for us to have done that to people. These guys were in politics their whole lives, and they just had to debate a f**king maniac up there who didn't give a f**k, dude. And I hated... He was fun to cheer for him in the debates. It was fun to cheer for him in the debates because he... dude, he was going up against guys that had been in politics for like 40 years, and then he showed up to the event like, \"Oh f**k it, what are we talking about?\" He had no clue. Every week he had no f**king idea. There's one debate, there's one debate he's like in the middle of it going back and forth about the economy with Ted Cruz. They're literally talking about the economy, and in the middle of it, he's just like, \"Ted's wife ugly as a dog.\" Holy shit, dude. Ted was like, \"I'm from Texas. You don't talk about a man's family like that.\" \"You've got a dog wife, Ted. Everyone knows.\" Yeah, and a week later Ted Cruz was on TV like, \"I support Donald J. Trump\", you fucking pussy.\n",

            "I will say this: The one thing that sucked about Trump losing was, for me, was because I just figured out kind of how to do his voice. That's kind of a bummer that I just... It's not hard to do Trump. It's very... All you have to do, that just do that, do that a second off from where it should be in the sentence, and then all you... Like, you don't have to sound like him. All you have to do is like get his cadence down. It's very easy. All you have to do is like describe something and then say you described it that way. That's it. It's every time like, \"What a big room this is! I walked in here, I said, 'Wow, what a big room!'\" That's it, every time. \"Austin, a lot of homeless! I walked in here, I said, 'Wow, that's a lot of homeless! You guys got it, you got a lot of homeless! You gotta... What are you guys doing about it? Whatever you guys are doing is not working!'\" So cheap. Switch. \"I don't know what to do either, but do something!\" \"A lot of tents!\" Why? It's been making me laugh thinking about Trump like not understanding why people are homeless. \"I walked out, I saw 'em, I said, 'Why are you living in tents? I could never...'\" These guys! But I will say this about Trump... I don't want you guys to get... I don't want to turn this into a rally. I will say this, so don't freak out, just listen. I will... I think it's fair to say that of all the presidents we've had, I think it's fair to say that Trump would have been the funniest one to see get shot. You know? Dude, the patriots got fired up on that! Dude, I was having fun at this show! No, look, I didn't even say it would be funny. I said \"funniest.\" It's a huge difference! Technically, there's the funniest of everything. There is! It doesn't make it funny, but there is... Like, think of the worst thing you can think of. There's a funniest one. I'll go first, I'll think of one: school shooting. None of those are funny, zero funny, but maybe there was one where like the horse girl in the class like could sense something was coming, you know? I mean, they're like, \"What's wrong?\" and she was like, \"*horse noise*.\" But back to what I was saying about... If you had... What I said was true. If you had to rank them from least funny to funniest assassination, easy number one, really. He'd be talking shit like when it happened. He'd be doing like a rally: \"My opponent's gay! I walked in, I saw him, I said, 'Wow, this guy's gay!'\" The shooter would be coming out, be like, \"Sit down, you're gay!\" Get hit. He'd definitely make a funny noise into the mic, like he'd get hit, back... You fall funny. I will say, I did... I did write that joke before Biden could be added to the rankings. I don't think he would be the funniest, but the only reason Biden might be the funniest is because I think Biden's the first president you could punch-assassinate, you know what I mean? Just walk right through the metal detectors, be like, \"Mr. President, the fuck are you doing, dude? It's a body shop!\" I'd add that joke, but my dad's... \"You can't be talking about killing presidents!\" \"What about Biden?\" He's like, \"Yeah.\"\n",

            "My dad's... He's a good, good guy. He's an alcoholic, but he's good. He's like a good... He's a good alcoholic. He's not hurting anybody, but everyone's... He's always has an excuse while he's drinking. That's what's funny about it. Like, he can never just get hammered and be like, \"Yeah, I got fucked up.\" Like, it's always like... You'll see him on like a Monday, you'll be like, \"Damn, it's Monday. You're getting fucked up?\" He's like, \"It's fucking... It's Monday Night Football! Have a couple of drinks, geez!\" You'll see him on like a Tuesday, you'll be like, \"Damn, it's Tuesday. You're getting fucked up?\" He's like, \"It's fucking... There's no football! What the hell?\" And my sister does heroin and uh... And that one we're like, \"You do need to... You know, you need to stop doing that.\" Which sucks for her because if she played guitar, everybody would be like... Instead, she's a hairdresser, so it's not as cool. Relax, it's my family. It's my family, don't worry about it. Actually, based on this crowd, I'm sure it's actually a lot of your guys' families, and that's all right. We're allowed to talk about it. My sister, since she was doing heroin, we had to have an intervention for her. She lived out in Pittsburgh. We live in the middle of Pennsylvania, so we had to trick her to come home. You got to trick 'em. I don't know if you know these guys, they're not just fucking stopping by. They're very busy. They're the busiest people. They get a bad rap for being lazy because they take a lot of naps, but if they're awake, they're fucking very busy. They're scurrying around, dude, doing quests. That's what they do. If you do heroin long enough, you run out of money, you got to start doing quests. You know, it's... You know, it's like a fucked up game of Zelda. Every day you just wake up to a new quest. It's like, \"You need to gather copper!\" \"Gonna find a scrapyard!\" It sounds nice. I wish I got quests. But eventually, the quests get pretty dark. Scrapyard, that's like level one. Towards the end, the quest: \"You need to get titty fucked behind the Home Depot!\" It's when it's time for a change. So we had to come up with a plan to trick her to come home for the intervention. The plan we came up with was we told her that we had won tickets to go to Six Flags. And it worked! She called back, she's already all right. \"I'll be there! Just got on the first bus!\" It's like a seven-hour bus ride. There's nothing to them, dude. No, if you take heroin, every bus is a bullet train. It's a five-minute ride, tops. Anyway, so the plan was: pick my sister up from the bus stop, not take her to Six Flags. They could take her to a hotel where we're gonna have an intervention. I didn't want to start the intervention with like a lack of trust, so I took her to Six Flags the day of her intervention. The more that day... She and I went to Six Flags together, and I thought that was a nice gesture. But it turns out intervention is supposed to be rock bottom, you know what I mean? Like intervention's supposed to be the worst day of your life, not like you're tired from easily the best day humanly possible. I mean, she took heroin and rode roller coasters. It was... Dude, it was impossible. We sat down with, \"You better fucking change your life!\" She's like, \"I'm going back tomorrow!\" And I was with her. She was... She was fucked up. If you know anyone from Pittsburgh, you know what she was wearing. She was wearing a Steelers jersey and pajama pants. Steelers pajama pants. She dusted off her finest Heinz Ward for the occasion. So we get in there, there's a water park there. We didn't know they added that. We haven't been there since we were kids. We get in there, there's one of those water slides. It's just like a fucking straight drop, like no sides on it, no raft, just by yourself. She looks at it, she's like, \"I wanna go up on that one.\" I was like, \"Yeah, all right. Yeah, fuck it.\" You know, I knew she was going to rehab like that night, so I was like, \"Yeah, get this one in. You're gonna... You're about to have a rough couple months here.\" This is gonna be... Also, I figured they would stop her. She was wearing a Steelers jersey and pajama pants trying to get on a water slide. All they did was make her take her fucking Crocs off. Her yellow Crocs. So she's climbing up this ladder. She gets to the top of this fucking giant water slide. You know how like when it's your turn next on a water ride, you got to like lay there in that water and like wait to go? She... She nodded off. She took a nap up at the top, like a Dracula, laying in front of some high school lifeguard that's like, \"Uh, ma'am? It's your turn.\" Uh... He just sent her down, dude. Asleep. Sleep just flying down this thing, dude. She... There's a ramp at the end. She hit her... We all got to watch her wake up in air. She did the whole fucking... You know, I don't know how that wasn't fucking rock bottom. So you woke up in air. Anyway, don't be sad about it. She's good. She did go to rehab and that's good. Yeah, she's done. She stopped using it. She's sober. She's all good. Two years clean. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's good. She did uh... She did get cancer though. So... And COVID. Cancer and COVID. So I'll tell you what, this was cool. I got... I was with her. I lit... She was at home. She went back to my parents because when you have cancer and COVID, you got to go home. You have to go home. You can't keep hanging out. But no, I was with her. It was crazy. She... This year, she beat heroin, cancer, and COVID. It was... It was like living with fucking Rocky. It was crazy, dude. Every week my whole family was like, \"Give up! You're never gonna win this!\" She's like... Just kept winning. When she got COVID, I was like, \"All right, you... You're definitely dead.\" She was like, \"Yo, COVID! I ain't hear no bell!\" This bitch just wailed on it, dude. Yeah, she's got a hell of a chin. A hell of a chin on my sister. And that's what... Better quality could you ask for in a human?\n",

            "I like my family. It's a good family. I had to go to my niece's uh... 7th and 8th grade girls' volleyball match recently. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding, dude. Shut up, just relax. I don't want to... Kids, but if you ever want to get out of something, that's all you have to do. Like if your friend's like, \"Do you want to come to our son's t-ball game?\" Be like, \"What grade are the kids in?\" And then no matter what they say, go, \"Fourth? No.\" I went to this kids' volleyball match. Can we knock it off with volleyball shorts on little kids? It's weird. It's gross, dude. Just get them gym shorts. That's all. No, dude, it's gross because then you know it's just me and the other uncles up in the... Up in the bleachers kind of making eye contact with each other. \"Bro, are you seeing this?\" Such a funny way to just destroy a show, just right at the very end be like, \"Aren't kids hot?\" Yo, give it up for Trump. \"Aren't kids hot?\" No, I am... I truly am serious about the gym shorts though. It's weird. And so I got home from this volleyball match. My roommate, his girlfriend played college volleyball, so I'm very excited to like, on volleyball whenever I can. So I get in there and I was like, \"Yo, volleyball is... That's a weird culture. Get them shorts... Get them gym shorts. The shorts they're wearing is gross.\" And she was like, \"No, we need those shorts for speed on the court.\" And I was like, \"Uh, I know that's not true. I watched the NBA. None of you are moving as fast as like a ref, and those guys are wearing like slacks, dress shoes for some reason.\" She was like, \"No, we need those shorts. The tight shorts, they're essential.\" She compared 'em to like a helmet in football. I was like, \"I know they're not essential because I googled the uh... The Special Olympics volleyball team. All of a sudden those shorts weren't so essential for them. What's that about?\" How baggy do you think they're... They look like the And1 mixtape out there.

I just feel like the guy who came up with it had to be like a real risk taker, you know what I mean? That's a wild thing to suggest for the first time. Some guy in a board meeting like, \"I got an idea. We should be racing these...\" \"Like what?\" \"You say... Uh, town over said that the fastest ones... Say we settle it.\" You know, I'm not making fun of the Olympians. The concept is wild. It's a while... Like if your best friend invented the Special Olympics and told you about it first, you'd be like, \"Don't ever tell anybody that. Were you going to tell that to... What are you doing?\" Pal, uh... I actually personally... I actually volunteered and coached with the Special Olympics for a little while, so you know... What? You guys do... No, don't clap, please. I did it for those kids. I look like this, so me coaching the Special Olympics, I was like a double agent. No one knew whose side I was on, dude. Player? Chaperone? No one knew. I'd be standing there coaching, holding a clipboard with five dudes that looked exactly like me. I always see the coaches from the other team looking over like, \"I think they got... I think they're letting one of them coach.\" Yeah, no, I did coach this Special Olympics for a little while and it's fun. That's another thing you're allowed to talk about. It's happy, everyone there's sportsmanship. It is funny. Don't let anyone tell you it's not funny, dude. I was there. Everyone there is laughing. It's fun. I coach basketball. Kids would catch the ball, just... Just launch it into the bleachers. People be like, \"What the fuck you doing out there?\" My whole team ruled. Everybody, every dude on my team was... They were the funniest. They... They were bros. They're bros, dude. My whole team loved two things. They love tits. They do. I don't know if you know these guys, dude. They love the ladies. They love the ladies and they love John Cena. That's it. That was the news every day. We'd be in the huddle, there'd be like, \"A lot of ladies here tonight.\" It was like, \"Yeah.\" They'd be like, \"What do you think John Cena is up to?\" \"Oh, you're gonna have to get way worse before you meet him.\" See, it just... He's like the angel of death for those guys. I told my guys, I was like, \"You see Cena coming, you get the fuck out of there. He's taking souls with him.\" Every year, Hooters would sponsor our one basketball tournament. All right, so every year Hooters would bring like three or four waitresses and they would present like a big cardboard check donation to the Special Olympics. As soon as the girls entered the gym, the game changed entirely, dude. It went from like hugs and sportsmanship to just like... Dudes got competitive, like very competitive. Ripping down rebounds, just hitting layups, and then at the end of the game, there'd be a hug line, you know, between the waitresses and the players. And yeah, that went about exactly... Exactly how you would imagine that went. We had to break out the jaws of life, dude. My boys... My boys were ragged on those... Young and... I'm not knocking the... The players. They were totally in the right. The girls were hot. The waitresses... Like every year, I would sneak into the hug line myself.\n",

So this is like... like a few winters ago. Oh, I didn't know you would ever clap for that. Well, all right. That's the first time that shit's ever happened. Oh, anyway, uh... I live amongst the whites, small town in Ohio. And it was wintertime, and it had snowed recently, so huge snow strips on the street. I was walking with my sister. Now, my sister was dressed in all Muslim garb, as were her children, and I was dressed as Dave Chappelle. And we were walking and just talking about something, and a car sped around the corner and the window came down, and somebody threw a snowball and hit me right in my shoulder. I didn't know what's going on. Why was this happening? Because I'm black? Because she's Muslim? Because I'm Dave Chappelle? I couldn't tell. But again, I knew it was premeditated because who the fuck has a snowball in a warm car? Straight through, lady. Because he went around the corner and got stopped at the red light. He was caught in the traffic. So now I ran out into the street, and I just tapped on his window. \"Hey, my man, can I just talk to you guys for a second? Come on now, motherfucker. One second, I just want to talk to you.\" There's four young white dudes in the car. They're like, \"Just chill, bro. Relax.\" I just want to talk. Now, this is an old black trick. Really, I didn't want to talk. I was going to fuck them up. So if you're ever caught in traffic and the black guy starts saying he just want to talk to you, don't open the door, nigga. Even if he's me, smiling at you. And they were like, \"Chill, bro, just chill.\" And... and then the one guy in the back seat, I don't know what he was... just cockier than his friends. He was like, \"Fuck it, man. I'll get out the car.\" And I started yanking on this door. \"Let me help you, motherfucker. Let me just help you out.\" And I didn't notice his window was down, and he threw a snowball that hit me right in my chest. Wow. He said, \"Fuck you, you fucking nigger.\" And then the light turned green and they sped off. And I smiled from ear to ear. I looked at my sister and she said, \"I got the plates.\" And I was happy as shit because throwing a snowball is a misdemeanor assault. Me and my sister can't stop dancing. We gon' take this nigga to jail. Now, I didn't notice it, but while I was yelling at him, a crowd of all white people had formed because it was an all-white town. And I was like, \"Uh-oh,\" I thought it was going to get jumped. And one of the white guys stepped in was like, \"I didn't like that at all, motherfucker. This is not what this town represents. I don't want this goddamn stuff in my vicinity.\" And another white guy was like, \"Yeah, I didn't like it either.\" And then an old white guy stepped out of the crowd and said, \"Young man, if you're going to fill out a police report, I would like to come with you and do the same.\" I said, \"You guys would do that for me?\" And hope... I said, \"Hooray!\" I said, \"Come on, y'all!\" I look like Malcolm X going to see Brother Johnson with a trail of whitey. Shit, unreal. Hour later, we was all sitting in the police station, and police came in like, \"Well, Mr. Chappelle, 16 identical police reports. We ran the tags. Two young men that had their mother's car. We have all four suspects in holding. Their mother is here. It's up to you. Whatever you want to do. If you want to press charges, we'll move forward.\" \"Sorry about that, officer. I'm a little flustered. I've never been in a position where I could decide the fate of white children before. But it's weighing heavy on me, sir, and I really can't decide.\" And I saw a lady pacing back and forth in the hallway, and I said, \"Is that...\" \"Yes, that's their mother.\" \"Well, can I speak to her before I make a decision?\" And when the mom came in, she saw it was me, she busted out crying. \"Oh God! I don't know... I don't want him to go to jail. I am so sorry. I didn't raise him to do this. We love your comedy. We love you at the house.\" I said, \"Miss, please, just... all right, look. I don't necessarily want your son to go to jail either, but what he did was pretty... was pretty fucked up. So is there something we can do short of jail just to let him know that he's wrong?\" \"I don't know, I don't know. What did you have in mind?\" \"Miss, I've never been in this position before.\" \"Oh, you know what we could do? I don't know if I'm asking too much, but maybe if you... if you could just suck my dick a little bit. Just a little bit. I'm not gonna finish. I just want you to do it enough so that I can tell him you did it.\" I'm kidding. I wouldn't do that to anybody's mother. Maybe my kid's mom, but that's it.\n",

            "Ebola was in Texas. Ebola made a visit, killed that man in Dallas. Five days, that man melted to death. What happened to the brother in Dallas? Where was the secret serum? Is what we all said. I remember in the beginning of Ebola, there were two American doctors that got sick in Africa. They flew them in a private jet straight to Atlanta, to the CDC. I didn't even know CDC saw patients there. It was said they administered what the New York Times called a \"secret serum.\" I don't know what's in it. It's just like Colonel Sanders' recipe. But both of these motherfuckers survived. These doctors, thank God, are healthy. They are out there somewhere tonight at Whole Foods, touching vegetables, walking around. Everything's okay. \"Hey Frank, how are you?\" \"Oh, you didn't hear? I had Ebola last week, but uh, I'm doing all right now. I was bleeding out of my eyes and anus, so I got concerned, but I'm okay.\" What happened to the brother in Dallas? They just rub some Vicks on that? I knew he wasn't gonna make it. I already know. Sad. I saw in the New York Times, they said Ebola is the new AIDS. Isn't that something? Here I am thinking that old AIDS was working just fine, and they already have a new AIDS out. Isn't that amazing how they do that? And it's weird how there's a disease that just starts in 1980, and it doesn't kill anybody but niggas, fags, and junkies. Isn't that a fucking amazing coincidence that this disease hates everybody that old white people hate? I think either God is white, or the government hid that shit in disco balls. Only fun people get AIDS. Last month on the front of New York Times, the measles was a headline. I had to check the date of the paper. I was like, \"Measles? What is this, 1850? What the fuck is this? Why is measles in the news?\" Turns out they were trying to decide if mandatory vaccinations for children is the way we all want to go. Any thoughts? I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen. I just, uh... I don't know. I don't know about this one. First of all, black people generally don't trust doctors, you know, after the Tuskegee experiments and all that shit. More importantly, don't forget Michael Jackson was killed by a doctor. Granted, he was doing drugs, but if I was a heroin addict and I had a licensed physician injecting heroin in me, I should survive that. I'll just be looking like, \"I'm good, right? I'm good. It's not too much, is it?\" Dr. Butterfingers killed Michael Jackson. After that, that was like, \"Fuck going to the doctor.\" The fuck I get my kids vaccinated for old-ass disease like measles? This is... you might as well give them a diarrhea shot if you're so worried. Diarrhea has a bigger body count than the measles do. You know, diarrhea is funny today, but a hundred years ago, if your ass had diarrhea, you were a goner. There was like a zero chance of survival. You get that first squirt, \"Uh-oh, better start getting my affairs in order. I don't have much time. It's diarrhea. It's very serious.\" I'm just watching buddies slowly die in a pool of his own... \"I give up.\" Diarrhea nowadays, your buddy just... \"We got diarrhea.\" \"Just eat a banana, nigga. Drink some water. Let's get to the club. Still make last call.\n",

            "Tough time for the blacks. These are not good times for the blacks. I don't know if you know what I'm talking about, right? Police are killing us again. Very unfortunate set of circumstances because we were doing very well, you know? America has a racial hot seat, I think we can all agree that that's the truth. And we can also agree that that hot seat is traditionally occupied by African Americans in general, African-American men in particular. Although I can see that in recent years, that seat has been occupied by... by Mexicans and, I dare say, Arabs. And we, the Black Americans, would like to thank you both for your sacrifice and your struggle. We needed a break. We needed a goddamn break. We all go through something, but at least I can leave my backpack someplace. If you are Arab and forget your backpack, you got about 20 minutes before they send that robot to blow your shit up. Afro hot! Now ISIS is number one on the terrorist charts, and ISIS is fucking scary because if ISIS catches you, they're going to cut your head off. That's what they do. I've seen them do it on YouTube. It was fucking awful. He looked right in the camera, \"Obama, I am back!\" I saw that shit, I said, \"Oh my God!\" Don't like... How's this guy cutting people's heads off on YouTube? I can't even post a dick pic, and this motherfucker is decapitating people. I'm gonna have to change my settings. You know, everyone has it hard, but I think harder than Black people, and harder than Arabs, and harder than Mexicans. You know who has it the worst? Fat Black people. It's hard for white people to understand, but that's what I'm saying is very true. Fat Black people have a really rough road because all manner of things kill white people, but you know what kills more Black people than anything? More than police and terrorism? Salt. Regular-ass salt. White people are getting Ebola cures and... and meanwhile, I'm dying from fucking flavoring.\n",

            "Let me say this... Let me just say this. Can we all... can we all just say that we've seen it coming? Were you surprised? It's like when that guy threw that banana at me. Do you think I was surprised? Hell no! I've been in show business 30 years. I was expecting this banana. I knew one of these nights is like, \"Somebody gonna throw a banana at me one of these nights, niggas.\" Because that's how it starts, with the name-calling. Like that Paula Deen, remember Paula Deen? Got fired from the Food Network. If you know anything about show business, it is really hard to get fired from the Food Network. And they dropped that like a hot potato. All because she called somebody an n-word 30 years before she had a show. I don't know who she said it to, but whoever was just looking at her like, \"I'mma get you for this.\" And she came back 30 years later like a Bill Cosby rape and sunk her battleship. And every black person was mad, but we weren't like that mad. I was just like, \"Well, how's this bitch gonna call me a nigga when she told me how to fry chicken?\" That's not fair. I think Donald Sterling was more serious. Remember Donald Sterling? He used to own the Clippers, and then he got caught on a secretly recorded tape saying some very unsavory things about African Americans. And there's a lesson in that for all of us. The lesson is: if you are old and white and racist in this great country, whatever you do, don't tell your black girlfriend about that shit. Because that's who made the tape. She recorded all that shit. And the tape was terrible. He was like, \"Stop bringing these black guys to my games.\" First, we're all confused like, \"Well, how the fuck you gonna have a game without us?\" But it turned out that the black guy he was speaking of was none other than Magic Johnson, the billionaire. Unbelievable. Never even mention the fact that he had AIDS, which is... this guy must be really racist if AIDS is the footnote. \"Yeah, be careful, baby. He got the old Ebola.\" You can say what you want about that girl, but I'm gonna tell you right now, she is a goddamned hero. Because you might have thought these things were happening before, but now you can see it all in front of you without a shadow of a doubt. That actually went down. She sucked that old guy's dick. She really took one for the team on that one. That's really gross. This dick is like 80 years old. It's like tasting history. Like five wars on it. Civil Rights Movement, Great Depression. This guy has been fucking from 40 years before Bill Cosby's first rape. This is a very old man, a very old penis. But all that shit is still... it's just name-calling. It... like name-calling does not break the modern black man. That's not gonna do the trick. I don't give a fuck about that. Like, if I went to Kentucky Fried Chicken, Ku Klux Klan hood on top of their head, what do you think I'm gonna do in this day and age? Right now, I can take a fried chicken. Not if I'm hungry. I'll go straight to the front. \"Hey man, let me get a two-piece.\" I don't give a fuck what he says. \"You want a biscuit with that, nigger?\" \"I thought it came with a biscuit. What's all this attitude? I want a two-piece. Chop chop!\" You know what it is? But I'm not gonna be mad. Why would I be mad? He's the one that's gotta work at Kentucky Fried Chicken, not me.\n",

            "Yeah, tough time for the blacks. I'm not gonna say nothing about the police. I'll leave that for Chris Rock. The other big sports story was fucking Ray Rice's tape. Anyone see that Ray Rice tape? I can't stop watching it. It's fucking awful. That's the most violent thing I've seen happen to a woman that was shot in color. Really fucking bad. Like, if I could have froze time at that moment and gave Ray Rice some advice, I don't think there's any way possible I'd be like, \"You should punch her in the face.\" It's a fucking terrible idea. In the same time, I also believe she shouldn't have rushed him. What the fuck was he like? You can't beat him, miss. Don't rush a motha-fucker that's trained to stiff-arm people in the clutch. He's going to get the upper hand. Only reason I bring him up is because, you know, he's about to play football again. You didn't know that? The NFL was told by a federal judge they had to reinstate Ray Rice because he was transparent with the investigation. He told them exactly what he did, and they can't just change your verdict. That's like if I'm hanging out with my buddies and I'm like, \"Hey guys, guess what I did last night? I fucked this big fat girl I met at the club,\" and they all like, \"Oh shit, Dave, that's crazy.\" And then they see a tape of me doing it and they're like, \"We can't hang out with you anymore, Dave. That's not what this crew is all about.\" I'd be like, \"What? I told y'all what I did!\" What's really fucked up was the tape was made before they were married. Isn't that weird? I don't know why she'd do that. I don't even know why he would do that. As a guy, would you want to live with the woman that you had once punched in the face with all your strength? And some very bold, \"Color Purple\" type shit. \"Silly, come out here and shave me.\" You out of your fucking mind? I had to ask an older friend of mine just to get some perspective. Older black dude, actually the fairest person I've ever met. And I asked him, I just... I just said, \"Hey man, I said, did you see that Ray Rice video?\" And instantly he was like, \"David, that shit was disgusting.\" I wonder what she said to him. I don't think that matters. I think the idea is you're not supposed to punch her in the face. My wife says terrible shit to me. My wife once called me a pussy in front of dinner guests. I know... I started to get mad, but then I was like, \"Fuck it, she's probably right. I am a pussy.\" I admit it. I'm soft and warm and persuasive like a real pussy. Right? And then I told... I said, \"And if you don't take care of me properly, I might stink like your pussy.\" Oh, we fight dirty in the Chappelle household. It's not a big deal.\n",

Now, actually, there's two women that I know that both college professors in this little area I live in, and I meet them twice a week at Starbucks for coffee, talk about important... and I asked the girls, \"Who's Ray Rice?\" after he punched her in the face with all his strength. And one of my girlfriends said, \"David, you need to wake the fuck up. She's staying for the money.\" Well, now wait a minute, because my other girlfriend was like, \"I disagree. I think that she actually loves him.\" And I said, \"Wait a minute, ladies. You know what? I think that you're both right.\" And what I was doing when I said that was preserving the possibility of a threesome with these bitches.

He said, \"I did it because Dave Chappelle is racist.\" So, nigga, that's not the best way to handle that.

            "Is the word \"pussy\" offensive? All right, just checking. Just checking. I asked that crowd when I was in Denver. I said, \"Is the word-\" People... One was a woman in the front, older than me, maybe around my age. Definitely a feminist, you know what I mean? Short haircut, plaid shirt, you know what I'm saying. And she didn't say it offended her. What she said, and she said, \"I'm uncomfortable with that word.\" And I was like, \"Really? You...\" And then before I could ask her why, there was one other guy. He was in the balcony. Now, I don't think he was saying this to me, but he said this. Everybody heard him. Said he goes, \"It's delicious!\" I don't think I've ever heard pussy called delicious before in my life. Now, this is not to say that's bad, but it's definitely an acquired taste. I don't think any of us taste pussy our first time like, \"Hey, it's good! It needs something.\" You know, it's illegal for a gynecologist to say the word \"pussy.\" They can only say \"vagina,\" or they can name individual parts medically, but they can never say shorthand. Even if the gynecologist is a woman! I feel like... It was a woman. I don't think men should be allowed to be gynecologists. That shit is a conflict of interest. Even when my wife was pregnant, we used to go to a gynecologist, and he put her legs up in that stirrup like this. He'd be like, \"All right, Miss Chappelle, just try to relax.\" I push his back up. \"Motherfucker, I got this. Just tell me what to look for.\" One of those home-style checkups. There's too many ethical questions when men do that. Like, can a gynecologist lose their license for smelling their fingers during an exam? Is that... is that illegal? How could they not? These are men! It's like if you have a good barbecue, you don't even think about it. You just *licks fingers*.\n",

            "The word \"pussy\" is only offensive if you're older. People my age and younger, I don't think we even... We danced to that... that song come on the radio said, \"I beat the pussy up.\" That's our song. It's like nothing like a love song. There's no \"Tracks of My Tears,\" no \"Midnight Train to Georgia.\" This man simply beats the pussy up. Unbelievable. You don't even know if he's having sex with these women. They might just pull their pants down, he'd be like, \"G-Unit!\" Like you'll be watching HBO: \"Hi, I'm Larry Merchant standing here ringside with the pussy after a devastating bout with 50 Cent. Pussy, come over here and let me talk to you for a second. My God, you look terrible. Your lips seem to be swollen, you're bleeding a little bit. Tell me, pussy, what happened inside of that ring with 50?\" \"I don't know, Larry. I felt really good in the first round. I was ready to fight. It's warm and moist, and um... I don't know, he just hit me from angles I wasn't expecting. The front, left, back, side surprised me the most.\" \"Well, pussy, let's take a look at round four. This is where it all went wrong for you. Here you come out of your corner, pussy. You fight really good. It looks like you got 50 with a right and left, but then 50 slips your jab in there. There, right there, you see that? He punches you right on that um... that little bean thing you have on the top of your head. I don't know what that is, but there's 50 just pounding away at that bean over and over.\" \"And that pudding gets rattled around like that. I don't think I was thinking anything, Larry. You know, I'm a real good defensive fighter. It's real hard to get to me, uh... I've never been punched directly on my bean before. As a matter of fact, most fighters don't even know that bean exists. I guess he just hit me, then I lost control of my legs. I don't know what else to tell you.\" I like when Lil Wayne talks about pussy because he is little. White man, Lil Wayne... That song he say, \"I got a big shit, plays movies in my jacuzzi,\" and it goes like this, \"But is it juicy?\" That... that always makes me laugh because there's no guy says that. You know, only a Lil Wayne will say some shit like that. If he was like, \"Yo, is this pussy good?\" \"It's juicy.\" \"It's good juice!\" That's why I'm not Lil Wayne, because if I was in a hot tub with a girl and I could tell that the pussy was juicy while I was in the hot tub, I'd probably get out of the tub. I'm a germaphobe. I just pushed a little Wayne like, \"What is this strange oil floating in my hot tub water?\" \"Juice!\" Actually, it was so funny to me, I must have wrote like no less than 40 jokes with the punchline \"juice,\" and all of them work to some degree, 100% of the time. I'll do one more just so you believe me, okay? All right, in this next piece, it's a special episode of CSI. For some reason, Lil Wayne's guest-starring as the lead detective. Okay? That's the setup. Are you ready? Here it goes: \"Has anyone else been on this crime scene?\" \"No, it's very strange. This place is virtually undisturbed. No forced entry, no sign of a struggle.\" *Shining a flashlight* \"Right here... just stepped on something. What is this? What is this? It glistens in the light, smooth to the touch...\" \"Pussy juice. She must have been sitting Indian style.\"\n",

            "Mischaracterizing my jokes, trying to make a point off of me when it was really... It's like, \"Yo, I'm your ally, fucking... I'm not trying to stop gay people. I got better to do.\" This was saying things to try to get gay people to beat me up. Seriously, he was like... Dave Chappelle's jokes—I don't know how he actually talks, I'm making his voice up—\"David Chappelle's jokes were an affront to the manhood of all gay men.\" What the... does that mean? I didn't say anything that would allude to gay men not being men. I know you're men. In fact, what could be manlier than fucking another guy in the ass? It's the most gangster shit I've ever heard of in my life. I told you, I'm not cut out for that. I'm a pussy, you know what I said? That's all I said. First of all, I'll tell you right now what I said, uh, and I will tell you that this was not a joke. It's a true story and I just happened to tell it. All right, what happened was I went to a gallery party. All right? I don't know who in here has ever been rich before, but these are very nice parties, uh, you know, wine and cheese and ball of conversation. And there was a few eccentric types, one of which was a very wealthy man that happened to be wearing a dress. I don't know what you call... maybe this is a... or drag queen perhaps, whatever it was. Is definitely a man, and this man was definitely on drugs. I don't know what kind of drugs he's on, but I knew he had too much. He didn't look good. It's like this, he's like... he looks sick and all his friends were standing around him concerned, trying to revive him. I don't know whether he... looked like some kind of gay CPR, those fanning and shit. I saw all this from a distance. Now, I should have minded my own business, but I got curious. I was like... and I went over there. All I said, I said, \"Excuse me, gentlemen... gentlemen, is he okay?\" And then they looked at me like I was evil. \"She is fine.\" I'm sorry, to know... this is what we were doing. Um, here's my thing: I support anybody's right to be whoever they feel like they are inside. I mean... ally in that. However, my question is: to what degree do I have to participate in your self-image? Is it fair that I have to change my whole pronoun game up for this mother-fucker? That didn't make sense. Seriously, if I put on an argyle sweater and I'm like, \"Hey everybody, I feel like a white guy in the sweater and I want some goddamn respect in a bank loan,\" it's not gonna work. Give a fuck how I feel, why should I care how you feel? N*gger is a pronoun. But there was no time for philosophical debate. This was an emergency situation. I said, \"Fine, sorry guys. I was just worried because... because she looks terrible. She just fell off the bench. Appears that her dick is popping out of her dress.\" No matter if I call an ambulance, champ. I'd rather not be at a party where a tranny OD. There's too many questions to answer.\n",

            "I fucking hate bloggers. I'm not saying it because this person was gay. They was acting like a bitch online. It was like... okay, I've been through this before. I had a friend from high school. Now in high school, this guy was a thug, wheel right? He was a fucking dope boy. He did it all. He's a wild dude. People used to be very scared of him. And then after high school, word on the street was he'd come out the closet. I personally didn't believe it. I bring him up because last year he calls me out of the blue like, \"Yo, what's up man? I got your number from so-and-so, and I heard you gonna be in New York doing a show. Could I get some tickets?\" I was like, \"Yeah, get some tickets man. How you been?\" He said, \"Well, we'll catch up at the show man, but yo, I appreciate it. I'll see you soon.\" I said, \"All right man, take care.\" And I was about to hang up and I couldn't resist. I was just like, \"Hey n*gga, I heard you was gay. What's going on with that?\" And I wish I didn't ask because he sounded like he was dying to talk about that shit, and he had a long story about it. And it's not that I didn't care, but I was, you know... I don't like talking on the phone. I was watching TV at the same time, so I just wasn't really paying attention like I should. But I was trying to sound supportive. I didn't really know what to say, so I just like mumbling throughout this conversation. I just like, \"Oh, you know, you gay man. You just gay.\" This went on for a while, and then finally I had to say something like definitive to get him off the phone. And I was like, \"Hey man, you know what? Don't let people get you down, all right? And uh, the next time someone tries to make you feel bad about yourself, just remember everybody fucks funny to somebody.\" He didn't like that shit. He's like, \"What the fuck does that mean?\" I said, \"Huh?\" \"You saying I fuck funny?\" I said, \"No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying everybody's different.\" He said, \"You ain't say different. You said... you said funny. What's so fucking funny about the way I fuck?\" And I said, \"Hey man, I fuck feet.\" He said, \"What?\" Oh, this is not a joke, ladies and gentlemen. I get women to squeeze their feet together like this and I fuck them right in that little space in their feet. But you can't build a community behind that shit. There's no flag for us. That made him laugh. The next day after the show, I saw him backstage. He was like, \"Yo, what's up man?\" I'm like, \"Oh, what's going on?\" And he had his buddy with him. He goes, \"Dave, this is my man. Well man, where's my fiancé? We're in New York getting married because it's legal here.\" I said, \"Oh... oh well, uh, that's... yes.\" And he went to go get some drinks, and then my buddy looked at me. He was like, \"So Dave, what do you think?\" And I started mumbling again. \"Hey, you know, just gay n*gga.\" He's like, \"I'm a little nervous about getting married man. It's a big step.\" So I said, \"Yeah, it is big step.\" He said, \"Well, you've been married for a while. You got any advice for us?\" \"No, I'm married to a woman.\" \"Sorry about that.\" And then corrected me. He said, \"No, you married the person that you love, so it's essentially the same.\" I said, \"You know man, uh, the problem with that statement is that it makes the assumption that I love my wife.\" But you guys, lighten the fuck up. Of course I love my wife. She laughs at this shit. As a matter of fact, she eats and spits this shit. You know what I told him? I told... I told him, I said, \"You know what you should do, man? First of all, you shouldn't do it. Uh, I'm talking about being legally married. It's not that you're gay as much as just legal marriage is a fucking diabolical leverage game in the United States.\" I'm just being honest. Devoid of religious significance or the idea of love, marriage is nothing but an awful contract that you shouldn't sign. Just being real. Because you start out loving each other, and then like two years later, you're just building a case against one another for a hypothetical court date that may or may not ever happen. You know, being gay on top of that? That shit is explosive. Like I said, Ray Rice shit, okay? Right after Ray Rice went through all that, I was at a party and I met this kid Michael Sam. You know Michael Sam? Very nice guy. He's the first openly gay NFL player. And Mike was a very nice guy, very brave guy, but when I met him, I couldn't help but thinking, \"His wife up in the elevator... is that domestic violence or is that just two n*ggas working shit out in the elevator?\" You know what I mean?\n",

            "I give all married men the same advice, gay or straight: get a dog. This dog will love you all the time, but she's not going to... It was real talk. I didn't even... I didn't even know about dogs, and my kids got the dog. They brought them home from the shelter and I didn't even want it. They were like, \"Can we keep them?\" I said, \"Nope.\" I said, \"Where'd you even get this dog?\" \"We got him from the shelter.\" I was like, \"Uh, probably something wrong with them. Can't keep them.\" And then my kids started crying and screaming like the dog had gambling debts. \"Please dad, if you don't let us keep them, they're gonna kill them!\" \"All right, you can keep him.\" And his dog was a menace. I hated his guts. Then one night I smoked a bunch of weed and I was eating a sandwich and staring at me. This will make you very uncomfortable if you're just looking at you. I had to give him a piece of my sandwich so he'd go away. And that's how we became friends. Now if you see me walking down the street with Baba, I ain't got no leash or nothing. He walks right next to me. If I... if I stop, he'll stop, and if I go, he'll go. And all my friends like, \"Yo Dave, that shit is dope. How you training Baba to do that shit?\" Hmm. I've never trained Baba. Just a messy eater. If I drop food and Baba's not around, all I gotta do is call him. \"Baba!\" He's a black dude's dog so they didn't come right away. He peeks first to see what's going on. I gotta tap my foot so we can see the food over here. \"Little buddy.\" And he's like, \"Thanks David.\" He'll come get it and run off. But he knows all my habits. Like if he smells weed in the house, he'll be like, \"This motherfucker's about to eat,\" and I'll just come running. Baba got me through a very difficult time in my marriage. We spend the most time together. Like it's not that me and my wife don't spend time together, but we've been married so long it's like we don't... we don't talk. Like I don't know, anyone's married here, but if after 10 years, all that chatty shit goes away. You've said it all, you know what I mean? Yeah, we're just in the zone. She says the same shit to me every night before she goes to bed. I'll be the last one up. She's like, \"Let me get some sleep, Dave. Good night.\" \"All right baby, we'll stay and watch television. Good night.\" And she'll walk halfway up the steps. \"David?\" \"Huh?\" \"Don't eat the kid's lunch.\" And then she walks away. Well, the crazy shit is I don't even eat their lunch anymore. In the day, I used to eat that shit. You know how that goes. I might smoke some weed in the middle of the night and she'll leave neatly wrapped sandwiches all over the kitchen. I'm going to eat it. What's the big deal? Why can't you just make another one in the morning? I mean, it's like... I got sons anyway. My sons live everything that dads do. My kids would be in school the next day just look like, \"Oh, dad bit my sandwich.\" \"Oh, you could trade that sandwich for something better. What I'm doing is adding value to their lunch.\" She doesn't understand these types of things.\n",

I tore the whole house apart trying to find the VCR. I hadn't seen the tape in like over a decade. And I watched the tape and it was awful. They got me. It was a tape of me... I was fucking a girl, okay? But it was from before I was married. But it's not a good look, and I felt sick to my stomach. And I looked up at the clock and then I saw my wife was coming home in 10 minutes, and I just panicked. I... I jerked off to the tape real fast and then... and then I called the FBI. Much better. I mean, they didn't say they were going to catch them for sure, but they had the demeanor of some competent people that would catch them. So I didn't worry about it too much. And then not even a week later, five days later, I come home and there's another video cassette just sitting on my porch. As soon as I saw it, I just called the police like, \"They've done it again. Uh, you should probably look for a guy with bell bottoms on because I don't know who the fuck is sending tapes.\" *yells* And that second tape was the worst shit I'd ever seen in my life. It was awful. Career ending bad. It was a tape of me jerking off to the tape a week earlier. I don't even know how... how even get such a thing. I had to explain all of this to my wife. She was very mad. No thing in this world is as cold as a woman's cold shoulder because she was mad, but she wouldn't talk to me about it. She would just punish me in little ways. Make me do shit that I hate to do, like pick the kids up from school. That's one thing that's a hardship for me.\n",

            "I got one son that goes to a public school and her brother goes to a private school. It's an experiment. I just want to see what's going to happen to him. But what's weird is my little son in private school, he's like my... he's like my thuggy son, you know what I mean? I don't know where he'd get that from. He's not getting it from me, and he's definitely not getting from that school. This school is very like... it's a liberal school. It's the kind of school there might be like 12 black students in the entire school, and I'm the only black parent. And none of the parents like me either. Not because I'm black, but just like they don't like... I rule because I've been showing up late all the time, and I'm like in a Porsche and a blast in music that they don't like. Music \"I beat the pussy up,\" and I pull into the parking lot. I might be smoking a cigarette with the kids in the car. Then I pull in like that handicap space, and then when I get out of the handicapped space, they always want to say some passive aggressive shit. \"Morning Dave. Uh, I don't know if you noticed, but he actually parked in the handicapped space.\" \"Huh? Yeah, you know what, Frank? I did notice. Uh, but who's this handicapped guy we're all waiting on that never shows up?\" So I hate going over to that school. The only... only parents that are nice to me is a lesbian couple, Kate and Sarah. Actually, Kate hates my guts. Sarah knows that I'm black and she's half black, so she just understands me, you know what I'm saying? I can't explain it because I'll say shit and Kate's just too serious about being a lesbian. I'd be like, \"Hey Kate, hey Sarah. Uh, you guys going to the father-son picnic next week? How's that going to work?\" And Kate will instantly be furious, but Sarah knows I'm fucking around, so she'll just say something cool. \"I don't know Dave, maybe me and Kate will flip for that shit.\" I said, \"Bitch, you better save that coin toss because everybody knows you strapping onto that household.\" And then Kate'll turned bright red, but Sarah just fist bumped me like, \"You right, n*gga.\" It's me. We're good friends. We're good friends. They invite me to stuff. They're like my only friends at school.So imagine my surprise when I go to pick my son up after all this happens and uh, the teacher is waiting outside for me. She's just standing right there in the middle of the fucking handicap space. I knew something was wrong. So I rolled the... \"We need to talk to you for a minute in the office.\" I said, \"No, fuck that. We gotta talk right here. What's going on?\" And it was bad. Ibrahim had a fight. I said, \"A fight?\" \"Don't worry, everyone's okay.\" I said, \"Everyone? What happened?\" \"Well, that's it. We don't know what happened because he won't talk to anybody. All we know is that he punched Sarah Jr. in the face.\" I said, \"Oh no. Sarah's one of the only parents I'm not sure I can beat up in this school.\" Just then Kate and Sarah pulled up to pick up their daughter, and then we all had to go into the office. And I was really worried. I didn't want them to kick me out of the school. And then they brought my son and he was crying. They brought him in like a prisoner. He was like, \"Oh... oh...\" I said, \"Son, just stop crying. Calm down. Do not look at these mean faces. I need you to look at my face and I need you to tell me the truth, buddy. All right? Just tell me the truth. Is it true? Did you punch that girl Sarah Junior in the face?\" I was trying to give him a signal to lie, but he didn't pick up on it. I was like... he wasn't paying attention. \"I punched her face.\" \"Oh my God! Why? Why would you do that? You're not supposed to put your hand on anyone.\" He was so gangsta, it scared all the parents in the room. He was like, \"Oh, because she had it coming.\" And everyone looked at me. I said, \"I did not teach you... I don't know where he got that from.\" I said, \"What does that mean? That is crazy talk. What does that mean?\" And then he just started crying like he was Tupac. \"These kids keep fucking with meeeee!\" I told his teacher, I said, \"Well... well now wait a minute. This is a lot of things, but he's not a liar. And if he said they was fucking with him, they did something to him. Son, what's going on? What did they do to you?\" \"Oh, damn tired of this shit. It's been going on all week.\" I said, \"What's going on all week?\" He said, \"I was at lunch and that bitch bit my sandwich.\" I said, \"This is the fourth time this week. I'm tired of sandwich biting. Stop using that word. Let's go home.\" That's a quiet car ride home. We got the house, he just ran right up to his room, slammed the door. His mother came downstairs by then. She had heard about everything. She was looking at me like, \"Oh my God.\" She said, \"You bit that goddamn sandwich, didn't you Dave?\" I said, \"I'm tired of you accusing me of shit,\" and I just ran out of the house, jumped in my car and drove off. Of course I bit that sandwich, but I know that she was just really mad about that tape. So now she's going to punish me about a fucking sandwich I bit. That was... man, that's... you know what I said to myself? I said, \"I should just never go home.\" This... you know, by the way, that's how people used to get divorced in the 40s. When a divorce court in America... back in those days, if you want to get out your marriage, you should tell your wife, \"Hey baby, I'm going to get a pack of cigarettes. I'll be right back.\" We will just leave with the clothes on your back. That's when men were men. And there was no internet back then, so you could move 11 miles away and have a whole new life.\n",

            "I ended up going back home late at night and came in the room, and she was actually changing for bed. You can always tell your wife is mad at you when they cover their titties up when you're walking... \"Oh, let those titties out. It's me, baby. Can we just talk about this for a minute?\" She said, \"David, there's nothing to talk about. I already know you bit the sandwich, and don't go looking for the lunch. I hid it.\" I said, \"I don't want to talk about this sandwich, baby. I want to talk about... the tape. I know that's why you're mad.\" It was very difficult conversation. I had to crack a few jokes, and we started talking, and then she cracked a few jokes that hurt my feelings, honestly. But when we talk, you know what she told me? She told me that she was madder about the second extortion tape than she was about the first one, which doesn't make sense at all. What's wrong with a guy touching his own private parts? It's my own business. It's not like I do it all the time. As a matter of fact, sometimes I do it for her benefit. A lot of guys do this. It's called the mercy jerk. That's the one that happens in the middle of the night when you're about to roll on top of her, and you see her face, and you're like, \"She looks tired.\" That takes a lot of love and discipline to back out of a room with a rock hard dick. Sometimes I don't make it. \"Uh-oh, someone fell asleep with the socks off, didn't they?\" You can't rape feet. You can't rape feet. All the time I jerk off... \"Nails in the game.\" Sometimes she'll tell me, \"Dave, I'm gonna take the kid to my mom real quick. Uh, probably back in a couple of hours.\" A couple hours? You can get a good one in in two hours. That's the kind of session where you'll take all your clothes off. I'll be butt naked in the living room like, \"Get these toys out of my way.\" Disgusting foot all on the coffee table, just stroking it out, taking my time. And I got a bowl of cereal waiting for me right here. That's when you have the privacy. You can have a loud orgasm. I miss those. \"Ah!\" You know, when a guy busts a nut, like right after that, there's a window of like six minutes where he does the most rational thing he ever does. That's when he's always horrified. \"Oh God, what have I done? Oh my God, it's everywhere!\"\n",

            "I'm gonna tell you something right now, man. Fat girls... fat girls... I love them. I do love them, but they're killing us all. They're killing our planet. They are literally killing us with their fat. It's like... it's like a virus, man! It's a virus! It starts off small, and then it gets big, and before you know it, you're dead. And the saddest part about it is that most of these women don't even realize they're fat. You know? Because they're always looking at other people like, \"Oh, she's so fat.\" She ain't fat compared to me, man!\n",
            "I'll tell you what I did one time when I was dating a girl. We were having dinner together, and we got into an argument. She said something that I didn't agree with, and I just sat there and looked at her. I just stared at her for five minutes. Five whole minutes, man, I stared at this woman. And finally, she said, \"What?\" I said, uh, \"You're fat.\" And she started crying. Now, I had never seen her cry before. So I thought maybe I hurt her feelings. I tried to console her. But she wouldn't stop crying. She just kept crying and crying. And then after about 10 minutes, she stopped crying. Then she looked up at me, and she said this: \"I am not fat!\" And I said to myself, \"Damn, I hit a nerve.\"\n",
            "But I had to say something, man... I had no choice. I said... I said this, and it worked. I saved the relationship. I turned around and I said very calmly, \"Well, I guess I must be ugly, because I can't get any pussy.\" And that shut her down, man.\n",
            "And then the next day, we went out to eat again, and the waitress brought the food. And I could see my girlfriend's eyes getting bigger and bigger and wider and wider. She couldn't take it. She had to ask the waitress, \"Is this a large order?\"\n",
            "And the waitress looked at us like, 'Man, I don't know.' So she walked away. My girlfriend picked up the fork, and right when she was about to put the first bite in her mouth, I grabbed her hand. I held her hand up. I looked at the fork. I shook my head. I let go of her hand, and my girlfriend looked at me. She looked at herself. She dropped the fork back on the plate. She pushed the plate across the table, and this is what she said: \"We need to talk.\"\n",
            "I knew we were going to break up. All right, so I told her... I told my girlfriend, \"Look, baby, if you're gonna leave me, please don't make it hard on me. Just tell me straight up. If you're leaving me, just say, 'Dave, I'm leaving you.' Don't drag it out. Don't start making excuses. Don’t start telling me you have to go to work early. That shit's not fair. You gotta give me a chance to respond, man!\"\n",
            "So she looked at my face, and by the look on my face... I think she realized I wasn't joking. She didn't want to break it off. She was trying to figure out some way to keep me. And she came up with this crazy idea. She pulled out her phone. She opened Google Maps. She zoomed in on the restaurant we were sitting in. And here's what she showed me: \"See this little red dot? That's us.\" And then she pressed a button on the screen, and here's the message that popped up: \"You are here.\"\n",
            "She said, 'David, I saw that we're in the middle of nowhere. What if we just stay here tonight?' I said 'All right.'\n",
            "So we stayed there. And that night, we had sex for the first time. And it was good, man… really good. I mean, it was... it was great. It was like a revelation. And after we finished, we lay there talking. And we were talking about our lives, and stuff. And you know, we were both thinking about how much better life would be if we weren't fat. So we decided to get in shape together. And yeah, we did. We lost weight. We ran marathons. We became models. We made millions of dollars. It all happened. And everything was perfect until one day, my wife called me from the grocery store. She sounded panicked. She called me on the phone, and said, “David, come quick!” I said ‘What’s wrong?’ She said, ‘It’s the cookies!’ I said what about the cookies? She said 'They’re calling my name!' And that's when I knew. She's fat again. And since then, every time I've seen her, I can see it. Her eyes are getting bigger. Every time she eats, she gets fatter. I can feel it. And now I'm afraid. Afraid that she's gonna die. I don’t know what to do. I try to help her, but she won't listen. I'm tired of arguing. I haven't been able to sleep. I wake up every morning, and... and I check the mirror. I check my stomach. I press my fingers against my belly. I push down real hard, and if I can still feel my ribs, I know I'm okay. But if I don'... if I feel my gut pushing back at me... I panic. I freak out. I run downstairs. I jump in my car. I drive to the nearest fast-food restaurant. I park my car, and immediately, I start eating. I eat three double cheeseburgers, two orders of fries, and four Big Gulps. And while I'm eating, I’m watching myself in the rearview mirror. And if I see myself gaining weight, I'll order another burger. I'll drink another soda. I’ll order another fry. I will not stop until I can actually see my rib cage again. I gotta get back in shape. I have to save my marriage. This is serious. I cannot lose my wife over a cookie.\n",
