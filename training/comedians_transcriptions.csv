Mark Normand,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v69-181zzk8,"- Ladies and gentlemen, please
give it up for Mark Normand! - Hey, hey. Comedy, huh? We're really doing it folks. Thanks for coming out. Good to be here. Hey, how you doing? Nice to see you. Hey, good shirt. How are you? Cleavage, that's exciting. Ah, hey, don't get
weird, you brought it. All right, here we are. Sorry, I gotta work on saying
things to people out loud. Yeah, I got a problem,
I just say what I see. I think I'm autistic, but just like the bad
parts of it, you know? Like I can't compute
numbers or remember dates, but I'll make you feel weird. Like, you drop a bunch of
toothpicks, I can't count 'em, but I'll give you a shitty hug. I'm working on it,
trying to get better. Flew here from New York. Man, I hate flying. You know, they let you
pick your seat on a plane. I think I'd rather pick the
person I'm sitting next to. I don't really give a shit
where I am on the plane. It's like a five-hour
relationship. Make it more like a dating app. Obese Nazi with a service dog. Swipe left. Tiny Asian lady with
a surgical mask. That's my gal. Yes, she is not a talker, right? But just like a dating app,
she shows up with a baby. I'm like I got catfished. Hate the small talk. Two things I can't do,
small talk and eye contact. How sad is that, you know? I basically have all the
traits of a serial killer, just without the ambition. I'm working on it. People always say, ""Mark,
you gotta be more confident."" They say, ""Mark,
gotta be yourself."" I'm like, well,
you gotta pick one. I can't do both of those. Like a lot of people
are scared of skydiving. I'm more scared of the
banter on the plane than I am jumping
out of it, you know? You sit in the plane, it's
all windy, you're strapped in. Some guy's like, so
Mark, where you from? Just like... It's like, we're
supposed to go together. I got it. At least with skydiving,
you get an instructor. What about stuff I'm bad
at, stuff I'm nervous about, like a dinner party? You know how many dinner
parts I've screwed up? Set me up with a pro, right? I just show up. Some guy's like, all right,
I'll take care of him. Like, oh, beautiful,
he's giving me tips. Don't say the N word. Got it, all right. She's not pregnant, don't ask. Thank God you're here, right? Some guy at the party's like,
so, who's your favorite comic? I'm like, Bill Cosby. He's like, pull the shoot. I'm working on it. I had a chatty Uber
driver last week. That's the worst, huh? This guy wouldn't shut up. I forgot the no small
talk option on the app so I had to get creative. I had to scare the
guy into being quiet. He's like, how about
this traffic, huh? What do you think's
causing this? I'm like, probably the Jews. He's like. I'm like, all right. I give this ride
five stars of David. I'm working on it, you know. Always trying to get better. I'm a weirdo,
that's why I drink. Big fan of the booze,
I gotta cut back. I actually got let
go from a job once for being drunk at work. My boss called me and he
goes, get in here, Mark. It's clear you're a
high-functioning alcoholic. I was like, how, how do
you know I was also high? This guy is good. One of my friends is like
a beer expert, you know? He's like, we gotta
go to a brewery. I'm like, why can't
we just go to a bar? He's like, it's fun, you
can see how it's made. I don't care how it's made. Look, I like porn, I don't
need to go to a broken home. Not saying all porn stars
are from broken homes. Just the ones I like. Seems like a lot of people
are quitting the booze now. It's kind of going away. All my friends are getting
sober and look, that's good, but some people are better
when they're drinking. There's a lot of bad
sobers out there, you know? We always talk about the
negative part about booze. What about the good? Like, sure you drove
through a playground, but you could
dance man, come on. Trying to get better,
I'm in therapy. Anybody else? Hey, there you go. Couple people, yeah. Yeah, I'm doing this thing
called exposure therapy. That's where you
face your fears. Scared of heights,
take a hot air balloon. Scared of drowning,
takes you in the ocean. So he said, what are
you scared of, Mark? I said, I'm claustrophobic
and scared of intimacy. So he took me in a little
closet and fucked me. That was very expensive. Yeah, why the
stigma with therapy? Why, all my friends
make fun of me. I think it should be mandatory. Everybody works
out their muscles. Why not work out your emotions? I'll be hanging out
with a friend, he's
like, all right man, take it easy, I'm gonna
go work on arms and back. I'm like, cool. I'm gonna go work on letting go of the past and accepting love. Okay everybody loves the gym. Oo, the gym makes me feel sexy. Well, you know
what else is sexy? Not being a walking red flag. Nobody cares about your abs if you're the guy having a
meltdown at Chili's, right? I think people respect the gym 'cause there's a
culture behind it. You know, like gym rats. They have t-shirts
that say beast mode and better sore than sorry. Therapy people,
we need T-shirts. We need a shirt that
says, no dad, no problem. Right, they're like, can't
stop won't stop crying. I could have used
some therapy as a kid, weird kid, bed wetter. Oh yeah, I wet the bed every
day till I was 13 years old. My mattress looked like
a goddamn coffee filter. Wooee I ruined a lot of
sleepovers folks, yep. You start to run out of
excuses after a while. Now your friend's like,
what happened here? I was like, ha geez, I must
have spilled a cup of piss. Yeah they say a lot of bed
wetters become serial killers, which I believe 'cause we learn how to clean up a
stain pretty quick. That's how embarrassing
it is wetting the bed. Almost rather be known as a
murderer than a bed wetter. You know, your friend
sits on your mattress. Why is it all crinkly? I'm gonna kill you. But hey, growing up
now, 36 years old. I grew up before the internet. Maybe a better time for a kid. Maybe a question back then. Hey mom, what's a
capitol of South Dakota? She's like, I'm on the phone. And you just didn't know. What a concept, not knowing. Now we have so much
information right there. Now I have an Alexa,
I love this thing, and Alexa's like a mom without
the passive aggressiveness. Ask anything you want. Hey Alexa, how many
cups in a liter? 4.23 cups. All right. If I'm like, hey mom,
how many cups in a liter? She's like, why don't
you check your mattress? Zing. That Alexa is tricky. I read an article recently. It said, Alexa actually
listens to everything you say. Stores it in a database, could
use it against you later. I was like damn, just
like a real woman. Now I'm all nervous,
like, Hey Alexa, what's the weather out there? She's like, why
don't you ask Siri? Oh boy, here we go. Yeah, it's gotta be
hard to be a kid now. I feel bad for kids. So much stimulus coming at kids. iPhone, internet, social media. Remember how happy go
lucky we were as kids, not a care in the world. Maybe running to
the car, shotgun. That was like the biggest
problem in my life, shotgun. Yeah, I never see kids
doing that anymore. The only time a kid yells it
out now is in a classroom. Whoa, whoa, whoa
school shootings. What a bummer, huh? Ah, the great American pastime. Yeah, school shootings are like
the Menstruation of America. Happens about once a
month, it's bloody, and every kid goes, well,
I guess it's my turn now. Aww, I know they're bad. I like how they're
blaming the video games. Video games cause violence. Come on, video games
don't cause violence. Video games cause carpal
tunnel and vaginal dryness. I know a lot of guys, they play eight hours
of video games a day. Their girlfriends
are like, violent. Slap my ass, choke me. I'm dying here. Look, I don't think games
translate to real life. I grew up playing
Monopoly with my friends. None of them now own property. To be fair, some did go
directly to jail, yeah. That's we got problems here, you know, like I just
got back from Europe. They really make fun
of us over there. That's like all they do. ""Oh, you Americans,
you're so fat."" I'm like, ""Hey, yeah,
we're doing great."" Why is that a bad
thing how fat we are? I think it's cool,
it's like impressive. More people die in America
of obesity than starvation. Which is like, hey, we did it. How cool are we, we're
dying from eating, food. We go up to heaven,
some guy's like, ""I starved to death,
what happened to you?"" We're like ""Snacks."" Yeah, the McRib is
back, what do you want? He said well how'd you
lose your foot frostbite? Nah, frosting. Yeah, we're fat. We're so high up
on the food chain. One of my friends, he
only eats grass fed beef. You realize how crazy that is. That means he gets to
pick what he eats, eats. That's pretty good. And here's the weird
thing, cows eat grass. That's how much we
mess with our food. When something eats what it's
supposed to, we brag about it. That's like saying, hey, no,
my four year old is sober. Get the hell outta here. Father of the year over here. Yeah, we're fat. All my friends are fat, mostly. My family's fat. I grew up pretty fat, you know. I try not to make
fun of fat people unless they make fun of me. That's when I let
it go, you know? Like all my fat
friends give me shit. One of my fat friends told
me I have skinny privilege. Like privilege something
can't be a privilege if you could do it too. Right, I've known
you my whole life. You used to be thin. Privileges can't be attained
by exercising, right? If that were the case, then black people would
take a jazzercize class, they wouldn't get pulled over. It'd be that simple. He always condescends to me, oh, you're so lucky you're thin. Lucky, you gotta work at it. It's hard. What the hell? You gotta eat, right. It sucks. Saying you're so
lucky you're thin is like saying you're so
lucky you don't have kids. No, no, I had food
and I pulled out. He's like, whatever,
it's easy being skinny. Well, not really,
you couldn't do it. Ah yeah. I read a news article
about obesity. They said they're thinking
about putting microchips in obese people's brains. It shocks 'em every time
they think about food. I was like, if we have
that kind of technology, I feel like we should be
using that on pedophiles. Why are we wasting
that on chubs? I don't care about
your candy intake. I'm worried about
your candy output. Priorities, people. Eat all the cupcakes you want, just don't touch Little Debbie. Ah, pedophilia, huh? Any pedophiles here? I mean, statistically,
there's gotta be two, right? But hey, we're all adults here, which is a sentence they hate. You guys ever get
down your knees and thank God you're
not a pedophile? They didn't choose that,
they got dealt a bad hand. We're extremely lucky. We should be grateful. Think about how
close we all were. When I was in third grade, I was attracted to
third grade girls. Now I like adult women. When I was in third
grade, I like grape juice. Now I like red wine, but
I still like grape juice. Holy hell, that was close. Thank God my brain just
knew the right way to go. Woo. I just watched a documentary
on Pedophilia with my friend. My friend goes, ooh, I could
never have sex with a kid. They're so annoying. I was like, that's it, huh? That's the thing that's
holding you back? You need a better reason than
that, all right, right buddy? It's like, hey, what
happened to Greg? He went to prison. Why? He met a really cool kid. That checks out. All right, yeah, but it's
good to get outta New York. That city will eat
you alive, you know? Good to be here. I live in the West
Village of Manhattan. You know, a real
cool neighborhood. The Gay Pride parade actually goes right
by my house every day. I like a gay area. Gay guys are the best,
progressive, nonviolent. You never meet any
violent gay guys. There's no gay gangs. That would just be a musical. Any gay guys here tonight? - Yeah. - Hey, all right. Thanks for coming out. Big fan. One of my best friends is gay. He's obsessed with
straight guys. That's like his thing, you know? He's like, I love
flipping a hetero. He's like, you know
how hard that is? You know how hard it is
to go out every night, see a bunch of people
you wanna have sex with who don't wanna
have sex with you? I was like, that's
exactly what it's like being a straight guy. What the hell are
you talking about? I would argue, it's
just as hard for me to sleep with a woman as
for you to flip a hetero. He was like, nah, nah, nah. You have no idea. You gotta take him out
for hours, convince him. Yeah, yeah, same here. He's like, nah, no, no. Even if you do pull it off,
which is like a miracle. They feel horrible after. Yeah, yeah, same thing. We went back and forth for hours arguing about this all
night, back and forth. Eventually, I woke
up at his place. Oh yeah. I went to the gay
Pride parade last year. Still sore. Had a good time, met a lot
of characters out there. Met a gay guy there,
hated straight people. I never heard of that,
he was a heterophobe. I didn't know that was a thing. He was like, yeah,
screw straight people. You guys are the worst. I was like, whoa. Come on man, we gotta get along. Also, without us,
you wouldn't be here. Don't bite the hand
that breeds you. Yeah, and I have
to ask who's gay 'cause I have the
worst gaydar of all. I can't tell who's gay. One of my friends is always
bragging about his gaydar. We'll go out, he's like,
he's gay, he's gay, he's gay. I'm like, well that's
not that impressive. I mean, we're at a gay bar. I don't know, you want to
impress me with your gaydar? Start pointing out gay babies. Now, that's impressive, right? Like, see that kid
breastfeeding over there? Between you and
me, he's miserable. That's a hell of a gayby. Yeah, I like all
the girls, lesbians. Any lesbians in the house? Hey, alright. Wow, yes. I love your websites. I feel like lesbians
are underrepresented. I travel the country
doing comedy. I always see fun gay
bars in every city. They always have fun
names like the manhole or the back door. Where's all the
fun lesbian bars? Where's like the
dugout or scissors? Also, you always
see a group of girls with one gay guy in it. You never see a group of
guys with one lesbian. I'd love to with
lesbian in my crew. That'd be fun 'cause gay
guys are very helpful. They help girls with
their hair, their outfit. I'd love to have a lesbian
help me out with stuff. You know like crap,
the car won't start. She's like, I got it. Yeah, you flooded it, you pussy. Thanks Debbie, glad
you brought your tools. Satire, all right. But you guys are cool, you know. A lot of crowds
getting sensitive. It's getting weird out there. I got yelled at
at show recently. This guy goes, hey buddy,
that's a trigger word. I was like, whoa I think
it's pronounced trigga. Easy there, big fella. And look, if you get upset
or offended, that's cool. I'm not one of those guys. You're allowed to be
offended, that's totally cool. But if you are, just shut up. You're not a hero, you're
just ruining a show. Just be offended, just
let it flow through you. You just feel it, right? Yeah, don't share. We don't care, just feel, yeah. We all have thoughts. I might wanna sleep
with your girlfriend. I just hold it in.,
I don't say it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I just feel it. We're so obsessed
with words now. It kinda shows how
good we have it, we've gotta focus
on words, you know. Like in the seventies,
it was all about actions. Like if you wanna show you're
brave in the seventies, you had to jump over 12
buses on a motorcycle. Now I see a guy make an
off-color joke at the office, I'm like, that guy's
fuckin' fearless. Wow, yeah, I don't know. People take things so seriously. I guess they gotta show you their personality
by yelling at you about stuff that bothers 'em. I don't know, like I don't
mean any of this stuff. I'm just saying words
in a certain order
to elicit laughter. People like try to figure
me out through my act. It's all jokes. I told an abortion joke recently
and a woman approached me. She was like, hey,
that's very insensitive. I've had an abortion. You shouldn't tell
jokes like that. I was like, whoa, hey,
sorry, I just told a joke. I think what you
did was much worse. But you know, either way I'll
see it home later, honey. And again, all jokes. I love abortions, I
paid for two last week. I'm a fan, right? You remember, come on. It's all jokes. A friend of mine, she works
at Planned Parenthood, she loves that joke. And I was like I might
have to get rid of it. People don't like it. She's like, no, no,
you gotta keep it. I was like I might
get rid of it. She's like, no, no,
you gotta keep it. I was like I might get rid it. I was like, don't tell me to
do it with my body of work. She's like, every
joke's a miracle. But I don't wanna upset
anybody, you know? Ah, geez. I don't wanna upset. That's not my
intention, you know. I'm upsetting people
on accident now. I was at a Starbucks recently,
this guy handed my coffee. I went, hey, thanks chief. This guy goes, ooh,
don't say chief. It's offensive to
Native Americans. I was like, how
is that offensive? He goes, whoa. Don't say how. Come on, How'd we get here? Weird times, weird times. Taking words away,
you know, I get it. You know, words hurt people. I get it, you know? But here's the
thing, we're kind of in like a weird
word prohibition. Can't say this, can't say that. That's why I feel like
every now and then, we should all go to a
politicly incorrect speakeasy. Just somewhere we can all
go to say horrible stuff and nobody cares. You got no hate in your heart, you don't wanna hurt anybody,
but if you can't say it there, give us a place you can, right? You go down some creaky stairs, you bang on a big steel door. The guy's like,
what's the password? Retarded. Get in here. All right. It's like the nineties again. 'Cause offensive words,
they're like alcohol. Sure you can abuse it. Sure, you can hurt people. If you do it responsibly,
it's a good time. Just don't do it at work. Don't do it around kids. But go home, close the
door, take the edge off. Ah, midget. Right, I don't wanna
say little people. That's like drinking
O'Doul's, God. But of course I get it. I just, you know, find it funny. I get it, but
here's the problem. We forget that no one's
politicly correct up here. We're all animals. We're all seeing the same thing. We're all thinking
the same thing. No one's PC in their brain,
that's just a filter you put on when you talk
so you seem nice. Like no one sees a hot
girl bend over and thinks, look at that independent woman, like to treat her equally, huh? Nah, we're sick, men
and women, we're gross. But look where
it's all gotten us. Doesn't it feel like the
whole country's pent up. Feels live everybody's
angry right now. We got white supremacists,
protests, hate groups. It's weird you're allowed
to be hateful in America as long as you're not specific. Isn't that weird? You, if you're like,
I hate Mexican people, everybody's like, oh my God,
what a bigot, prejudiced. But if you're like,
I hate people, everybody's like,
huh, fuckin' right. Isn't that worse? People are angry now man. I had one of those white
lives matter rallies go by my house the other day. I freaked out, then I realized, oh, it's just a half marathon. That was close. I don't know, just
be a good person. What about that? Just be nice to
people, you know? Yeah, like a lot of
it doesn't add up. I can't keep track
of all the rules, like transgender,
what do you think? That's how I feel,
I don't give a shit. You wanna go for a man, a woman. Go nuts, well go labia. What's the beef? Look, it's weird to hate someone 'cause they're trans, right? But it's also weird to love
someone 'cause they're trans. Shouldn't you like 'em based
on who they are as a person? Content to the character? People are so phony. I love Caitlin Jenner, why? She sucks. She's against gay marriage
and ran over a person. What's the good part? And they go, well,
they have hard lives. All right, well so do midgets. Why don't you talk about
how much you like them? Where's that hashtag? I don't see any
tweets about midgets. Who's got it harder
than a midget? Hard to get around,
hard to drive, hard to get work, no love. And look, I'm not anti-trans,
but I am pro-midge. I just don't get why we help
one group and not another. It's just kind of trendy. And people say, well, trans
aren't allowed everywhere. Well, you've ever been
to a rollercoaster? At least trans we accommodate
with the bathrooms. Midgets, you ever see
how tall a toilet is? Well, imagine having
a jump to take a dump. Weird. No help, no support. And you know what's
great about midgets? I got a couple midget
friends, they're good eggs. You never see a
midget complaining. Never, every other
group complains. Never a midget, never
see it on the news. Sitting at a desk legs
dangle, a little fishing. Never, every other
group complains. I see women on the news. We have a glass ceiling. Midgets are like you're
worried about the ceiling? I'm trying to with
this counter, baby. Interesting, See, I
guess I'm too open minded 'cause I support all
transition, not just sexual. Why do we stop at sexual? I support transition
of personality, transition of opinion, right? Like Kevin Hart. Kevin Hart got in trouble
with some offensive tweets from years ago. Well, I'm not the same
guy I was from years ago. I've transitioned. I used to have sex with 16
year olds when I was 16. Now I don't, I'm different. Well, years ago he said
some offensive stuff. Well, years ago she
won the men's relay. People change. Why do you support
that and not that? Ah, it just tells me if I
ever get into trouble now, I'm just gonna get a sex change 'cause you gotta kiss my ass. Hey Mark, we heard that
interview from 10 years ago. Yeah, that was
Mark, I'm Margaret. I don't know, I support Kevin
Hart also cause he's midget. Oh, there we go. But I don't know,
everything's weird now. You know, the news is insane. The Internet's full of hate. I feel like it's the little
things to keep you happy now. You gotta cherish
the little things. I got a Snapple today,
I love a good Snapple. I love that fun fact
down in the cap. It was a good one today
it said polar bears used to be brown, but through
evolution they turned white because police
were shooting them. I know. I couldn't believe they
fit all that under the cap. Yeah yes. A lot of racial talk, now. White privilege. That's a term we hear a
lot now, white privilege. But I thought it was
all about diversity. So shouldn't we talk about
everybody's privileges? Why we just limit it to Whitey? Let's spread the love. Let's make every
group feel good. Everybody's got something. Tall people, privileged,
seat at concert. Jews, no hell. Pretty good, pretty good. Women, ladies night. That's cool. Black people, I can't
wear a purple suit. Looks like fun,
everybody's got a perk. Indian people, even
if you're undateable, your parents will
arrange something, huh? Let's spread the love. Who's got the energy
to be racist, huh? That's gotta suck to be racist. Wouldn't that be weird? Just like you go to
the bank, you're like there's Jews here,
I gotta leave. What a horrible life. Man, put on an outfit,
go to a meeting. All that stuff. I don't care about any
group enough to hate it. Do whatever you want, go nuts. I don't wanna do
anything, I'm lazy. I don't wanna burn a
cross or a calorie. Everybody's worked
up on something. There's Muslims on airplanes. I'd rather a Muslim on
a plane than a baby. Never had a Muslim kick
the back of my seat and piss in the aisle. I'm just saying if the
airport had a baby ban, I wouldn't protest. Yeah, but transgender,
they're using the bathrooms. Well, they're still
using the toilet, right? They're not leaving a
hot floater in the sink. If that was like their
thing, then yeah, we should totally
have a meeting. That's crazy, you know? And you get the hillbilly guy. Well what if one of
these perverts puts
on a dress and looks at my wife in the bathroom? Ooh, what a score, some guy gets to see your
toothless wife shitting. What a lucky guy. Come on, go to work you lunatic. But hey, we've come a long way. We hate to admit that. We hate to admit it,
we've come a long way. Like in the fifties
we had whites only and blacks only water fountain,
which is incredibly sad, especially if you're
a thirsty Asian. What the hell were they doing,
drinking out of a faucet? No one talks about it. Never come up once, not a peep. Nothing, black
people are pissed. Can you believe this shit? We got our own water fountain. Asian guy's like, can I get
a sip, I'm dying out here? I got a triangular
hat to block the sun. I'm a big fan of Asians. I think they're the best group. I think they're number one. I don't think they get
the credit they deserve. I'm an Asian
supremacist all the way. I think they're
better than the rest. Any Asian people here? Hey, alright, you
should be working. Come on, what are you
doing having a good time? That's not the Asian
I know, God damn it. I want you dealing blackjack or sitting on a box
peeling something. Come on. Big fan, best group. Easily, the best group. No love, you guys get the
short end of the chopstick. It's pretty unfair. So quiet, so secure, Asians. Every other group's
gotta brag and boast. Every group's got a slogan. Black people, I'm
black and I'm proud. White people, white power, Hispanics, aye,
aye, aye, aye, aye. Not an Asian, just
head down, grades up. That's it. Asians are the beast. You never hear about
Asian crime, never. If I was an Asian guy, I would
just start mugging people and like, hey, it's
my word against yours. Big fan, big fan, oh yeah. I think the news is a problem. The news pits us all
against each other. News makes it seem like all white people
are scared of minorities. I don't think all white people
are scared of minorities. I do think a lot of white people are scared of looking racist. That's really the
big fear with Whitey. Like if I'm walking down the
street at four in the morning, I see a sketchy looking
white guy coming towards me, I'm like, crap, I'm
gonna cross the street. If I'm walking down the
street at four in the morning, I see a sketchy looking
black guy coming towards me, I'm like, crap, I wish I
could cross the street. I'd rather get stabbed
than look like an asshole. White people, we are so worried about looking
ignorant and bigoted, I guess 'cause of our history. Like I went skiing
recently with my friend, we're sitting on the ski lift. I was like why don't you see
more black people skiing? Why is that? My friend has no idea. But he is gonna, you know,
halfass his way through it, 'cause he doesn't
wanna seem dumb. So he is like, ah. you know,
they don't grow up with it. Like, well I'm from
Louisiana, I'm here. Well, skiing is very expensive. Ah, right, right, right, yeah, Yeah, you know, I've
never seen a black guy with anything expensive
on their feet. Just say, you don't
know, it's all right. You sound way worse. That's why black
people are smarter. White people, we do crazy stuff. We swim with sharks, we go
bungee jumping, cliff diving. Ask a black guy why
do they do that? They go, I don't know,
that's white people shit. That's a good answer. They don't sit around going,
well, you know, you're a puh. Yeah, I dunno, but look,
yeah, I'm a white guy. If I talk about race now, for some reason
another white person inevitably calls me racist. That's like what we do. It's like, I know you're
trying to seem like a hero, but you're gonna ruin that word. You're gonna take
the teeth out of it. It's like an important word. You're gonna ruin it. Like I was on the
subway recently. I was watching an
interracial couple make out. I was just staring at them. And the guy next to them
caught me and he goes, what the hell, I see
you staring at them. What are you racist? I was like, what
racist, no, I'm a creep. What are you talking
about, I'm hard. Not a racist, I'm aroused. It's an important word,
people abuse it all the time. Friend of mine, she's Puerto
Rican, we grew up together. She's like, I hate
going to the gym. The white women there
all gimme the stink eye 'cause they're racist. I was like damn, what happened? She's like, well first bring
my food in and I eat it. Then I played my
music really loud. I'm like, oh, maybe
they just hate you. Let's not lump together
all a Puerto Rico 'cause you're being a twat. You're being
inconsiderate and rude. Take a little
ownership, look within. You can't blame
everything on bigotry. Look, I grew up in a
black neighborhood. I was a bed wetter. I'd sleep at their houses. Eventually, they stopped
inviting me over. I wasn't like they
hate white people. No, I ruined their
fucking furniture. They didn't hate white,
they hated yellow. Sorry. Uhha, yeah. I like all the groups, I
just make jokes, you know? Remember jokes, yeah. I met a nice girl
in that Jewish app. What's that Jewish app
called, the Jewish one. What's the Jewish app? The other one, the
other one, payPal. Going pretty well, yeah. A lot of ladies here
tonight, that's exciting. I feel like this is
like your time, ladies. This is like the year
of the woman, you know? I went to the women's
march in Manhattan. That was cool. Although I gotta
say I haven't heard the word pussy yelled that much since that time I roller
bladed to high school. That was a tough morning. Yeah, it's kind of crazy what
women go through, isn't it? Like some guys just like
whip it out and stuff in front of women. That's wild, that's bold. See, I have a penis, so I'm
not that scared of new ones. But I guess if you
don't have a penis, a new one's gotta
be pretty scary. The closest I can
get to that feeling is once I was hanging
out with a friend and he just took out a gun. I was like, what the
hell are you doing? He's like, well you
know I had a gun. I'm like, yeah, but,
we're at Whole Foods. Cause a dick and a
gun are very similar. If somebody pulled out
either one right now, we'd all be like, whoa, is that
meant for me, jesus Christ. Don't point it at me, damn. Dick and a gun, very similar. Both pointy, they shoot things, they come in different sizes. You can get a
pistol or a shotgun. I'm circumcised
so I'm sawed off. But I guess guys who do
that, just get confused. 'Cause ladies, sometimes
you like a penis. So guys think, hey, she
liked one last night, why wouldn't she like
one by the copy machine? Women are so complex. Because I think generally
speaking, when it comes to sex, I think men are a
little more constant. You know, men like boobs, but we like boobs
across the board. Boob in the bedroom, great. Boob on the bus, also great. Dick in the bedroom, great. Dick on the bus,
call the police. Nobody's calling the
police on a boob. You see a boob out in the
wild, it's like seeing a deer. You're like, shh. It's majestic. Look, there's two now. Then your other friend walks
up, hey, look at that a boob. We're like you spooked it. Come on. Yeah, we're cracking down on
sexual harassment finally. That's good. You know who gets sexually
harassed more than women, the one group? Pets. Yeah, nobody ever gets
consent from a dog. Nobody, people just pick
it up, kiss it on the face, rub it's belly, do
that weird, creepy, long pet where you grab
the tail at the end. We're creepy as hell with
dogs and we sound like creeps. They like it, they're
begging me for it, yeah. Thank God dogs can't talk,
we'd all go to jail, right? Just some chihuahua
in a courtroom, like first he flipped me over. Then he caressed all
eight of my nipples. Then he slapped me on the
ass repeatedly and said, you're a good girl, good girl. Ah God, we harass
dogs all day long and they're perfect harassing. They can't talk, so
they'll never report you. That's why they're
man's best friend. Also, dogs forget stuff
after like two seconds. You could stick your
finger up a dog's ass and be like, well that
was weird, Frisbee! 'Cause really when
you break down our relationship with dogs, dogs are shameless, shameless
whores, aren't they? I mean they're
like gold diggers. Look at the deal
we've cut with a dog. Like, all right pooch, I
will house you and feed you, but I get to touch
you whenever I want. Dog's like, what,
are you kidding? That's fucking amazing. I'll do you one better, when you come home,
I'll hump your leg. I'll lick my balls
in front of you, and when you have
sex, I'll watch. That's fair. And cats, cats are
the exact opposite. Cats are like sexual
assault victims. They're all nervous, skittish,
head on a swivel, huh? You touch me, I'll
fucking cut you. I'll cut you, motherfucker. Hey you're not grabbing
this pussy, all right? Yeah, now leave me alone, I gotta look outta a
window for an hour. But hey, you gotta
listen to ladies, fellas. You gotta listen, you know. Friend of mine, she's
like a big feminist. She's like I have a full bush,
'cause that's how I was born. I was like, holy hell, you
were born with a full bush? That is a terrifying baby. Cut the umbilical cord. I can't find it. I like a strong woman. I want a woman to cat call me. Cat call us ladies,
that'd be hilarious. Start yelling out stuff at
men that we don't wanna hear, stuff that would scare a guy. You know you walk past a
group of girls at night, one of 'em is like, Hey, I'll tell you I love
you on the first date. You're like, Jesus Christ. That is terrifying. Yeah, get us back. You know, you walk past a girls, she's like, hey,
before we have sex, I'm gonna poke a
hole in the condom. This is a horrible neighborhood. Start the car. Oh, you ladies are fascinating. So complex. Yeah. One time me and my girl
were watching the news. There was a whole thing about
a CEO harassing his employees. She's like, can you
believe this creep grabbing women's asses, whispering, dirty stuff
in their ear at work. I was like, yeah, it's crazy. Then we got home later in
the bedroom, she's like, can you do that stuff
from the news to me? I was like, I thought
you hated that. She's like, I hate
when he does it. If you do it, it's hot. Huh, so you hate harassment
unless you like the guy, then it turns you on. That's fascinating. I don't think other
groups like black guys get harassed by the cops, but at night they're not
like, come on, pull me over. Yeah, taze me, bitch, yeah. Interesting. Yeah, my gal, she likes being
insulted in the bedroom, which is cool, but
nobody tells you that not all insults are sexy. Had to learn that the hard way. Yeah, we'd be having sex. I'm like, yeah, ya whore. She's like, yeah. I'm like, yeah, you slut. She's like, yeah. I'm like, you're a bad driver. She's like what? I'm like, that's the
one that bothered you? Weird. She's like, you really
think I'm a bad driver? I'm like, sorry you dirty skank. She's like, thank you. Yeah, yeah, sometimes
I'll try to hook up and she's like I can't have
sex tonight, I don't feel sexy. I can't have sex if
I don't feel sexy. Wow, if that was the case for
me, I'd still be a virgin. I've never felt
sexy my entire life. The whole concept of
sexy is very arbitrary. You know, your girl comes in, I'm wearing my sexy
leopard print underwear. Well, when do we decide leopard was the sexiest animal print? I dunno, Nothing
says sexy underwear to me like yellow
and brown spots. In that case, I'm wearing
my sexy underwear. It's a rare jungle cat
called the Skid Mark. Yeah, how about the true crime? You gals love a good true
crime, all that stuff. Forensic Files, Killer Women,
Dateline, hours of this stuff. My gal caught me watching
two seconds of gay porn, she flipped out. She was like, what the
hell's going on here? I was like, well,
you watch murder. Isn't that way weirder? She's like, well,
you're watching this. Do you wanna do that? I was like, well, do
you wanna kill me? She was like, oh, shut up. I'm just watching my show, so I know what to do, if I
ever get in that situation. I'm like, well, maybe that's
why I'm watching gay porn. I want to know
how this goes down so I get the hell
outta there, right? She's like, that's ridiculous,
this is a reenactment. Well, this is too. This guy's not really
a real estate broker. Too much porn. I think porn has really
changed the game, you know? Outta the gate now,
sex is much kinkier, I think 'cause of porn. Outta the gate now it's like choking, spitting,
finger up the butt. Which is weird 'cause
these are all things my older brother
did to torment me. It's all the same shit. We've just taken bullying
outta the playground, brought it in the bedroom. I got my girl on top now,
I'm like Indian sunburn, ah. Seriously, you go to a
school yard during recess, some kids holding a girl
down, pulling her hair, calling her names. I'm like, man, he's good. I'm taking notes. Get back to your girl. She's like, wow,
where'd you learn that? I'm like couple of
third graders actually. But don't worry,
I like red wine. It's weird out there, who knows? You gotta get married, right? That's what you do, ugh. Scary, huh? Marriage feels so antiquated. Feels like we've come
so far with everything, yet we're still
doing that thing. What are we doing? Especially the ladies. Every girl I've ever dated is like when are
you gonna propose? Clock's ticking,
pop the question. Why do you wanna get
married so bad, what is it? Ladies, you come so far. But when it comes to marriage, you guys get kinda
old-fashioned. I want the ring and
the cake and the dress. What, grow up. Ladies, you're killing me. Go frolic, be free. But it's my special day. All right, why do you
have to ruin mine? I dunno, I feel like a lot
of guys look at marriage the way women look at anal. You know we're both just like, well we all knew
this day was coming. Let's get it over with. I'm not sure it's
even natural, right? Either way, when it's all
done, we'll get new sheets. But that's why you
ladies are brilliant. You gals are geniuses, 'cause
you guys tend to be the ones who wanna get
married to somebody who designed it where
the man asks you. That's some Jedi level
trickery right there. You're like, Yoda. I wanna get married,
but you'll ask me. Yes, you got it and you'll get
down on one knee, no problem. And you'll buy an
expensive ring, will do. And whose idea was
this, all mine. Well played ladies, well played. See like, guys, we gotta cool
it with the sexual aggression. We come on too strong. We're creepy, we're scary. Ladies, you guys gotta cool it with the commitment aggression. That's where you guys push. That's where you
guys get creepy, when are you gonna
exchange keys, when you gonna move in,
when do you get married? It's like, well
hey, no means no. Slow down, I feel pressured. I'm not ready, huh? And your family jumps, said, hey, when are gonna make an
honest woman outta my daughter? What, who's this guy? Imagine my dad did that. Hey, when are you
gonna bang my son, huh? Back off. I don't know, am I nuts? Marriage just feels like the least romantic
thing on the planet. It's legal. You gotta go to a
courthouse, get a license. What's the license for? That's the only license we
don't check, by the way. Driver's license,
liquor license. People check a fishing license. I'm gonna start checking
a marriage's license. Next time I see a
short, broke, weird guy, who's like that's my
hot wife over there, I'm gonna be like,
let me see some ID. I don't buy it. I just got my license renewed. You know what's weird? When you buy alcohol, you
show your driver's license. Isn't that weird? The thing I'm not supposed
to do with this stuff, you want me to prove I can do? By that logic,
when you buy a gun, you should show your
marriage license. Right? Lady walks in, I'll
take that revolver guy. Guy's like, lemme see
some identification. Why, you've been
married 60 years. You know what, just take it. I don't know, then
you gotta have kids. Ooh, kids are scary. I like babies, babies are fun. You know why babies are great? 'Cause they're not evil yet. There's a million
douche bags out there, but you never assume that
baby will become one. Isn't that nice? That's why no one ever goes
up to a pregnant woman, rubs her belly and goes, goes,
ooh, this one's gonna suck. No, it's all up, it's all
potential, it's all positive. Oh, it's kicking. Might be a pro
soccer player, right? It's never like, oh,
it's kicking, might
hit his wife, ooh. Statistically, way more likely than a pro soccer player, right? Plus it's already hitting
a woman, not even out yet. Yeah, I don't know, I
gotta figure something out. Being in a relationship
is always tough, you know? I've always had people say
weird stuff to me like, Mark, you're a comedian,
must be a great boyfriend. Why do you say that? Well, women love funny guys. All right, you've taken the
one singular positive aspect. If you do it with any guy, they could be seem
like a great boyfriend. Serial killer, take
out the killing, this guy's organized and
cleans up after himself. Terrorists, take
out the terrorize, this guy's passionate,
loves to travel. Child molester, take
out the molesting, this guy's got a van and
can't wait to start a family. I just got a bad
brain, I'm too literal. Literal is bad with
dating and stuff. I had a blind day once,
right when the girls saw me, she goes, hey, I bet we'd
have really cute kids. I was like, all right, I
bet we'd have great sex. And she goes, whoa, slow down. I was like, slow down? You're nine months ahead of me. Ah, this girl hated me. She was like, you know, I
feel very brave tonight. I was like, why is that? 'Cause I'm not
wearing any makeup. I was like, how's that brave? Because I'm being my true
self, being the real me. I was like, oh, okay. She's like, you should be brave. I'm like, yeah, maybe I will. She's like, what
are you gonna do? I was like, I'm gonna stop
pretending this is interesting. She was like, wow, I can't
believe you just said that. I was like, yeah, took guts. I don't know, working on
it, trying to get better. I dunno, I realize I'm a weirdo. I remember I had a
one night stand once, went great, fun
night, hanging out, but during the sex you did a
new one I'd never seen before. She acted like a four year old. You ever come across this? We'd be having sex, out
of nowhere, she'd be like, you know, if you want
to you can pull my hair. I was like, all right,
and we keep going. You know, if you want
to you can slap my ass. I was like, you
got it, keep going. You know if you want
to can choke me. I was like, I do. And we finished. We had a great night. We're laying there
and I was like, you know, if you want
to, you can leave. She didn't care for that one. I thought the timing
was perfect, you know? A lot of girls get mad about
the whole leaving thing, but it's nothing personal
against you ladies, I'm just a weirdo, I'm
in my head, I'm a nut. I'm an introvert, I
gotta get outta there. A lot of girls
get mad like what, do you just bang me and leave? Well, yeah, this
was a long night. I've been trying to win you
over for like nine hours. I'm exhausted. They were five guys at
the bar hitting on you. I had to out charm them, be more interesting,
be conversational, be funny, be on all night. She was like, what, you could
have just been yourself. I'm like, what are
you fucking stupid? Be myself, what? I'm an idiot, if I was
myself, I'd be like, hey, you fat whore,
let's fuck, ah. That's not gonna work. She was like, well
I don't get it. Why do you wanna leave? Like, I don't know, I just
wanna go talk to somebody. Well, why not talk to me? I just wanna go
talk to a friend. Well you can tell me anything. I'm like, well that's not true. She's like, I swear to God you can tell me
anything you want. I was like, all right,
well I recently had sex with a woman and she
won't let me leave. So that ended. What is that with
the leaving ladies? That one really hits
a nerve with you guys. Ladies, you want a guy to
stay, make 'em, wanna stay. Like guys, we have pick lines. Ladies, you need stay put lines. That's where you kick in. It's okay, I approach
you at a bar. I was nervous. I was on my heels
shucking and jiving. I made it work, now you want
me to hang out, so you do it. Isn't that justice? She's like, well, you're not
being that fun right now. I'm like, I know,
I already did that. That's how fucked I you. But now you want me
to stay, so you go. It's just a shift
change, that's all. Win me over, charm me,
sweep me off my feet. You do it. I don't get it. Girls are always like, I
want this guy to like me. You push your boobs
together, wear high heels. You look sexy as hell. Then a guy has sex,
you're like, that's it? Well, that's what
was advertised. It's very confusing,
you tricked me. Your outfit's like
a movie trailer. I'm like, oh, I
wanna see that movie. I go see the movie,
then I go home. I don't sit around going, I
gotta get to know this theater. And I'm not saying
the theater sucks or anything's wrong with
it, just wasn't advertised. Talk to me I love. I had a girl once, you
can't leave, you fucked me. Well, is this how you get
people to hang out with you? How about a conversation,
anecdote, knock,
knock, something? Ladies, you do kegels,
tighten up those stories. I don't even get why
this is so controversial. I'm just tired, I'm exhausted. I've been bringing
the heat all night. I've been playing the
hits, I'm exhausted. I wanna go. She's like, well how could
you be fake all night? I'm like, well,
you faked it too. You don't look like that,
you're wearing makeup. We're both full of shit. Your eyes don't go ugh
at the end or whatever. We're both lying, I'm just wearing makeup on
my personality, that's all. I dunno, like ladies,
you know when you go out to dinner with a guy, you're like, just cause
you bought me dinner, doesn't mean I owe you sex. And that's true, but just 'cause you let
me have sex with you doesn't mean I owe my morning. Right, it's the same exact
transaction, equality. That's why it's weird. Women go, we're just
as horny as men. Yeah, maybe, but you have a
lot more requirements, ladies, quite a checklist. You're like the
Goldilocks of dick. This guy's too short. This guy's too dumb. This guy's just right. Guys, we'll the porch. And I'm not saying one is
better or worse, just different. I go to the doctor, he's
like, what happened? I was like, it was too hot. But look, I get it. You know it's gotta
be tough to be a lady. I feel like women
are getting screwed in the orgasm department. I feel like men are having
way more orgasms than women and that sucks. People talk about the wage gap, the orgasm gap is outta control. You gals are getting
77 cents to the boner. Like if a woman had to have
an orgasm to get pregnant, they'd be like two people here. And you get nothing for
your orgasm, ladies. Like if a guy has an
orgasm, go and get pregnant, carry a baby for nine
months, deliver the baby, then breastfeed the baby and
all the guy had to do is this. And he tried really
hard not to do that. It's a horrible
setup of the woman. The guy has all the fun. The girl does all the work. That'd be like if I ate
a whole chocolate cake, and the girl gained weight, then she went to the
gym and I got buff. Gotta be tough. Plus, women constantly
judged by your looks. That's gotta be exhausting. Constantly judged by your looks. But y'all know how to look good. You all look great. That's how women figured out
to take the selfie up here. That was all you ladies. You know where your
good sight lines are. I think that's why
women like tall guys. Just some guy look at
you from your best angle, 100% of the time, all day long. That's why you don't
hook up with short guys. Just some guy like, geez, look at the triple
chin on this broad. Yeah, you like a tall man
ladies, and that's okay. That's how you're wired. You're all a bunch of
height supremacists. That was always the
first question back
on the dating apps. You over six feet, you over
six feet, you over six feet? I felt bad after a while. I felt I had to come
up with something. I was like, well no, but if it helps, I'm
still growing as a person. Eventually I got annoyed. Well, one girl was like,
how much do you weigh? She was like, whoa
that's body shaming. It's hard for me to lose weight. It's even harder for
me to gain height. Plus men are so visual. That's a lot of
pressure, constantly. Men are so visual. You never know what
your guys looking at. My ex-girlfriend, very paranoid, always going through my phone,
sock drawer, sniffing me. Always looking for clues. That's why I'm surprised you don't see more
female detectives. Ladies, you guys would
be amazing at that. You guys are intuitive, you're
curious, you're persistent. I feel like you gals
would crack every case as long as you thought
it was personal. That's the key. Like man, this guy killed
18 people in Fresno. So what? Well, he is also cheating
on your best friend. Give me the file. Crack that case in an hour. Gotta be tough ladies. Constantly judged by your looks. Gotta be exhausting. But somehow men get
the blame for this. Like it's just men judge
women, which we do. But ladies, you guys judge
each other quite harshly. You judge yourselves
by your looks. You do stuff to your looks
men don't even care about. You get your nails done. Who's that for? We don't give a fuck. All this jewelry and stuff. No guys have been like, oh my God, see that
necklace Kelly was wearing? Holy hell, ah. That's all you, we don't care. But it's always men. A friend of mine, she
got breast implants, so I was like, hey,
they look great. She goes men so shallow. I got these for me. I was like, okay, well
then you're shallow. Why is this on me
all of a sudden? Look, we're all
shallow, alright? But ladies, you can
tell you're shallow by who you get offended by. Friend of mine, some guy
called her overweight. She flipped, started
dieting every day, just to spite this guy started, exercising just out of anger. I bet if my friend
got called dumb, she wouldn't angrily
go back to college. Interesting. They say the C word is the
worst you can call a woman. I think it's fat. What do you think ladies? C word is bad. Shouldn't call a
woman the C word. But I think fat is worse
'cause it's visible. The C word's an opinion. That's why no woman ever looks
in the mirror in the morning and goes I just
feel cunty today. What do you think, cunty? Is this putting off cunt,
cunty in this, I don't know. You could measure fat,
there's a scale right there. There's no unit of
measurement for the C word. That'd be a great infomercial
though, wouldn't it? Whew, I feel so much better
after I lost 13 cuntometers. But that's the thing, ladies, I feel like you gals get
so down about your looks, but you can do so
many amazing things you never really brag about. Let's go through a list
of stuff women can do that's unbelievable. First of all, you
can make people. That's insane. People are coming
out of you alive. You could be bragging
about that constantly. I know men who will take
a photo of a good shit. - You're making human beings. How annoying would men be
if they could make people? I made him, him, him, him. Men named kids after them,
they didn't even do anything. That's Jimmy Junior. Oh yeah, what do you do? I came. She didn't, I gotta do
everything around here. Ladies, you can feed people. That's bananas. You got grade A, vitamin
D, organic milk on tap. What, you got a cup
of coffee, right here. Bowl of cereal, I got you. You're a fucking dairy. I know a girl, she's
lactose intolerant, still producing milk. She's making something
she can't even tolerate. Much like my mom did with me. Ladies, you live longer than men and you have a higher
threshold for pain than men. On paper, you're like
a superhero on paper. But that's the thing, you
ladies are so incredible. You're such amazing beings. Yet you're some of the most
insecure people I've ever met. It's always by looks. Do I look good in this,
is this turning you on? You like that, do
I look fat in this? This doing anything for
you, what about this? You're a woman, own it. If I was a woman, I'd be the
cockiest bitch on the planet. What, do you have a paper cut? I've been bleeding
for three days. This fucking guy, huh? What else you got? Oh, you cut yourself
shaving, aww. Last week an immigrant
waxed my taint. WHat's that, you pushed
out a kidney stone? Ooh, I pushed out a
little league player. How do you like that? Now gimme those Fruit Loops, ah. But one of the most
amazing things about women, the thing you get no
credit for, ladies, the most unbelievable
impressive thing is your ability to hide everything. Everything's a goddamn secret. You're all in the CIA. You have the real you, then
the you you let us see. We'll go with menstruation,
pretty big deal. Let's start there. You hide it pretty goddamn well. Men are clueless. We have to guess. Is it that time of the month? What do you think? Time of the month, is she
acting weird, what do you think? The time of the month? You realize that if
men got their period, there'd be blood everywhere, on the walls, the
sidewalk, everywhere. These guys walking to work, ah, uterine lining,
Jesus Christ. Holy hell, God damn it. Give me one of those
masculine napkins, Thank you. Yeah, oh yeah. You too, huh Jeff? Guess we're synced up. Yeah, there we go, all right. There we go, yep. Says don't flush
it, but fuck it. It's all hidden,
everything's hidden. I used to work in an office
in Midtown Manhattan. I was the only guy on the floor. It was me and like
a hundred women. I never heard one fart, Not
a toot, not a queef, nothing. Nothing. Sometimes on Friday, I'd
bring in chili and just wait. Nothing. I farted up here
eight times tonight. I walked in on one woman
once, once, taking a shit. It was like I walked
in on a murder scene. She was like get the
fuck out of here. Jesus Christ, take it easy. You're allowed to shit. I'm the opposite. You walking in on me
shitting, I'm like, hey, what'd you bring? Nothing, you're giving
us nothing, ladies. All your sexual stuff, that's all under
wraps, very hush, hush. Men walk around, I'm an
ass man, I'm a boob man. Ever see a woman go
I'm a ball gal, yeah. I love that sack. Nothing, giving us nothing. Then you want us to know how
you're feeling and stuff. What are you kidding,
we're in the dark. Sometimes I'll read a
Cosmo, a woman's magazine, just to get some inside dirt. One time I was reading a Cosmo,
there's a full page article on how to go down
on a woman properly. It's like this should be in like Guns and Ammo or
Field and Stream. Sports Illustrated. Teach us ladies,
we wanna please. God damn it, you
got fake eyelashes, hair extensions,
spanks, foundation. You should know
what I'm thinking. I don't even know you
fucking look like. That's why it's weird
when a woman's like, you wanna have sex with me? Gotta get to know me first. Get to know you? You're wearing three
pounds of jewelry, clown makeup, and have been
holding a fart for four weeks. I dunno who the hell you are. That's why it's so
important to have sex. It's not just cause we're
horny, psycho animals. We are, but it's important 'cause you finally
see behind the curtain for the first time,
and it's glorious. Ladies, your hair is messed up, you're naked, yelling
out filthy obscenities. Like, damn who's this? Your friend calls,
hey, it took a month, but he banged Sarah, how was it? Great, I finally met her. He's like, oh man, all
right, well come over, we'll talk about it. I'm like, I can't, she
won't let me leave. Thanks a lot. You guys were great. What a crowd. Thank you so much
for coming out. I appreciate it. Stay sober, get home safe. Have a good day, thank you. Have a good night, sleep it off. LA I love you."

everybody so good to have an intervention and it's like  them that's why there's no traffic on the Serengeti a bunch of lions just standing there and  our lady you get up there there's some hyena licking his balls so I got a girlfriend man i watch a lot of watch a lot of TV with her you know I just said no way the hell out of it she loves watching The Oprah Winfrey Show and I love like watching her watch The Oprah Winfrey Show and I wait for Oprah's say something stupid in the second she does I just take it out on my girl because I'm an  no we're watching it the other day you know Oprah's on there she's interviewing some Klan yeah she's giving her this big ridiculous intro like she's done this she's done that she's done this and she does the most difficult job on the planet she's the mother it continues on immediately I just look at my girlfriend looks like really being a mother is the most difficult job on the planet oh yeah all those mothers who die every year for Black Lung from inhaling all that cold us the women are just constantly patting themselves on the back about how difficult their lives are and no one corrects them because they want to  well it's just this tornado of like misinformation and the most difficult job on the planet what would you rather be doing drilling to the center of the earth shaking hands with the devil every time there's a rumble in the ground you wait for the whole thing to collapse down on top of you so they can write that folk song about you yeah what you writing me up in the sunshine running around with a couple of toddlers that you can send to bed anytime you want let some sort of trumped up charges right cuz you want to have a drink and watch The Price is Right I couldn't believe it it's a no difficult job on the planet I thought roofing in the middle of July is a redhead I thought but these mothers are bending over at the waist putting DVDs into DVD players dude any job that you can do in your pajamas it's not a difficult job question 35 years old playing hide-and-go-seek you live in the dream the dream go time card no taxes you're off the  grid they could popsicle stick houses I mean it's an us difficult job on the planet Oprah's not even a mother  branded neither of mine but I could think of that balances itself oh I'm so full of  I really really realized that about myself maybe that's one thing about getting old he just realize how full of  you are you know people ask you questions you just start answering them get to that point you're just watching the  coming listening taking notes yeah it's like I flood everything in high school why would you listen to me you know have a lunch with this girl the other day right right in the middle of lunch she looked across the table for me and she goes this is gonna seem oddly racist this is gonna be awesome 41 years old never heard a conversation started this way let's see what you got she just like um there are a lot of Asians in this restaurant look that's not racist listen observation there are a lot of Asians in this restaurant however if you were to say what the  are all these  Asians doing this goddamn restaurant that would seem oddly racist but you still haven't said anything bad about Asians but you definitely seem to have a problem with that being and the restaurant which is on that's odd because I've never heard any bad stereotypes about Asians and restaurants you know enemy like dude they come in there taking up all the tables you know just beat all Asian wait here y'all you is but they're driving right and even that one's  stuff that they suck there's no happy medium you know see the Tokyo Drift 90 miles an hour driving sideways parallel parking and breakdancing into the club right like Jesus Christ is that guy from the future possessed all of that talent well they just stop it in an intersection it's boring it's almost like it's so simple I just start daydreaming and I don't know I find a lot of that a lot of that racial stuff like fascinating you know like the different rules of like how who gets in trouble who doesn't like I've noticed black people have the genius to put the curse word after they say the race of the person where white dudes we always put it in front and if we would just make that little adjustment we could save so many careers how many to pups could be saved in the white community if we would just put it after you never noticed that in conversation here black every like man I was standing in this Asian well  came in he starts talking about we don't even hear it what did this Asian mom  dope I would love to hear the rest of this story right dude I would tell the exact same story right I'm standing there right his  a just said what he said he's suggesting he's

transfer you to me I'm sorry well I would be upset to thir I understand I earn I totally understand and I'm sorry and there's nothing I can do right and the whole time you only know what they're doing is trying to get you to curse so you hang up no so they can hang up on you that's all I do it just trying to get you to curse so you see they can just hang up on you you know so they say gradually but if you don't curse they can't hang up on you you can just keep torturing but why is that you just just keep it going around and around and what they do is then they try to suddenly make it your fault well sir did you know did you know your plane was gonna be late well why didn't you call ahead well I didn't call ahead cuz I was our  airplane then you're gonna start all over again do you know how many times a week people say to me why are you yelling and I never feel like I am like this right here is not yelling to me it's just you know I'm passionate about my opinions and I want you to hear all of them before you get the clock again I'm not yelling I've got another couple of octaves that was brutal I don't want to be this guy you know I'm halfway through my life at this age you know when I've been an angry son of a  and I got to turn this around man I'm a Barris with my bi don't be that guy you die is the angry guy that's the worst dude to diets because then people gotta try to think a happy  to say about you it's your funeral they just sitting there like he was a son of a  I earned his shirt saying I got nothing I don't know what else say about the guys no no I noticed you know what no I had an anger problem was one just like little random things like I went to this place another time on the road the mortar and food that was done ordered the food and the guy behind the counter asked me if I wanted a cookie right and all of a sudden said his unbelievable urges to blast this guy right in the face my brain was just another but I say I say I wanna cook you don't  I say bring it up you bring it up you do it suck you'll just yell it across the restaurant you want a cookie your   that's what I realized they gotta anybody else's thoughts just wake him up in the middle of the night it's like I'm okay I'm gonna make it you know now you know I picked more was actually I'm a lot happier than I used to be man I  around a lot when I'm up here but I'm definitely a lot more happy all right my big move you know I decided I wasn't gonna go home for the holidays that was a big thing I had to say go one guy right there I had to I don't know what age you decided not to but I went home at 39 not married no kids and I was just like there is no way I am going home at 40 there's no way there's no way people are you like asking questions they just look at you weird just like no you're just you're just gonna tell jokes talk about disease and wish it on people and make fun of people who like cake is that what you're gonna do you know what I live in a cul-de-sac and have a couple of kids and gradually resent everyone and then take your own life you know anything yeah now dude I would love to be married but in my head it all makes sense like I you know I don't know what happened but it just it scares me when I see married guys I just get like nervous man I'm just gonna be like that stereotypical married guy you know just like a shell of my former self you know every weekend up on that silver ladder just scoop and  out of the gutters but neighbor coming over you know  Susy keeps getting bigger you wear this shirt for 11 years I don't know what happened to my dreams you know I just like coming up here cuz it's quiet up here think about what might have been yeah my neighbor's not even listening to me he's all excited about some garden hose he bought at Brookstone he's convinced it was designed by NASA actually it's got two nozzles one for the heart one for the pull really is it long enough to go around both our necks in the chimney so we can tandem jump off of this I know I just sort of mentioned killing myself there I don't want to freak you out all right cuz I did that joke when I was down in the Bible Belt and I was down south and this girl took me really seriously she came up to me at the end of the show she's like you're not really thinking about doing something like that are you I was like no just joking just joking she goes good cuz you know she can't go to heaven if you do stuff like that I was just like yeah you know I don't give a  it's not that I don't I just like freaking out people that are that religious that have a whole little checklist of  if you do this you go here if you do that how do you know that you don't know that shut up I think it's very normal thought to think about killing yourself you know I do you know it's weird anytime I think about killing myself it's never over anything big it's always little things little things make me want to take myself out it's bizarre like I'm my girlfriend broke up with me I'm not gonna lie to you I would be devastated devastated be laying on the ground crying in the fetal position for like three days you know about a fourth day you know I might rub one out you know I got a dude join the gym lie to myself that I'm gonna get the six-pack back I know what I gotta do right but little six I thought about killing myself like a year ago on Thanksgiving you know why I was was cuz I said I was gonna make a pie that little statement made me think about taking myself up this outlook this is basically the deal right my girlfriend's an angel she absolutely loves the holiday so it's like two weeks before Thanksgiving so she's all excited she's like oh my god Thanksgiving is coming up I'm trying to watch the game Thanksgiving what are you gonna do for Thanksgiving right I started freaking out like I didn't think I had to do anything but thanks good you know I just thought I had to you know not get drunk and be belligerent around your friends I thought I was fine she's like no I'm gonna make a turkey I'm gonna make stuffing what are you gonna do so I panicked I'm like I'll  make a pie make up I was just trying to make it go away never do that you disagree with them thinking to make them leave like yeah awesome what you said no but it totally worked it totally worked but she walked away completely excited she was like no way no way all excited and I totally forgot about right two weeks later Thanksgiving comes up right she just wakes up she's like oh my god Thanksgiving hey thank you you're gonna make that pie right he said you're gonna make a pie it's like I gotta make the party I gotta go to the grocery store I got to buy some flour then I just started thinking man why don't we just slam my head right through this plate glass window and just blend out right down the side of the house no I wouldn't have to so it's not even like I'm suicidal it's more like I'm like lazy I mean like whenever I know the next four hours of my life is gonna suck like I think about god I gotta pay my taxes it's a long line at the bank and that a bus is coming by what if I just don't head first right a little stumble backfires anybody else ever think of  like that you don't get speech ceiling fans somebody's telling me some stuff I don't want to do you need to pour into my deed we need your birth certificate the ceiling fans behind the head I'll get right on that so anyway so I decided not to go hope for the holidays it's what I'm really trying to tell you here no I did I kind of came to the Pitney I'm like man I'm 41 years old my dad had five kids by the time he's my age I got to get on with my life here so I was like on you know what I'm not not working Thanksgiving I'm not working Christmas I'm not working New Year's it was like the middle of October I was like wait a minute what about Halloween that my brain was like you know what  this I'm getting a pumpkin thank you that's how angry my brain is it can't be just like you know what hey let's get a pumpkin scope you don't  this let's get a pump that's when I started thinking carving that  oh man and I'll candy to the kids I'm meeting them at the door hey what are you supposed to be huh oh yeah full-sized Snickers who does ACDC pumpkin you haven't seen that before you have it right you tell all your friends when you sing that  what are you bringing to one side that's heavy here's another candy bar you like dumbbell walk break down the stairs this is how much of a maniac I am you know this is all true it took me four trips to go to the supermarket to finally be able to buy this goddamn pumpkin because every time I would walk in there to get it are we thinking all these happy thoughts this is a great thing I'm embracing the holidays it's gonna bring me and my girlfriend together there's a very loving thing to do when I reach out and grab it and all I'd hear in the back of my head is what are you  all right let me explain that joke to functional people in the crowd let me explain this all right this is how it works with cash anytime you do anything remotely sensitive heartwarming anything that's gonna make you more of a loving caring individual immediately all your guy friends suggests that maybe just maybe you want to suck a dick oh it's brutal even if you do something smart right like it's raining out   put your shoulders up you  homo Jesus Christ would you pull that thing out of your ass oh it's crude oh it doesn't even have to make sense you caught the pumpkin will you do next carve some guy's ass with your  what are you gonna blow a scarecrow go get away from me with your gay little pumpkin odds bro dude what do you a  is the reason why guys drop at 55 on a  nowhere it's literally from five decades it's just suppressing the urge to like hunger puppy admit a baby's cute say you want a cookie you just gotta keep pushing it down one day one day you're in a Denny's and if you get to put bananas and your pancakes you just have like an aneurysm and your head slams off that sticky table and the last thing you hear before it all goes black is your friends go   it's a horrible horrible way to live your life you can't like you're just dying every day does every dumb thing that you can do as a guy any stupid thing that's gonna shorten your life makes you more of a man  zero degrees out you know have a coat on dude you're cold can't admit it no I'm not hold I'm just taking a song I really agree with now trying to let go of this ball I hate in my chest that's why I don't have any kicks I thought I think it's irresponsible to be a complete maniac not work on yourself and then just have a kid and then just start downloading all your  up thought something that little Christine little hard drive you know just send them off to school with your little your little manifestos they're freaking out other kicks it's cool 2+2 Timmy once you get Danny keeps cash in the walls because he doesn't trust banks no it's embarrassing to know this little about yourself at my age man I got to get beyond like you know I finally ended up getting that pumpkin you know I did I actually had to bring my girlfriend down to the supermarket and I had to walk her by the pumpkins because I knew the second I did it she was gonna freak out and she did second she saw Jesus like oh my god a pumpkin Halloween's coming up we should get it that's doing like this little pumpkin dance and I had this unbelievable urge just to take her head and just  mush it right through the pumpkins and really hold it there for a second like feel the panic in the back of her head as the air bubbles became like less and less frequent she sat there contemplating surrounded by loved ones looking back on achievement it's so Orange god I resented her resented the fact she gets to be effect he does she gets to see pumpkin right sees a little puppy tries and sad movies I gotta hold on to all of that  slowly dying inside go out to go see a sad movie comes to the sad part what do I do she's crying I got to think of some funny  I would have somebody kick Sean Penn in the balls right now  alone that's right thank you sir I like that you turned this into a town meeting this guy downtown right it's exactly it I always wanted to cry when I was watching lifetime but you know who's never left  sick popped up on dayquil I think it's for the might that's my tribute to the film or that's the drug I did before I got that stage and to be a little buzzed right a little pedestrian way so anyways uh now my light I just feel myself I'm starting to change me I'm a happier person and I I think I'm ready man I want to have a kid it's a big thing I want to have a kid by the only thing I'm worried about about that is I like little kids I like them when they're little I don't like when they get bigger and they start thinking like they know  you know like I understand why parents hit their kids I get it you know I'm not staying take your day out on them but definitely you know they get a little lippy you know throw out a jab set the tone now when they start thinking they know stuff budget you know my buddy's got a kid his kid is at that age right they fighting me over to you know come to dinner the other day because I'm like at that age I'm like that weirdo guy they feel they feel sad for it so we gotta fight me over yeah I really have a pathetic existence it's my life so I'm sitting I'm trying to be social with the kid you know he's really into space so I'm like hey look the skies around and the stars are out the kids like actually that's not a star that what is Jupiter Jupiter is the fifth planet Wow  like you're impressed Wow really is it is it they won't shut up they just keep going on it's good 17 moods and I gotta sit there acting impressed cuz I'm just waiting for another adult to come by and just scoop the kid up and just rescue me gotta sit here and act like I'm amazed with this I saw a stripper quit on stage two months ago what do you think you're gonna tell me that's gonna blow my mind so the kid just kept going on and on it's good it's good I couldn't take it anymore sooner I finally did I just I had poured a little water on him I didn't know what to do is break this rose up peter knapp the demon at this social maturity to be like dude so I'm sitting there I am laughing my ass off I'm dying I'm like I cracked the code I finally figured out what to do in this situation and you know what this little bastard anyway in the kitchen he  told on me and my buddy's wife comes running out she starts screaming at me like I'm 5 years old which technically I am because I'm pouring water unlike you know six-year-olds right you don't do that we don't do that in this house and I said no no no no we don't do that that's my temper came up no yeah you know I'd  you  your kids  to Panera out of here I don't need this right now that I didn't do it I just sat down I was like look you poured water our kids okay send an honest moment myself I you know he tried to debate it in your head to try to make yourself right yeah but dude is bottled water like this kid doesn't get rained on that acid rain you actually you a cleansing his brow I don't know but I'm gonna have the kid cuz I like when that little it's just worth it you know I like toddlers man that's that's the best age they're hilarious you know they never have a shirt on they already got a beer belly even though they never drank before they're not even self-conscious they don't try to suck it in they just let it hang out over the diaper got like cereal in their hair they're a mess they just see people talk and they just come up they just stuck telling a story they don't have the decency to start at the beginning they like start in the middle then they jump back to the beginning and then they tell the end it's like a Tarantino movie like Travolta's walking by in the background heart attack like drooling all over himself then they make white beaters for little two-year-olds they should do it put a little fisher-price harley-davidson I can't take it they're adorable no but it's a scary time dude it's a scary time to raise a kid that's the only thing I'm worried about it's a really scary time you know I think I think they get ready to like microchip all of us I'm not even jumping dude if you see that new Duracell commercial with that woman can't find her kid in the park so what kind of a  up way is that to sell batteries it's a little hardcore don't you think but remember the old battery commercials they show some guy in a rainstorm right changing a tire takes out a flashlight all right thank God it turns out I can see how when I'm getting that was it not as shown this woman she can't find her kid in the park she's something like Kenan Kenan sitting there freaking out that she pulls out this device and then all son Kevin comes running out of the woods and then just like Duracell batteries like don't  the batteries what was that thing she just took we didn't have an antenna his sneakers weren't glowing what the  is in Kevin that is connected to that don't just show me that like that's normal  though that is some creepy New World Order  evidently it's a bracelet and they just put the microchip in there but that's how I got to do it they're gonna scare the  out of you that someone's gonna take your kid that's just a bracelet what if they take the bracelet I will just glue it to the forehead yeah but just sort of drill it in there I'm telling you whatever they're doing to dogs they're gonna be doing to us in like ten years right they got those six microchips with their balls cut off telling you we're gonna have us on TV waiting to get rescued like some account and look at all  up with the TV right that's what you're getting here in the future that's gonna be the future - to hear about Eddie Dodd they turned his chip off man dude the guy's  he is  he made one little joke about the government next thing you know he had to buy around his head wouldn't go through they kept standing it nothing he's outside screaming up with a satellite dude now two bankers I think they run the world bankers around the world according to my YouTube Wikipedia research don't listen to me I'm an idiot I swear to God I think they don't  blowing off the president you know that's what killed me

that's like the big thing yes I did I'm psyched I went down to the planet I got one of those free dogs free dog that's how I say it - I don't say I rescued a dog I hate when people say that stuff they said she's a rescue I rescued her really did you pull her out of a burning building did you jump in a river with your wingtips still on but not concerned for your own safety or did you just go to head the pound and get a free dog did she  I actually I did not want to get a rescue dog I did not want to do that my girl was all about it she's like we should rescue a dog you want to rescue a dog I'm like though no I don't she's like why not I go because I think a lot of the dogs down the pile might be a little  in the head who the shelter is that a pet store that it's like Shawshank for a golden retriever why don't we just go down out of the prison and rescue an inmate just roll the dice that may be the guy who was wrongly convicted do you mind  that I want a brand new 2009 bulldog all right I don't want some 1995 half a Labrador for part of its ear chewed off you know I gotta put together its backstory every time I go use the toaster it starts freaking out but his last owner hung them from the ceiling fan every time the Jets didn't cover the over get out kill you don't a rabbit swirl how fast a squirrel is if I was walking home at night minding my own business bothersome some squirrels started running at me by the time I process like is that a rat they're mechanical I know the up my leg taking chunks out of the side of my head I'd have to tell that story for the rest of my life in a bar know whatever the side of your head  sensitive no I'm not trying to say all those dogs are bad down there but what if I accidentally get one of those Cujo old yellers right I'm telling you they love dogs down there so much you got to watch out what they tell you I was down there there was just one dog this thing was staring at me so goddamn hogs maniac look a dog I'm like what's up with this dog she was just like oh he was chained to a pallet in a junkyard his entire life and I'm like doesn't have any issue she's like he's a little aggressive it's like what were you gonna tell me that  and it's gonna throw in my hatchback let me figure it out on the ride home he's pulling out a sharpened toothbrush to stick in my neck now that's what I'm saying what if I accidentally get one of those crazy dogs I get up at 2:00 in the morning to take a leak and that is the exact moment its previous owner used to come home shit-faced beat the crap out of the dog I have no idea what I'm setting up I'm sit there shuffle along in my slippers tie in my robe meanwhile the dogs getting all amped up like this I never be laying on the ground in a pool of my own blood what are you doing the dog then take them right back down to the pond like some sort of repeat offender we're gonna see him on the news and like shackles like shuffling along we knew you'd be back there get me a milk-bone go  yourself I'm gonna wheel him in like Hannibal Lecter with that lampshade around his neck  nasan we have like this stalemate you know I wanted the brand-new bulldog you know she kept seeing that

little innocent little dr. Seuss looking dogs where are the pit bulls where are the Rottweilers where those maniacs you see lifting weights down at the shelter I got the saddest looking dogs ever and she's whining over the top of them those dogs are looking all sad at the camera my last owner wasn't a nice person those ridiculous bandage it's like they're in Saving Private Ryan that Three Stooges rabbit ear I have a toothache that ship on that dog what happened I love that one it's all wrapped up like a mummy it's like how they get hit by a cannonball during a Civil War Reenactment then a Tyrannosaurus bigger my favorite ones that one i plug is a great dog bring that over the kids I'm sure that won't freak him out at all mommy to get us a dog just let him sniff - do not approach him from the right and gotta push for the right sticking around becomes an entirely different animal when you do that just know so she was in the van I wanted to get the Bulldog that was my thing I was like I want to get the Bulldog then I started researching on the Bulldogs I got all these health problems man from day one they can't even breathe they come out in the world it's like they don't work with asbestos their entire life you know some people they can't even breathe you gotta have him sleeping uprightness lazy boy rubbing vicks vapor rub on that chest we got like sleep apnea they die nine times every night why don't I just rescue a retired offensive lineman so didn't know what to do so we were at a stalemate so Mike Mike girl did what most females do they just figure I know it's good for him I know it's gonna make him happy I'm gonna make a major decision without him and then he's gonna deal with it yeah that's how I got a dog I got a dog when I was on the road I was on the road I just had a message on my machine it was just and I just heard she's like um okay I did something kind of involves both of us but I think you're gonna love it just give me a cow okay bye now does that sound like I just signed you up for a 12 to 15 year commitment doesn't sound like that right that sounds like I bought a new outfit I'm gonna drag you to some awful restaurant during a playoff game okay that's what it felt like so I'm ready for that argument she tells me she went out she got a dog now half of me isn't upset because you got a rescue dog yeah we have it for a week and you know if you want to keep it we can so I going let me see it so we started skyping and she's pans around you know what she got she got a pit bull  so he's been doing pull-ups it's entire life tripods were still taped up it's like shadow box but p90x Jesus Christ if she said like now he's three she said no she's adorable and all this stuff this is worst part I wasn't getting home for three days you know and she's all wrapped up in this dog you know and if I don't get home for three days what happens when I get home on Monday and you have to go to work she's goes well I just figured I Drive to work and you could just come home to the apartment and meet the dog that way look at you out of your mind I'm not coming home to that that dog is bonding with you and thinks you guys lived there I'm gonna come walking in at my camp ripped off cuz I'm trying to show my name on the phone bills so she do play what you do you take that hellhound you put it in the goddamn car drive it to work Park in the shade do whatever you gotta do I'm coming home to a safe house and then you drive home with the dog call me when you're a half mile away I'll meet you and Cujo down in the driveway we were all walking together I would be in the front to show that I am the pack leader because I watched half an episode of the dog whisperer and I think that that's what your fault again so true right so I've been out of the drive when I see you dogs are beautiful dogs literally like walking like a marine or some  like it's sleeping into some like okay here we go turning my back on a lot of pit bulls and I don't even know that turns out they didn't get at the shelter they found it by the LA River it lived by the LA River for two weeks and my girls response to that was like no it's  scary why is it scary well obviously it got enough protein so it wasn't eating berries out there that they was choking out coyotes breaking the Nexxus squirrels I don't know what it was doing but it definitely was he brought a murderer into the house we'll just rescue an alligator while you're at it just to add to the excitement so we get the dog in the damn house that's exactly what I thought was gonna happen dogs sitting there looking at her then it's looking at me and they're looking at her like who the hell is a new guy right you guys is a guy paying the  rent I was getting no respect so I was just like I also write down which I was like I know what she's doing I know what she's doing she's bringing this dog home cuz she thinks I'm gonna fall for it and then and then she will just have the dog and it's just like I love animals okay but I'm not gonna live with one that can  kill me and I rescue a chihuahua so when it flips out cuz I grabbed a remote too quickly I can flick it off the goddamn table or something you know sighs oh my god we got it for a week we got it for a week and then we make a decision so I just shut down emotionally  this dog first two days I didn't give a  you know dog sitting there looking at me and I was just like Jesus Christ then on Wednesday I don't want happen I started to like it a little bit you know I was watching TV you know I always talked to myself I'm always home alone I feel like a

right now I'm halfway through my life so you know get nervous you know about dying you know just growing old man I was never really nervous about till I got to this age and you know you know once I went to my grandmother's 100 year birthday party and I quickly realized that women age a lot better towards the end you know guys we hang with them in the beginning because we're young and then in the middle they're having kids so we kind of pass them but that end that last third we're like the stock market we just we just go right down to the ground it's brutal I went to this party all the old ladies they were unbelievably shocked I was still playing cars right there but some of the old dudes man they were brutal you know you ever see a guy like so old he has like that permanent look of horror on his face there's always that one guy just because walking in just like good even when they're sitting down meeting people and this is my grandson bill it's like dude how much pain are you in

whatever I gotta do I told you I didn't think about killing myself twice a week at this age there was no  way I'm going out like that the end of my life I'm walking around everyone else has that panic doll  is it going down what's in their face I don't know how you do it how do you wake up every morning brushing your teeth how do you fight the urge just jam that I'll tell you what kills me was only the old guys had that look on their face none of the old ladies did some of the old ladies had a look of like mild disappointment you know just sit like they always wanted to go to Europe but they never got around to it but only the old guys had like their it was almost like they wanted to tell you a secret like where's the gold can you remember the combination what is that somebody said it's

Adam Levine he  blew it you know what happened to him he messaged ladies on Instagram he couldn't help but he had two cool of clothes on he was like I deserve more he couldn't do it he would say a millionaire with a beautiful wife and family and even him he's in a finished basement on Instagram being like I got to see this lady's butthole I don't  care he  he  threw it away so is it dad you got

clothes he's like dude this is a button-down fishing shirt they have vents in the back for sweat it comes right out oh my dad just steps into a pair of Sketchers and becomes invisible to women dude it's  awesome making kids is crazy man it's like here's the thing like you don't realize how out of control you are of your life until you have like kids like kids plural the first kid you still don't really know like anyone can have one kid it's like getting a DUI your second kid that's when you're like oh I'm not in control of this at all because after the first kid it was such like a I was so Thunderstruck by the whole experience I started like telling my wife I'm like look we're gonna like we're gonna plan the next one we're gonna wait a little bit save some money my wife was like come inside me I was like yes ma'am foreign God damn it what the hell was that do you ever like eat a muffin before and like afterwards like wait I didn't even know I ate that thing that's what it was like what part of me just ate that total autopilot dude it was to be fair to me it is the best feeling in the world coming inside of your wife specifically just be respectful here your wife not your girlfriend that's the worst feeling in the world dude you get that in the principal's office stomach you're like oh  man  they're gonna tell my mom not your wife that's sweet dude it makes me feel like such a gross idiot that like that was my favorite thing I traded three years of sleep to just go  that feeling is the best man that  just that lightning bolt I figured out that's what that feeling is that like that's all the fun you would have had without kids leaving your body at the speed of light it's like it's a decade of free time 200 000 bucks you're like oh  and there's that like last little bit that's you know that's stuff you push out of yourself it's like a weekend trip to Atlantic City you're like  it I don't I didn't want to go to that stuff stuff being a dad makes me think of my old man I said damn dude I didn't know what the guy was dealing with I thought it was just kind of like an angry fella every now and again I didn't know I didn't know he was a deeply sexually frustrated man I just let him suffer dude I could have been you know there had been something I could have like at least like wingman Forum dude at dinner it's been sitting at the table and like dude mom dad works pretty hard doesn't he guy works his  ass off man it's like it's like do you want me to do the dishes you guys should watch a movie or something yeah man a new dad's only Solace there's the occasional the occasional pity hand job they're great I mean dude hand jobs are our Flowers By the way when a guy gets a hand job we're like oh my God thank you oh wow women just like phone them in man you guys are like Union laborers all of a sudden like I got 15 minutes come on let's go not supposed to do this  guys get all like do I have do you need lotion it's like yeah that'd be great women rub you guys rub creams and stuff all over your bodies when it comes time to give a hand job it's like you're weighing fentanyl you're like is that enough the little there's sparks flying off my dick I'm like yeah it's  awesome rule of thumb if you can't hear it it's not enough sound like wet shoes specifically that's your target  that's not all about dads women go through it too moms go through it it's terrifying watching a woman be pregnant Jesus I'm so happy I don't have to do that that  sucks dude you just you're a sweet wife dude she's like six months pregnant she's like how do I look and you're like like a  thing's grown inside of you look like a freak can't say that that's the thing when you're with a guy you got to make sure he's not like a squeamish guy if your guy's squeamish he's not going to make it through the pregnancy kick him out dude my wife got so lucky because like like women are already you know self-conscious enough when they get pregnant it's like everything's changing they need to look to you to be a rock you can't Flinch at any of it like dude my my wife the poor  thing would get these blogs she's like oh this

and a threshold of the door I was invite me and just say the words I looked at her I was like she was like you would do that I was like I thought you'd never ask get out of the  way yeah cause it's crazy because like the milk you have to like stimulate it like it will eventually let down so I was just on those things like a little suckling dude I was on there like um she's like oh my God the milk's letting down I was like okay just let me know when I backed off and jerked your nipple off ew it got it got off get me a towel  no I'm kidding I took it to the Dome dude I jammed I was like

it easier than men just there's one and it's trancing can we be honest I feel like a woman becoming a man Cakewalk compared to a guy becoming a girl that's a journey dude foreign all kinds of  impossible beauty standards it's not fair for us dude all a woman has to do to become a man is just buy like one flannel throwing a shitty haircut and we're like what's up brother  welcome I would never trans I'm being honest I have nothing against it I just it's not for me I know I know myself I know if I did it I wouldn't do it for the right reasons that's why I don't do it I would use it like I'd use it it'd be a power thing like if I trans I would do it I would like become the most beautiful woman possible and then I would find like anyone who's ever bullied me and I'd blow them I   it I blow them and halfway through pop up like it's me ha ha ha ha ha who's gay now dude  I'd be like uh us I guess we're gay  all right uh dang but now women have it women have it tough man you know I have daughters now so I'm looking up women's issues I'm I'm trying to Champion them you guys got a lot of stuff going on I've noticed I went on Google the other day came across a gender pay Gap I was Furious I just stopped I was like women have been getting paid 20 less for a hundred years for the same job as men that's ridiculous dude that's unacceptable dude women are bad enough with their money as it is we can't we can't do that it took you guys 100 years to figure out you're getting paid 20 less you dumbasses I'm a dad now this is tough love listen up ladies come on I've read an article they said it's gonna take 437 years to fix the gender wage Gap I saw that I was like girl math easily it's gonna take like 400 years it's like no it's not you're good you could fix it tomorrow literally all you have to do if you're a girl you're at an interview they slide you your job offer look at it poker face and go of the boy salary please slide it right back and if they give you  just pop out a flannel and button it up like we're so sorry sir we have no idea yeah I'm a pretty good guy I'll be honest love my kids I rescued my dogs that was heroic yeah man I mean yeah oh please please yeah keep going keep it up all right hold on I'll be honest I'll be honest I'll be honest it was a bit of a financial decision I was looking at boxer puppies on Craigslist for like 800 bucks and I was like yeah let me see what's up with those autistic pit bulls down there let me head down to dog Walmart and see if I can't get a deal dude when you rescue dogs they make you fill out like 40 pages about yourself I had to fill out this big booklet I got two pages into it and I stopped and I ate it I'm like hey why do I have to fill all this stuff out it's like we have to make sure you're gonna give it a good home it's like aren't you guys going to kill it isn't that the whole business model you guys are gonna murder this dog right so let me just let me take it did you ever ask him how they do it I asked him I was like what do you guys got like a little Snoopy house with the guilty and how do you guys feeling   blow them up I don't I don't know how they do it maybe they use  this pack of tennis ball with C4 he's like go get it buddy huh  I'll be honest I didn't you know I didn't realize that when you rescue dogs when you get them from that place they're like mentally traumatized and like  up I didn't know I brought my dogs right from the place to a dog park my bad that was my bad I let him in I didn't know I opened the gate my one dog ran in there like who the  been talking  and just nailed another dog it was a big deal the owner picked their dog up like I'm pretty sure you guys should leave now and it's like dude my dog won I don't know I don't know people love telling you they rescued dogs man I see bumper stickers about I saw a bumper sticker recently I was behind a car in traffic and the bumper sticker said I didn't rescue my rescue dog my rescue dog rescued me it's like dude call your parents man just call they'd love to hear from you just call them up it's like we're in traffic I'm like dude this sucks enough now I'm thinking about your life my rescue dog rescued me that's like the weirdest way to tell everyone behind you you've seriously considered killing yourself before like I rescued you from what myself all right yeah I'm kind of weird about dogs man you know I'm joking around about blowing them up and stuff like people don't like that and I get it I get that but here's the thing I have like a little void within me about dogs it's like an emotional block because like when I was younger my my dad would always put our dogs down but like just a little too early monster someone dies and they're 99 you're like yeah  good you know whatever it'd be like if they were like 70. he just liked the new model I don't know I can't there was a time one time we went to go put our dog down it was a little Jack Russell I was like nine years old I'm holding at the back of the car I'm like I'm gonna miss you so much her name is Maggie I'm like Maggie I'm gonna miss you so much my dad's like all right we're here wait in the car I'll be right back he came back like 10 minutes later just threw the dog in my lap he's like that vet's a  come on we're out of here don't get attached we're getting a second opinion parents are good people though man my parents honestly are they're like they told me a lot about life man they're very hard working they're kind they're very salt of the earth they're very like they're wonderful people but like dude here's the thing you don't realize how much your parents have in terms of book smarts until you get like a little bit older like it did first and second grade they'd help me with my homework they're just like dude circle square red blue and I was like this guy's a  Wizards man this is crazy but then I remember around like fourth grade math they'd start being like no you got it you go help them to be fair the problem was one half divided by one-fourth I was sitting there I was like Dad I don't understand he was like  how hard can it be it's fourth grade they got you dividing fractions it's like aren't they already divided it's like that's what I'm saying and he had a good idea he goes go to the back of the book they keep the answers back there all right here we go flip to the back of the book it's one half divided by one-fourth the answer is two we just looked at each other like right on for sure it has like went outside and played I was like what the  was that it's one thing to have your your parent confused by the question but to also be mystified by the answer is tough it's tough dude though to be fair to him dude I still don't understand if you have one half of a pizza and you divide it by one-fourth of a pizza you get two brand new fresh hot delicious pizzas delivered to your door in under 30 minutes or less no yeah man my uh my parents sent me to a Catholic grade school which was fantastic another great move Catholic grade school in the 90s was weird because I think they were still figuring out how to do it like all my teachers they were all women they didn't hire any dudes it was all women teachers who cried five times a day these ladies would just start crying they're like hey they start crying I'm like a little kid being like Look Linda everyone's 30s are tough we're gonna figure this out personally I think you should be fired if you cry as a teacher more than three times three strikes I just I have no I have no patience for that man like dude I couldn't I couldn't see a group of kids getting to me like that I would destroy them be like I'm a loser okay yeah  oh well yeah that's why I made twenty seven thousand dollars last year dude let's be beeping my mom's car out the window I'm like yeah that's basically mine right there yeah I went from there to an all boys Catholic High School and Jesus Christ that was worse I went from crying ladies to senile priests when priests lose their minds it's like do they go pure Da Vinci Code it is so scary these guys are fully losing their minds we'd be sitting in class and they were just we this one guy's name is father mukluk just fire him based on the name it's like no he was nuts dude he he stopped class one time he was just we're sitting there you know we're learning he was like boys if you're going to masturbate we're all like we just quit dude we're all we're all in a patch dude we're cold turkey it's like boys if you're gonna masturbate make sure you look at yourselves in the mirror and don't think about girls this was Spanish class Bible I was like and then the next day he came in he's like boys if you're gay you go to hell it's like dude you try to  us yesterday man which is it that used to scare me when I was little on the priest would be like if you're gay you go to hell I was always like I was a little kid man I didn't know I had two older brothers all they did was call me gay I for a while thought I was going to hell for being bad at video games that was such a terrifying way to picture God as a child like I was trying to like really get a good sense of what God was when I was younger and I was like picturing like a like an aggressive frat bro ruling the universe just some guy staring down on Creation with like a cut sleeve robe just like what the  dude you imagine that guy watching your life that's terrifying just pausing it at the end like dude you let your ex-wife play with your ass in Punta Cana it's kind of gay bro you gotta justify yourself you're like dude I was at the  pool bar he's like oh day drinking  dude going in there yes I'm in yeah people don't really care I feel like about like the you know traditional gay stuff you know gay marriage all that stuff that was a big deal a while ago nobody really cares anymore I think that's a good thing weirdly though there's still like five Bakers down south fighting the fight you know those like cake shop owners who won't make cakes for gay weddings they're like rambos in the woods dude they don't know the war's over that's such a weird arena for that type of thing too like two gay men walk into a cake shop and the owners just  jerking off an icing bag like dude we love  in this cake shop we're not down with that  you guys here let me get back to finishing this sugar dove I'm gonna finish this cake and finger my wife dude it's like get out of my cake shop you guys that's like the gayest way you can be homophobic I don't know here's the thing though here's the thing they do have the constitutional right to deny services to whoever they want and I love the Constitution so it's it's shitty because the Constitution does rule but also it's like make the boys some  cake I feel like here's what I think we should do to solve the problem it's like all right Cake Shop owners they have to make the cake it's in the law you gotta do the cake but they can make whatever cake they want just a seven-tiered layers of hell  just two melting grooms  or whatever I don't know speaking of gay guys I uh I have a food allergy I have a gluten allergy dude it sucks I know it sucks my uncles all give me  they're like you just do this gluten stuff for attention it's like it's like the only attention I get is you guys calling me a  that's I don't want that dude they picked me off I go to family parties I walk in I have my whole family with me like oh  Marsh it's Matt you can't have bread uh do we have any bowls have come in the refrigerator  I'm trying to do a comeback I have nothing I'm like Dad that would be so much calm there's no way you guys  yeah it is it's you know it's weird having a food allergy because like you know people on like weird diets I'll try to recruit you when they find out they're like like my brother was a vegan for a while he's like dude you got to go plant-based he almost had me like I do like the idea of not hurting animals I was like that is pretty compelling but I have a problem where I always see both sides of things so I also kind of dig the idea of killing a creature and absorbing its powers by eating his flesh but for me where I kind of like you know where I Tab out I don't like with vegans I don't like when they eat imitation meat when they eat like soy chicken and tofurkey I don't it's not for me it's just weird man it's like a you're doing the thing you say you don't that's like walking around saying you're not gay and sucking on a dildo that's how I feel then you got to be like I mean yeah technically you're correct but uh that's a very strange choice like no man it's a textural thing it's just there's something to be said for that real dick feel you gotta try it man all right take your word so now I have to go to Whole Foods you know if you have a food allergy you have to go to Whole Foods they have all the stuff you need it's annoying because it's all so expensive the food there is just ridiculous and it's also like a culture shock to go from like a normal Philadelphia grocery store to Whole Foods you go to Whole Foods everyone's all like ah they're all peppy like well hey what's up man like I'm used to like regular cashiers like an Acme just ladies just  slumped and defeated dude just a Grandmom with two big wrist guards on their arms  slug into Deer Park like it's wiping tears off the belt  that's what I'm talking about  you're going to Whole Foods they pick up every item like oh what's this I never had this before it's like of course you have it you're a cashier you can't afford this   the  in the bag everything there is expensive dude everything in Whole Foods is super expensive and the reason why it's kind of a weird reason like every product in Whole Foods is designed to make you feel like you're a good person like everything you pick up a bag of sugar it's like two percent of the proceeds of the sugar go towards some kid in a  up country the kid is so sad it's having such a bad life and his mom's mean to him too and if you buy the sugar we'll give them some shoes maybe and you're like oh that's nice I get all invested I'm like my boys out there you fill your cart with all this stuff you're like dude I am a good guy let me go check out and you see the sales tax you're like ah that goes towards bombs for that same kid dang it foreign  I'm like yeah maybe we'll get the shoes first that'd be nice you know I can pilot flies away from decimating a village like you see the moccasins on that kid oh it's nice to know there's it is weird that products are designed now to like make us feel certain ways morally that's a I don't know man that's like when the like the medieval Church used to sell indulgences where like you could buy your way into heaven that's what it feels like to me it's it's kind of creepy and it's funny because like no one knows this dude the first company to do this was Stouffer's they did this years ago I think I was the only one who noticed Stover said this thing it said let's fix dinner that was the whole campaign they didn't do anything they just put a fact on all their boxes of food the fact was families we eat together more than five nights a week or fifty percent less likely to have children who abuse drugs and alcohol that was it you just go yeah okay sure it's got nothing to do with Stouffer's like if your mom's at home microwaving your dinner five nights a week there's a good chance that she does drugs and alcohol dude yeah man it's tough it's tough for the information man you don't know you don't know what's what I get tricked all the time I constantly get tricked or  a while back I was I was in a vulnerable point in my life and I saw this article about microdosing and dude honestly it's it's cool but like the way it was presented was misleading it was like there was this thing it was like Silicon Valley executives are taking a little bit of LSD and a little bit of mushrooms and crushing it in the boardroom I saw that and I was all like am I not high enough at work I thought I was thought it was pretty high the hell and then I had like a temp job at the time so you know I took a little mushrooms in the morning and they called me like hey we don't need you today so I was just in my room like am I crushing it I can't tell I'll tell you it doesn't work for sure is macro dosing weed edibles and working for your father for five years that's not it's not the way that was tough man my dad does construction so we'd be in like a trench I'm running a tamper like Dad do you think worms are ticklish see my father be physically disappointed as  I feel like you when I grow up he's like dude you're 32. I I don't know I don't know but yeah that period of my life that wasn't a total waste of time honestly I was basically I was high for my entire 20s I was just stoned all the time and I like I did learn some stuff I learned some Secrets I think I think I learned I learned some Secrets dude I learned how to drive by the way I can be so stoned and drive no problem I'm not saying you guys do it but like I can tell you how if you wanna if you want to know if you guys might be high right now you're gonna drive home you gotta do what you gotta do here's if you're way too high to drive here's all you do just  you just look at the road signs and you do exactly what they say I think that's what they're there for you see 35 miles an hour you're like strapping in there we go no turn on red I wouldn't dream of that that's yeah man you got to be careful online man I always you know I try to like keep my YouTube algorithm clean of all the political stuff because that'll get me riled up and I like to watch YouTube to fall asleep at night I just watch videos it just helps me pass out but even like sometimes like that you think the safest video people still get in like we do this thing where like everyone's stepping on each other's necks to be like I'm a good person this person  sucks and like we're running out of people to do it too now so now it's just like dude I watched a video on Benjamin Franklin totally safe this will be cool it's like a 10 minute video all those like diplomatic missions and inventions the top rated comment was some lady like yeah he was a piece of  womanizer he cheated on his wife just  nuts I'm like that's what you're going after colonial era infidelity that's all right  ruining my night but so now I'm making a case for abandoning my head I'm like yeah yeah he cheated on his wife they covered it in the movie by the way they didn't lie I'm like he also invented electricity imagine if it was always dark after 6 pm and then it wasn't because of you ever see Benjamin Franklin's wife beat b as hell it wasn't her fault all the women back then they didn't have vitamins their oldest  they all had those big thick truck driver forearms from constantly burying their kids that's all they did back then  look it up all the  kids die don't be  that's how it was back then Benjamin Franklin's inventing electricity his wife's just at home just burying quadruplets just hitting the Frosted ground like I can't even right now I hate Mondays comes home he's like babe you'll never believe this she's like grab a shovel Ezekiel Four's down we gotta get in the ground  it is funny Ben got caught because like dude he was taking a boat to France before the internet and just  ladies and he was like no one will ever know about this and then he   bragged in one letter and we're like oh got him  got him Divine  was the bomb   got him that was a shitty time period to live man a couple hundred years ago dude dude that was like so tough man dudes would just die like there was guys whose lives would consist of them just walking in the woods one day and twisting their ankles and just laying there for two weeks like oh then they die that was it 'd be a family of 14 kids the dad would go out to get firewood just like  himself to death it would get cold they don't sit there like dead I like to take my modern problems and I filter them through like would this have mattered 300 years ago it doesn't work I still obsess over the dumbest stuff it doesn't do anything for me but it's a cool thing to think about you know it's like like even dude take our worst thing dude take covid that sucked that was bad could you imagine explaining covet to Benjamin Franklin you might get some perspective like oh dude Ben we got hit with a nasty pandemic he's like oh I got the little ones but yeah more like our 80 year olds he's like you guys have 80 year olds holy  man that's great well it also hit the obese pretty bad too he's like what the  the obese man then you get defensive you're like I heard you cheated on your wife actually let's talk about that let's focus on that scumbag he's a piece of  for that I would never cheat on my wife man I love her to death man my wife took me in at a bad time dude I was a divorcee I was scandalized that's tough to re-enter the dating field when you're when you're divorced man it's hard dude you know because like you just you get divorced you just shatter your soul into a million pieces then you have to just eventually go on dates you feel just like a blown out vet all right I guess I'm going back you're gonna  Bennigan's with some lady and she's like and that's when I discovered nursing was my passion you're like  ah it was weird too because like you know my wife when we were dating initially I had been married and she had never been married before so that's like an awkward Dynamic that it that feels like like you're watching a movie with someone where like you've seen the movie and they haven't you know you're out in the beginning they're like this is great you're like yeah wait do you see the end it's pretty sad and  up it's pretty bad actually you know it's not that big if you clap it up your parents are divorced it's not that big of it I'll clap it up right now there we go yeah yeah man yeah man my parents are still together sorry about your parents that's a shame so but no one would clap foreign is anyone engaged by the way is there any engagements  hey yo there's the man right there you did you do the engagement photos oh it's the best seeing your friend look like a huge  on Facebook  you didn't put on a pumpkin like  brother I did it twice don't feel bad man second time's dark dude you're gonna Charlie's Angels pose like I wish it was a real  gun I'd shoot myself why are we in a park    sucks but no man I'm married I love it man I I'm in a really hot interracial relationship you guys know what I'm about my wife's black and I'm Puerto Rican it's pretty sick now I'm white I'm white I'm white it is cool my wife's a black woman she can say like whatever she wants total freedom of speech it's awesome she'll like but she'll drag me into conversations where I have to be like hey I don't know if you know this but white guys are kind of on house arrest right now you go ahead yeah black women can say whatever they want except for Whoopi Goldberg for some reason they're on Whoopi's ass man it annoys me she would apologize recently for using the word gypped yes you'd apologize to the American Gypsy community she had to burn 30 seconds of prime time TV to say sorry to four toothless carnies just some guy fixing a ring toss like that   better take it back   laughs no man my wife will just like dragged me into these conversations where I'm like I don't know I don't know how to respond man it's like like I invited her on a double date not too long ago and it was like a kind of a weird situation as my friend he's a white guy who just started dating this black chick which first of all I'm kind of like that's my thing yeah that's kind of annoying and then it's like you don't want to go on a double interracial date single day is perfect because like you guys like we're saving the world we're so tolerant once you're in like a double interracial date now you're like enthusiasts or something it's  you're swirling a glass like we like what we like you know it's weird but I told my wife the situation I'm like come on man we should go you know we haven't been doing anything let's go on a date my wife was like what kind of black is she level two I don't  know man how to can't possibly answer this I learned about a lot of white stereotypes too being with I I hear stuff I'm not supposed to hear there's a lot of weirdly specific stereotypes about white people you guys probably have no idea about I always like walking on conversations where I hear them and I'm kind of like I just opened my door I walked in on one recently I opened my door my wife was talking to her aunt on speakerphone it's a cultural thing and I I open my door I open my door it's a custom be respectful and I I just opened the door to her aunt being like you know white people don't care about their grandparents and I was like ah damn it dude  that one's true that hurts that's I didn't know anyone knew about that how the hell they know it's true my mom calls me every like five months she's like you know your great aunt Brady died I'm like Mom do I you'd have to go oh my God  all right I have to go literally ID the body at the funeral I go and I'm like oh  that lady uh I hate funerals then you have to like try to like talk to a dead person in your head it's always I just panic I don't know what to say I just like it's just like I just rattle off some  iced tea would say on NCIS and my crime doesn't pay you  punk laughs yes it's fun though man it's cool you know being in a relationship like that I get like having a black life is a confidence booster sometimes certain situations it's like dude like customer service disputes bro black ladies like the Navy Seals of customer services they  it's crazy I always I'm first wave on the scalp I go up I'm like hey I noticed our flight's delayed you know how long that's going to be by chance I'm like sir shut the  up dude sit the  down I'm like all right I always give him another chance I'm like are you sure you'll never guess who's following me up dude  I go I just tell I'm like it was that lady right there she comes back five minutes later with like a 50 gift card she's like we're taking off throwing on the pile yeah it's not all fun and games man we do deal with stuff we still have a race problem in this country you know a lot of perceptual stuff you know like there's just like sometimes you will just be looked at differently and I you know it is what it is like I I here's the thing I bought us a pair of matching sweatpants from Walmart I thought it'd be funny it's not nobody likes it but there's like pattern weird looking sweatpants and like we still have them so sometimes like laundry just works out the way we're we're just out of stuff and we both wear them we don't even think about it we'll be out like running errands in our matching sweatpants and we'll be like like arguing in the electronics department at a Target and I'll see the people looking at us who work there and I know they're thinking we're one of those crackhead couples I know whether they think you know those couples that like walk along the side of the highway together just visibly Bound in failure for all to see just you know those guys they always make me laugh I'm like why the highway what the hell checking Google Maps like I said it's going to take five days and four hours we're gonna take the turnpike come on I love those guys it's like the heroin Oregon Trail you see them out there like God damn Prospectors see their sweatpants catch the wind you're like oh my God it's beautiful yeah we argue it sucks I hate arguing with my wife I wish we didn't what we do we've been together for so long it's like embarrassing at this point you know because we we don't even have anything to argue about our arguments are like they're like abstract they're like philosophical battles at this point they don't even it's like a house like ancient Greece dude we argue like my wife it's like stupid stuff like I'll be downstairs like hey make sure you load the dishwasher before you go to bed tonight and my brain does that thing where it's like delete  control alt delete I don't do it on purpose my mind's just like this other thing's more important than I just thank you I hate that I do that but then the next morning you know it all crashes down on me she's like why didn't you load the dishwasher and I'm like I forgot she's like how did you forget I'm like you want me to explain the absence of thoughts it's a logical fallacy and I want we argue with the toilet seat that's so embarrassing I hate that man just so stupid and cliche that you know yes you all the time and I dude I'll put it down I don't care I'll put it down sometimes I forget you know and I'm like all I'm asking you is just  gently lower it don't slam it like an  just  just put it down is that the end of the world I'm like what's the worst thing that could happen by it being up she's like I could fall in there at night time like what do you run to the bathroom ass first and jump what the  so now I do I put it down every time but I also put that little one too I put that down like  you I dropped that down and I pee on it a little  you can't win arguments with women man they'll just destroy you it's their game you think you win they'll wait like three weeks and just  Lance you it'll be three weeks later she'll be like what's up with your teeth laughs what do you mean she's like oh never mind I'm like what the  they'll get you with their celebrity crushes that hurts man just stop stop doing that man that hurts us we were watching the movie Fury do you ever see Fury World War II movie Brad Pitt army tanks awesome movie we're having a good time we're enjoying it halfway through Brad Pitt pops out of an army tank he just like won a battle he's like yeah his shirt's ripped I'm like yeah how does a shirt get ripped inside of a tank but I'm not ruining it first I'm quiet he pops out of the tank you can see like his stomach my wife didn't even say anything she just went um now I'm watching a whole different movie I'm rooting for the Nazis now I'm Googling  I'm like yeah the economy was pretty  up no one wants to talk about it  but yeah man she's a good girl though she's always trying to get me to come out of my shell you know that's a big thing she's always trying to get me to like kind of open up a lot and you know I appreciate that but like she's always like I want to know like what's your top fantasy I'm like you know I don't I'm old enough I don't want to do anything new it's like you can you take a chance on a fetish you can't go back like there's some out there if you bust that out that's it like sir do you know what cuckolding is you've you familiar with the term do you know what it is ma'am yeah it's when a man burns with a desire to see another man with his woman we're not into it he's  freak dude guys that's an example it's like dude you can't like rewind the clock on that if you set that up if you don't like that that's a problem just some guy just slamming your wife and after like five minutes you're like yeah you know what guys no that's actually not what I like at all hey it's your co-worker like Dave stop Dave it's like breaking up a dog fight like come on get out of there knock it off that'd be terrible man my wife always what's your top I don't know how to tell my wife and my top fantasy at this point is just a woman being nice to me that's all I want that's all I want man my top fantasy right now is we're driving I make a left turn my wife goes where are you going I say it's a new shortcut I figured out and she goes cool oh babe I'm about to turn off the GPS she's like do it I'm like oh my  god yeah but my wife my wife she's you know she's a more bold and kind of outgoing my wife likes role play which is you know I do it obviously I'm a sexually desperate man but  bro it's so weird because she'll just  you know I don't have time to prepare for the role she's just like bam go and I'm like because in order to have sex when you're married before you have sex you have to go out to dinner and eat like a ton of food which most nights it ends up with like two just stuffed people looking at each other going like nah  scrap it we'll do it later but on this night you know the planet's aligned sitting on a couch we're full just grossly making out a married couple just  uh just like two slugs mating just uh try to force blood to our genitals then my wife you know just brings a roll on me she goes you're not going to tell my husband about this are you uh you want me to practice cheating on me with you all right um well your husband's a good man and frankly I he's been a good friend to me and I don't know how I feel about our trust actually ma'am good day and you know no she's like seriously don't ruin this I was like all right fine fine fine so I got into care I got real deep into character dude I grabbed the back of her head and I was like your husband's podcast is so  funny you guys are awesome thank you so much    it's a trip    
Shane Gillis,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgWI8tElZ84,watch Bon do anything I get the same feeling as like you ever go to a friend's house and they have like a 16-year-old dog and it walks in the room and you got to do that hole like oh hey there he is just look at him he's looking great my favorite thing about Biden is any anytime Biden finishes a speech he transforms into a Roomba just tell you this on a more serious not this is something I'm dealing with in my life I just I recently found out that the girl I'm dating her ex is a Navy SEAL that sucks that sucks dick dude that's the worst act of all time I never even thought you want to feel insecure as a man that's the word I never never even thought of that one as like that could happen to me I spent my whole life thinking black eyy worst case on this and by the way I mean that with all due respect to the black community dude for real I wish people feared my dick like that I I wish my dick struck fear in an entire races nobody fears my dick dude nobody fears my dick other than like women in parking garages they you get me in a parking garage all of a sudden my dick's top of the food chain see me lurking behind a pillar in there just just with a GameStop Bag N dude Navy SEAL it's a tough one I do this thing it's not a good thing but whenever whenever I'm dating a girl I always talk  on her ex's it's not a good look women don't respect it kind of makes me look like a  I like it I I can't stop doing and normally it's easy normally it's like what's your ex do he's a  substitute teacher it's weird he wants to hang out with kids like that bad you know like this one's tough this is a tough X to make fun of just want to walk around the apartment all day just  Navy Seals they're kind of  if you really think about it you know what I mean like using night vision sneaking up on guys that's a  coward's way to fight dude you know who's actually Brave Al-Qaeda that that takes courage and bravery St pajamas throwing rocks at tanks heroic  dude just you and your boys going out in flip flops you're all going to get  up no training zero military training dude those guys those dudes they had  they had one set of monkey bars that's what they all trained on and they were proud of the monkey bars you remember that video you've seen them using the monkey bars they were they they filmed themselves using the monkey bars and then sent that tape out to the world like not bad I found this out hanging out with my girlfriend uh I didn't know that women women watch porn now shame sorry I'll say this about that I think women watching porn's having a negative effect on all of us you know what I mean we can't both come into the bedroom thinking we can  like that you  someone lately it say everyone thinks they're in a porn dude everyone every time you  a lady she every dude's like everyone what are we doing stop belly to belly is pretty good it feels the same everyone thinks they're a porn star you're not dude those are professionals you're not good enough to  like that first off if you're a dude and you're good at sex that's gay I hate to break it to you dude that's a girl quality no I'm not I'm not saying it's bad when I'm saying it was bad enough already when it was just men watching Point coming into the bedroom with  ideas from  that you know what I mean it was bad enough when it was just me coming in there just just I watched a squirt tutorial earlier she's like I can't squirt like you all can squirt actually some girl just forces herself to pee to get you to stop doing it it's like you did it baby like yeah obiously I did it now you can't you can't do the cool moves you see in porn just have regular just do regular you don't have to you ever try them you ever think you can you ever try like C in a girl's face not as cool they're a lot less receptive in real life that's that whole process is a  nightmare dude it's a disaster it's just you the girl you loves down there you've been begging her for 3 months to try this finally she's like yeah you can do it you're like yes it's going to be just like the videos I watch every day that's my favorite part now you get to do it you think it's going to be awesome it's not it's just you up there alone it's cold she's out she's being nice she's like are you okay now you can feel it you're like all right here it comes this is going to be awesome she's GNA love this  as soon as it hits him they freeze dude and then once it's on them they like don't know how to move you know what I mean like you ever put like socks on a cat and then you feel bad cuz the com's out of you and you realize what you've done feel terrible you got to  you got to pick her up off the ground like the same energy as like when a toddler Falls like come here get up you're right you're all right you're all right we'll never do it   again n he    I missed the Trump speeches Trump gave what I think was probably one of the greatest speeches of world leaders given you know it's got to be up there with like Churchill gettysburger dress anyway for real though it was my favorite speech I've ever seen a president give it was the night was the night the United States killed the leader of Isis Trump comes out of the Situation Room at like midnight in the white house and he walks down that  tunnel like he's and gives a press conference like he's given a postgame NBA just killed a guy press conference he walks up in front of the entire world at midnight and just goes Abu outbag daddy is dead he died like a dog and that's all him dude I didn't change one word of that that's what he opened with and then he did 40 minutes the speech is 40 minutes for no reason it wasn't a prepared speech he freestyled 40 straight not even a speech just mean  talk for 40 the meanest  talk you've ever heard in front of the whole world Abu we could hear him crying I said Abu don't cry AB let me tell you something Abu cried he cried quite a bit I wouldn't have cried Cry Baby Back daddy that's what we were all calling look I love everything about that speech I love it I love thinking about Trump in The Situation Room surrounded by generals watching aive mil Watching Special Forces watching those  Navy Seals those mother if I was in there I'd be like get out of there IO run they're great lovers don't let them get you ah they got them they're making him squirt no no how could you do this  that's what we should do instead you know instead of Zero Dark 30 killing these guys we should break in and have our special forces  whack them off in their own bed that sounds a pretty serious message dude you imagine that just four Navy Seals holding your arms and legs you're the only dude without night vision no queer they fly away on a helicopter you just got jerked off in your own bed you  jerk me off you make me do come I me anyway yeah dudes with Down Syndrome love women so much that like I've never been a believer of being gay is a choice but I will say every dude I know that can't think  loves  all right I guess it's a keeper  all right that's that's the end of that that's where that should end look I was talking ear I'm not I'm not a republican yet but I will say I just want to see like for real I don't care if they arrest him if he loses the primary I don't get let him debate dude let him debate all I want to see is in debate dude Okay Hand yo if he if he gets arrested elector him out to the  just bring him on stage here's my idea final debate of the year have one Republican candidate one Democrat be like all right fellas surprise third guest tonight  Stone Cold music the glass shatters he walks out just they're both gay I mean see how they handle that I think it is actually important to see how the candidates handle that type of pressure of debating with Trump dude cuz so far none of them have been able to handle it he literally bull every debate he just bullied whoever was up there the only one who did pretty good in the debates against him was Biden just cuz he had no  idea what was being said which actually helped him that worked out for him cuz Trump's whole thing is he tries to get in the other guy's head dude you can't get in Joe's head Joe's not in there good luck dude Biden Biden is Trump's cryp Tonite in a debate he's literally perfect he can't beat him cuz Trump's so Trump tries to drag the other guy into like a shitalking contest where he will win he will win at that he can't get Biden he tries every every debate he's trying so hard and Biden's just he tries he just you're a loser your son did crack and Biden's just what like right damn dude that's actually a pretty good comeback you might win this thing I miss it I miss the speeches with Trump you remember that we used to get we used to get five speeches a day when he was in office anytime you turn on the TV that guy was giving another  speech live dude be in front of a helicopter scream calling a lady a lesbian or something this is going to be a tough one to defend at work but I'm going to now it's sad now with Biden we get like one speech every three months and it's hard he like Falls and  it's hard to watch it's sad I'm rooting for the guy obviously I want things to go well but it's hard to watch him do anything anytime I watch bidon do anything I get the same feeling as like you ever go to a friend's house and they have like a 16-year-old dog and it walks in the room and you got to do that whole like oh hey there he is just look at him he's looking great my favorite thing about Biden is any anytime Biden finishes a speech he transforms into a Roomba just
Shane Gillis,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKUpf1Vx0vs,everybody i was thinking about the first time like congress had to come up with age of consent that'd be like the powdered wigs and stuff that had to be a rough day for the fellas it's like some guy coming up first like from rhode island 12 and i was like ew ew no dude i don't know why i have to go first on this one it's like the hardest one to go first on  she's talking      this is exciting i was a little too excited i panicked and got this haircut what an insane  up my hair was fine it was totally fine and then two days ago i was like i gotta i gotta salvage this it's crazy that i thought the hair like my hair was i was like if i fix my hair i'll look good like that was the final piece of the puzzle for me there's a dominican barber shop by my house in new york i think i'm the first white guy that's ever been in there i was basically christopher columbus of this barber shop and they  me up dude don't get if you're white don't get a dominican haircut you end up just looking more racist it was nice though he kept trying to reassure me the whole time he was like no man's your head's good kept saying your head is good i was like oh thank you whatever  this haircut how are you guys   it's good it's good i'm happy it's nice everybody's back inside all that  i don't know i had a good i'd like to go i had a nice time i live in new york so i left i went back to my parents house because i have white privilege  some people didn't get to leave the city i did because of my privilege and i used it you got to use it you know what i mean does it feel more disrespectful to waste it you know what then we're all just being racist for nothing  but no it's good i went home my parents haven't lived with them in over 10 years they got old they're old as  they've milked though i'm back on milk been  crushing milk lately i got  milk fat this year it's a weird time in life to have a milk renaissance it's 33. it was nice i think my favorite part of the year was i i got to watch my dad watch the news it's a rough year for my dad and the news he's a fox news guy don't do that it's fine also i see you guys most of you have fox news dads how dare you deny your fathers that's a good dad i don't watch fox but that's a good fox news mom that's fat you don't want fox news mom that's a bad mom she smokes in the house but a fox news dad that's a good  dad can you imagine if you had a  msnbc dead there's some guy every night at dinner like we need to start focusing on renewable energy it's like it's like ew dude i didn't know dad was gay talking to me about solar panels like a  lady he might have her straight as hell dude we  hate the environment that's how straight we are all we talk about is eating  and fracking we hate nature we go fishing we don't even eat fish do we just catch him and  no he's good he likes spot he watches fox he watches it every night like every fox news dead my dad watches fox every night until he can't that's how long they watch they watch every night until they get so angry they have to go to bed my dad will watch for like two hours and then out of nowhere he'll just stand up and be like  mr potato heads trans i'm going to bed this world's going to hell he's all about it dude he loves it like every fox news that my dad watches fox with one goal he's just trying to get one fact that's all he's doing he's sitting there he's trying to retain one piece of information that he can then relay to whoever's unlucky enough to enter the living room while he's watching and you think it'd be easy to get one fact but every once in a while there's like a commercial for like a commemorative 911 gold coin just  wipes their hard drive what was i watching i gotta get one of those i got my hands on those patriotic coins  my dad drinks too so he can never he can never get a fact ever he'll come in the living room we'll be he's hammered watching the news every night which is the wildest way to take in world politics like just hammered on a in a recliner like whoa it's like footage of rocket attacks in israel he's like whoa what the hell are they doing over there what's this guy's problem but he can never get a fact like he tries he tries he's he he uses fox news as like a power point for what he's trying to say like everyone like we'll be eating dinner and like hannity will be saying something he's like see that that's what i meant look at that that's me talking i can't say it that good he can never get a fact you'll walk in the living room he's been watching the news for three hours he'll be like all right what's going on in the world he's like do you want to know i'll tell you  nancy pelosi is a all  all right settle down dude that was the news last that's the news every night from my dad they're just like breaking did you know nancy pelosi is a  i had a feeling but he likes everything they say he agrees with he's all in i realize like fox news is basically black church for old white dudes you know i mean like literally everything they say my dad just said say like yes preach tucker every once while he gets hit with the holy spirit while he's watching it the holy ghost visits him he's just like oh lord build a wall can i get a wall he needs a wall my dad needs a wall for a guy who lives in central pennsylvania securing the southern border it's like oddly important to him i don't know what he's worried about like he's going to lose his job you know like some guy from honduras is going to walk the whole way to pennsylvania just slam her resume down on my dad's boss's desk so you're here for the sales position stay quiet also there i was just at the border of arizona and mexico there's a wall i had no idea i got down there i saw the wall i was like holy  he built it they were like no it's been here it's been here for like a century you got to tell my dad i'm  him up he gets fired up every night it's a crazy way to go to bed every night just  so there's apnea mask on  every night you  caravan dude you walk in the living room in my house right now my dad he'd hit you like southern borders of mess right it's crazy but i make fun of him for it and then i i do the exact same thing just with my phone every night i just look at my phone until i can i'm like  mr potato that's it every day i just get on read opinions from people i know are dumb like in person i know they're dumb i've talked to them i'm still reading their twitter their political opinions it's great and my my twitter is crazy it's it's half where i'm from which is the middle of pennsylvania so it's it's white trash and then half now all now i live in new york so it's crazy like all you know i still have uncles they all just got twitter they're all  fired up they're having fun dude they all have like zero followers they just tweet into the void they love it dude they do it for the love of the game like panera was good today this is on to a server that'll outlast civilization and then now all my new friends are literally communists from brooklyn so it's wild dude my social like i'll get on i'll get on twitter and the first tweet i see will be someone from back home that's just like  colin kaepernick better stand up like this tweet if you support the police share it if you're not gay and then the next post is just one of my new woke white friends that's just like i'm not racist that's it  every day for the last year just a different white person popping up like look at me look at this article i shared to my instagram story i'm not racist right it's like all right are you sure i don't know if you know this like being racist isn't like a yes or no thing you know i mean it's not like you have it or you don't have it like being racist is more it's like being hungry you know it's like yeah you're not right now you know it's like yeah you're not hungry right now but a cheeseburger could cut you off on the highway you get hungry we're hungry all day  the cheeseburger is jewish in that joke no okay cheeseburgers whatever whatever type of cheeseburger you thought it was in your racist heart  anyway  that's it i just get online read opinions from people the news like other news is kind of like this is the most divided this country has ever been say with the like the red states and the blue states it's like why because we tweet at each other you know we had a war right you know this country had a civil war that was pretty divided like at least nowadays we're communicating with each other back then those guys never they got the news like once a month some guy would come by on a horse and they were like who's talking  the guy was like the south is talking   that i don't like that give me my gun i'm gonna go down there i'm gonna walk i'm gonna walk down there for a month straight shoot the first  guy i see down there the civil war was basically just the north just shooting racism out of the south that's what happened the north was like south  chill and the south was like no so a bunch of guys had to walk down there and shoot them a lot and they're like all right we'll let them go or not to be nice to them for a while until we find out they're good at football and then roll tides  hey raw damn time i don't like i don't like alabama football i watched i just watched this documentary on alabama football it's great it's about well it's not i don't know i don't know if you should say it's great but it's about it's about album football it's about when they desegregated their football team so up until this point alabama football was just wide all right and everybody down there was pumped on that they would pack the stadium everyone would be like look at all those whites running around catching it hey look i'm not knocking them too hard because i still have a little bit of that in me you know like if a white guy catches the ball on sunday i'm like oh  go go go go go go ah they got him they got him it's a tough run a smart run head's up run there but no they took it too far and uh so the documentary focuses on that it focuses on bear bryant bear bryant legendary head coach he was the head coach that brought the first black players onto the team so the whole documentary is like celebrating bear bryant they're like  way to go bear you did it what a hero and then you find out it was 1971 yeah well a little late for high fives on this one fellas holy  71 like we had been to the moon there were literally people on the moon before alabama had black eyes in their secondary  does anyone understand there were white corners white cornerbacks you understand how preposterous that is some of some of you are too young to have ever even seen a white corner they're extinct they don't exist there there's two left at the san diego zoo they won't reproduce you'll never see a white corner but that's what happened it wasn't like the reason they desegregated the team it was that's what the documentary focuses on which is great because it wasn't like oh hey fellas it's 1971 maybe we should get with the times what happened was alabama scheduled usc southern cal alabama was confident they're like oh white boys will take on anybody and then usc came down to alabama with a bunch of black dudes from l.a just beat the  out alabama and then after the game bear bryant gave like a speech and he was like hey y'all come on that was it that's all it took everybody down there was like yeah we get it we'll be less racist if it means we can win what that's what it is like as big as racism is in america football that's true that's true look the goat there's a disney movie remember the titans dedicated to what i just told you the whole point of that dude that was one high school football season remember the titans was like it was eight weeks you know that whole town went from like centuries of like don't let them in our school to just like oh  the high school team's 4-0 those are my brothers  all right i'll get off the topic the point look the point i'm trying to make the point i'm trying to make is if you want to get rights in america you just gotta put together a good football team you know what i mean like if the transgenders if the transgenders got together and put together just a  hard nose run it down your throat ball club the transit just three yards of the cloud dust of transgenders if the trans if the trans community could just somehow upset alabama everybody down there tomorrow would be like those are some tough  actually right  all right we got out of that there's some rough patches in there that's all right well this won't go great either uh  you know how like every show and movie now it's like a remake of something they just remake an old thing and just make it like more progressive and just put it out like they remade they remade ocean's 11 like a heist movie with like all gorgeous women that movie should have been 10 minutes long they literally should have got to the casino and just blown the security guards they've all here's the keys to safe take everything i love you you guys you crazy  i love you  i just that's it that's all they make they either make that or they make like they make slavery movies every year those are for no one i have black friends i was like dude you guys do you guys like these they're like no we thought you got these were for you like no we all hate those stop making them it's uncomfortable civil rights movies are good though i like like uh like judas and the black messiah was sick remember the titans is great hidden figures was the movie about the black ladies at nasa or as my dad likes to call it medea goes to the moon look that was him that said that he said that as soon as he said i was like what did you  say you don't talk like that so every movie is just remade is more progress i just think it'd be funny if like the right started remaking you know i mean if they just start like conservatives like there's a new scooby-doo coming out and it'd be funny if like the right remade it it's just like scooby and the gang going around ripping the wigs off of transgender people it's like that's not a woman some guy i would have got away with it we solved the case of the starbucks ghoul  has enough time passed that we can can we admit that trump was funny can we finally admit that he was funny well hold on i don't i don't like the tone of that that's not what i'm going for here yeah the great leader he was funny now whether or not that's a great quality for the commander-in-chief that's definitely up for debate but he was funny i saw it  and i lived in new york so the whole time he was in office i would be like you know something would happen i'd show my friends like look at that they'd be like what it's funny okay there's nothing funny about donald trump i don't i don't know during hurricane dorian he was like maybe we should nuke it like that was that was a real suggestion from the president the president said that the president of the united states he was like hey we got a big storm coming you guys want me to blow it up and i was like no what the  are you talking about i don't know i  around dude that's what i do i don't know now that he's gone i'll never like i'll never watch a debate ever again can you imagine like just a regular debate now after we went like we witnessed the goat undefeated in debates and he never said a fact you know how impressive that is he was funny and he argued like a fifth grader he was unstoppable people tried to hit him with statistics and facts he would just go wrong holy  dude how is no one prepared for this go back and watch those debates you forget how how good how electric that  was don't tell your friends in austin they'll be mad just get a six-pack toss on a trump highlight video on youtube it's a good night dude why i went back i watched his first debate that's like my favorite one at the time trump was pulling it like less than one percent like he was no one liked him if you guys like him now you did it back then and i know that because my dad i watched my dad my dad at the time he would like any time trump even came on tv my dad was like get this  joker get him off the  screen and then now my dad's like  guys can't go to the capitol he's like guys can't have fun anymore it was because of the debates that's what did it do that's how we got trump these debates and the first one is the best one so it's a republican primary everyone's up on stage and they're all still doing their political  so like the first couple guys that talk are like i'm from kentucky and i love education and the crowd's like nice we didn't know what was coming then the next guy's like i'm from georgia and i love religion the crowd's like pretty good this is a good one it was a heated debate and then i finally got to trump's turn to talk and he was just like rand paul is ugly and the whole crowd was like oh we didn't know you could do that in this you can just do that as your thing and rand paul was like all right everybody settle down we're trying to have a debate here and the whole crowd was like shut the  up rand paul ugly  and we just kept throwing dorks up on stage to make him debate trump it was not fair it was mean for us to have done that to people these guys were in politics their whole lives and they just had to debate a  maniac up there who didn't give a  dude and i hated he was fun to cheer for him in the debates it was fun to cheer for him in the debates because he dude he was going up against guys that had been in politics for like 40 years and then he showed up to the event like oh  it what are we talking about he had no clue every week he had no  idea there's one debate there's one debate he's like in the middle of it going back and forth about the economy with ted cruz they're literally talking about the economy and in the middle of it he's just like ted's wife ugly as a dog holy  dude ted was like i'm from texas you don't talk about a man's family like that you've got a dog wife ted everyone knows   yeah and a week later ted cruz was on tv like i support donald j he's like you  i will say this the one thing that sucked about trump losing was for me was because i just figured out kind of how to do his voice that's kind of a bummer that i just it's not hard to do trump it's very all you have to do that just do that do that a second off from where it should be in the sentence and then all you like you don't have to sound like him all you have to do is like get his cadence down it's very easy all you have to do is like describe something and then say you described it that way that's it it's every time like what a big room this is i walked in here i said wow what a big room that's it every time  austin a lot of homeless i walked in here i said wow that's a lot of homeless you guys got it you got a lot of homeless you gotta what are you guys doing about it whatever you guys are doing is not working so cheap switch i don't know what to do either but do something a lot of tense  why it's been making me laugh thinking about trump like not understanding why people are homeless i walked out i saw him i said why are you living in tents i could never these guys but i will say this about trump i don't want you guys to get i don't want to turn this into a rally i will say this so don't freak out just listen i will i think it's fair to say that of all the presidents we've had i think it's fair to say that trump would have been the funniest one to see get shot you know dude the patriots got fired up on that dude i was having fun at this show no look i didn't even say it would be funny i said funniest it's a huge difference technically there's the funniest of everything there is it doesn't make it funny but there is like think of the worst thing you can think of there's a funniest one i'll go first i'll think of one school shooting none of those are funny zero funny but maybe there was one where like the horse girl in the class like could sense something was coming you know i mean they're like what's wrong and she was like   but back to what i was saying about if you had what i said was true if you had to rank them from least funny to funniest assassination easy number one really he'd be talking  like when it happened he'd be doing like a rally my opponent's gay i walked in i saw him i said wow this guy's gay the shooter would be coming out be like sit down you're gay get hit he'd definitely make a funny noise into the like he'd get hit back you fall funny i will say i did i did write that joke before biden could be added to the rankings i don't think he would be the funniest but the only reason biden might be the funniest is because i think biden's the first president you could punch assassinate you know what i mean just walk right through the metal texas big mr president the  are you doing dude it's a body shop  i'd add that joke  my dad's he can't be talking about killing presidents what about body music my dad's he's a good good guy he's an alcoholic but he's good he's like a good he's a good alcoholic he's not hurting anybody but everyone's he's always has an excuse while he's drinking that's what's funny about it like he can never just get hammered and be like yeah i got  up like it's always like you'll see him on like a monday you'll be like damn it's monday you're getting  up he's like it's  it's monday night football have a couple of drinks geez you'll see him on like a tuesday you'll be like damn it's tuesday you're getting  up he's like it's  there's no football  what the hell and my sister does heroin and uh and that one we're like you do need to you know you need to stop doing that which sucks for her because if she played guitar everybody would be like instead she's a hairdresser so it's not as cool relax it's my family it's my family don't worry about it actually based on this crowd i'm sure it's actually a lot of your guys families and that's all right we're allowed to talk about it my sister since she was doing heroin we had to have a intervention for her she lived out in pittsburgh we live in the middle of pennsylvania so we had to trick her to come home you got to trick him i don't know if you know these guys they're not just  stopping by they're very busy they're the busiest people they get a bad rap for being lazy because they take a lot of naps but if they're awake they're  very busy they're scurrying around dude doing quests that's what they do if you do heroin long enough you run out of money you got to start doing quests you know it's you know it's like a  up game of zelda every day you just wake up to a new quest it's like you need to gather coppers gonna find a scrap yard it sounds nice i wish i got quests but eventually the quests get pretty dark scrapyard that's like level one towards the end the quest you need to get titty  behind the home depot  it's when it's time for a change so we had to come up with a plan to trick her to come home for the intervention the plan we came up with was we told her that we had won tickets to go to six flags and it worked she called back she's already all right i'll be there just got on the first bus it's like a seven hour bus ride there's nothing to them dude no if you take heroin every bus is a bullet train it's a five minute ride tops anyway so the plan was pick my sister up from the bus stop not take her to six flags they could take her to a hotel where we're gonna have an intervention i didn't want to start the intervention with like a lack of trust so i took her to six flags the day of her intervention the more that day she and i went to six flags together and i thought that was a nice gesture but it turns out intervention is supposed to be rock bottom you know what i mean like intervention's supposed to be the worst day of your life not like you're tired from easily the best day humanly i mean she took heroin and rode roller coasters it was dude it was impossible we sat down with you better  change your life she's like i'm going back tomorrow  and i was with her she was she was  up if you know anyone from pittsburgh you know what she was wearing she was wearing a steelers jersey and pajama pants steelers pajama pants she dusted off her finest heinz ward for the occasion  so we get in there there's a water park there we didn't know they added that we haven't been there since we were kids we get in there there's one of those water slides it's just like a  straight drop like no sides on it no raft just by yourself she looks at it she's like i wanna go up on that one i was like yeah all right yeah  it you know i knew she was going to rehab like that night so i was like yeah get this one in you're gonna you're about to have a rough couple months here this is gonna be also i figured they would stop her she was wearing a steelers jersey and pajama pants trying to get on a water slide all they did was make her take her  crocs off her yellow crocs so she's climbing up this ladder she gets to the top of this  giant water slide you know how like when it's your turn next on a water ride you got to like lay there in that water and like wait to go she she nodded off she took a nap up at the top like a dracula laying in front of some high school lifeguard that's like uh ma'am it's your turn uh he just sent her down due to sleep just flying down this thing dude she there's a ramp at the end she hit her we all got to watch her wake up in air she did the whole  you know i don't know how that wasn't  rock bottom so you woke up in air anyway don't be sad about it she's good she did go to rehab and that's good yeah she's done she stopped using it she's sober she's all good two years clean yeah yeah yeah it's good she did uh she did get cancer though so and covered cancer and covered

off with volleyball shorts on little kids it's weird it's gross dude just get them gym shorts that's all no dude it's gross because then you know it's just me and the other uncles up in the up in the bleachers kind of making eye contact with each other bro are you seeing this  such a funny way to just destroy a show just right at the very end be like aren't kids hot yo give it up for trump aren't kids hot no i am i truly am serious about the gym shorts though it's weird and so i got home from this  volleyball match my roommate his girlfriend played college volleyball so i'm very excited to like  on volleyball whenever i can so i get in there and i was like yo volleyball is  that's a weird culture get them  shorts get them gym shorts the shorts they're wearing is gross and she was like no we need those shorts for speed on the court and i was like uh i know that's not true i watched the nba none of you are moving as fast as like a ref and those guys are wearing like slacks dress shoes for some reason she was like no we need those shorts the tight shorts they're essential she compared him to like a helmet in football i was like i know they're not essential because i googled the uh the special olympics volleyball team  all of a sudden those shorts weren't so essential for them what's that about  how baggy do you think they're they look like the  n1 mixtape out there offensively baggy is how i would describe all of their attires  we're all adults we can this we all agree the special olympics is a good it's a good program i just it's great i just feel like the guy who came up with it had to be like a real risk taker you know i mean that's a wild thing to suggest for the first time some guy in a board meeting like i got an idea we should be racing these  like what'd you say  uh town over said that the fastest ones say we settle it you know i'm not making fun of the olympians the concept is wild it's a while like if your best friend invented the special olympics and told you about it first you'd be like don't ever tell anybody that  were you going to tell that to what are you doing polvo  i actually personally i actually volunteered and coached with the special olympics for a little while so you know what you guys do no don't clap please i did it for those kids  i look like this so me coaching the special olympics i was like a  double agent no one knew whose side i was on dude player chaperone no one knew i'd be standing there coaching holding a clipboard with five dudes that looked exactly like me i always see the coaches from the other team looking over like i think they got i think they're  letting one of them coach yeah no i did coach this special olympics for a little while and it's fun that's another thing you're allowed to talk about it's happy everyone there's sportsmanship it's it is funny don't let anyone tell you it's not funny dude i was there  everyone there is laughing it's fun i coach basketball kids would catch the ball just  just  launch it into the bleachers people be like what the  you doing out there my whole team ruled everybody every dude on my team was they were the funniest they  they were bros they're bros dude my whole team loved two things they love tits they do i don't know if you know these guys dude they  love the ladies they love the ladies and they love john cena that's it that was the news

him  see it just here's like the angel of death for those guys i told my guys i was like you see seen it coming you get the  out of there he's taking souls with him  every year hooters would sponsor our one basketball tournament all right so every year hooters would bring like three or four waitresses and they would present like a big cardboard check donation to the special olympics as soon as the girls entered the gym the game changed entirely dude it went from like hugs and sportsmanship to just like dudes got competitive like very competitive  ripping down rebounds just hitting layups  and then at the end of the game there'd be a hug line you know between the waitresses and the players and yeah that went about exactly exactly how you would imagine that went we to break out the  jaws of life dude my boys my boys are ragged on those young  and i'm not knocking the the players they were totally in the right the girls were hot the waitresses like every year i would sneak into the hog line myself all right i think i'm going to get out of here guys thank you guys very much this is a lot of fun thank you   so      you
Dave Chappelle,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZXoErL2124,"-  I'm just
afraid of being attacked. It happens to the best of us. Don't ever forget what happened to that French actor. You know who I'm talking bout? Jussie Smollett. He's a very French, very
famous French actor. (audience laughs) Y'all never heard of Jussie Smollett? (audience laughs) Jussie Smollett is a actor from France. (audience laughs) And he became famous on
a show called Empire. One night, he was in Chicago late at night and was the victim, (laughs)
(audience laughs) he was the victim of a
racist and homophobic attack. You see, Jussie Smollett is (audience laughs) gay and he is black. Not just French. (audience laughs) Oh, it was a crazy story. Apparently, when he was walking down
the street late at night two white men came out of the shadows with MAGA hats on and beat him up. Tied a rope around his neck, called him all kinds of n**** and put some bleach on him
and ran off into the night. (audience laughs) The shit was like international news. And everybody was furious, especially in Hollywood. It was all over everybody's Twitter feed and Instagram page. ""Justice for Jussie!"" and all this shit. (audience laughs) The whole country was up in arms. Was talking about it all
the time on the news. And for some reason, African Americans, we
were like oddly quiet. (audience laughs) We was so quiet about the shit that the gay community started accusing African
American community of being homophobic
for not supporting him. What they didn't understand is that we were supporting him with our silence. (audience laughs) Because we understood that this n**** was clearly lying. (audience applauds) None of these details added up at all. He said he's walking down
the street in Chicago and white dudes come up to him and say, ""Hey man, aren't you that
f*** n*** from Empire?"" What the f***? Does that sound like
how white people talk? I know white people, they
don't talk like that. Are you that f*** n*** from Empire? They would never say that. It sounds like something that I would say. (audience laughs) If you're a racist and homophobic you're not even gonna
know who this n*** is. You can't watch Empire. (audience laughs) Black people never feel
sorry for the police but this time we even
felt sorry for the police. Can you imagine if you
was a police veteran taking this kids police report? ""Okay Mr. Smollett, please
tell me what happened? ""Alright, two a.m. You
left the house at two a.m., ""it was minus 16 degrees. (audience laughs)
""Alright. ""You were walking? You
were walking. Alright. (audience laughs) ""And where were you going? ""Subway?"" ""Sandwiches?"" (audience laughs) ""That's when the men approached you? ""Did you see them? Did you have any-- ""Okay, what did they have on? ""MAGA hats?! (audience laughs) ""MAGA hats on in Chicago? ""Excuse me one second Mr. Smollett ""Frank, come here for a second. (audience laughs) ""Find out where Kanye West was last night"" (audience laughs)"
Dave Chappelle,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-ONlhskCrA,thank you thank you very much thank you what's going on good to see everybody out here tonight hey have a seat everybody be comfortable and relax oh my gosh good to be back in austin texas it's good to know that plaid is back in most dudes i meet around these parts are dressed like a dyke in new york so i'm glad to see that  man  texas this place is it's pretty good pretty damn good you know i was in santa fe the other night  threw a banana peel at me yeah that didn't feel so good of course it was a white person uh not to indict the whites i'm just saying and then uh not only did he throw banana pill at me but uh it was premeditated you could tell you could tell the peel was too brown you know what i mean it was like you didn't eat that banana recently  you had that  waiting on me and the whole crowd was white so the whole it just got instantly creepy and everyone was looking like they were looking at 12 years of slave or something they were always like who the  does that and then they arrested the guy which was i said someone's gonna  you in the butt and the holding cell you know that right can't just be throwing banana peels at dave's belly they're not gonna let you get away with this when the press called me up like do you have a statement a statement for a  banana peel no i don't have anything to say this guy was like  famous for throwing a banana peel at me 20 years from now he's going to be tucking his kids in the bed and the kid will be like daddy tim about the day that she threw that banana peel with that  and santa effect boy i'll tell you what that black  saw his name upon the marquee about a week before i said man if i could just get close enough to meet him throw a banana on that  shanghai  banana gate i didn't even like i didn't even want to press charges you know this has happened to me before no sir not a banana i live i live in ohio right so this is like like a few winters ago oh i didn't know you would ever clap for that well all right that's the first time that she's ever happened oh anyway uh i live amongst the whites small town in ohio and it was winter time and it had snowed recently so a huge snowstrips on the street i was walking with my sister now my sister was dressed in all muslim garb as were her children and i was dressed as dave chappelle and we were walking and just talking about something and a car sped around the corner and the window came down and somebody threw a snowball and hit me right in my shoulder i didn't know what's going on why was this happening because i'm black because she's muslim because i'm dave chappelle i couldn't tell but again i knew it was premeditated because who the  has a snowball and a warm car straight through lady because he went around the corner and got stopped at the red light he was caught in the traffic so now i ran out into the street and i just tapped on his window hey my man can i just talk to you guys for a second come on now  one second i just want to talk to you there's four young white dudes in the car they're like just chill bro relax i just want to talk now this is an old black trick really i didn't want to talk i was going to  them up so if you're ever caught in traffic and the black guy starts saying he just want to talk to you don't open the door  even if he's me smiling at you and they were like chill bro just chill and and then the one guy in the back seat i don't know what he was just cockier than his friends he was like  it man i'll get out the car and i started yanking on this door let me help you  let me just help you out and i didn't notice his window was down and he threw a snowball that  me right in my chest wow he said  you you   and then the light turned green and they sped off and i smiled from ear to ear i looked at my sister and she said i got the plates and i was happy and  because throwing a snowball in a  is a misdemeanor assault but if you call me hey me my sister stop dancing we look in this  jail now i didn't notice it but while i was yelling him a crowd of all white people had formed because it was an all-white town and i was like uh-oh i thought it was going to get jumped and one of the white guys stepped in was like i didn't like that at all  this is not what this town represents i don't want this goddamn stuff in my vicinity and another white guy was like yeah i didn't like it either and then an old white guy stepped out of the crowd and said young man if you're going to fill out a police report i would like to come with you and do the same i said you guys would do that for me and hope i said hooray i said come on y'all i look like malcolm x going to see brother johnson with a trailer wifey  unreal hour later was always sitting in the police station and police came in like well mr chappelle 16 identical police reports we ran the tags two young men that had their mother's car we have all four suspects in holding their mother is here it's up to you whatever you want to do if you want to press charges we'll move forward sorry about that officer i'm a little flustered i've never been in a position where i could decide the fate of white children before but it's weighing heavy on me sir and i really can't decide and i saw a lady pacing back and forth in the hallway and i said is that because yes that's their mother well can i speak to her before i make a decision and when the mom came in she saw it was me she busted out crying oh god i don't know i don't want him to go to jail i am so sorry i didn't raise him to do this we love your comedy we love you at the house i said miss please just all right look i don't necessarily want your son to go to jail either but what he did was pretty was pretty  up so is there something we can do short of jail just to let him know that he's wrong i don't know i don't know what did you have in mind miss i've never been in this position before oh you know what we could do i don't know if i'm asking too much but maybe if you if you could just suck my dick a little bit just a little bit i'm not gonna finish i just want you to do it enough so that i can tell him you did it  i'm kidding i wouldn't do that to anybody's mother maybe my kid's mom but that's it ebola was in texas ebola made a visit  killed that man in dallas five days that man melted to death what happened to the brother in dallas where was the secret serum is what we all said i remember in the beginning of ebola there were two american doctors that got sick in africa they flew them in a private jet straight to atlanta to the cdc i didn't even know cdc saw patients there it was said they administered what the new york times called a secret serum i don't know what's in it it's just like colonel santa's recipe but both of these  survived these doctors thank god are healthy they are out there somewhere tonight at whole foods touching vegetables walking around everything's okay hey frank how are you oh you didn't hear i had a bullet last week but uh i'm doing all right now i was bleeding out of my eyes and anus so i got concerned but i'm okay what happened to the brother in dallas they just rub some vicks on that   i knew he wasn't gonna make it i already know sad i saw in the new york times they said ebola is the new aids isn't that something here i am thinking that old age was working just fine and they already have a new aids out isn't that amazing how they do that and it's weird how there's a disease that just starts in 1980 and it doesn't kill anybody but   and junkies isn't that a  amazing coincidence that this disease hates everybody that old white people hate i think either god is white or the government hid that  in disco balls only fun people get aids last month on the front of new york times the measles was a headline i had to check the date of the paper i was like measles what is this 1850 what the  is this why is measles in the news turns out they were trying to decide if mandatory vaccinations for children is the way we all want to go any thoughts i'm sorry ladies and gentlemen i just uh i don't know i don't know about this one first of all black people generally don't trust doctors you know after the tuskegee experiments and all that  more importantly don't forget michael jackson was killed by a doctor granted he was doing drugs but if i was a heroin addict and i had a licensed physician injecting heroin in me i should survive that i'll just be looking like i'm good right i'm good it's not too much is it dr butterfingers killed michael jackson after that that was like  going to the doctor  the  i get my kids vaccinated for old ass disease like measles this is you might as well give them a diarrhea shot if you're so worried diarrhea has a bigger body count than the measles do you know diarrhea is funny today but a hundred years ago if your ass had diarrhea you were a gunner there was like a zero chance of survival you get that first squirt uh-oh better start getting my affairs in order but i don't have much time it's diarrhea it's very serious i'm just watching buddies slowly die in a pool of his own  i give up diarrhea nowadays your buddy just back we got diary just eat a banana  drink some water let's get to the club still make last call tough time for the blacks these are not good times for the blacks i don't know if you know what i'm talking about right police are killing us again very unfortunate set of circumstances because we were doing very well you know america has a racial hot seat i think we can all agree that that's the truth and we can also agree that that hot seat is traditionally occupied by african americans in general african-american men in particular although i can see that in recent years that seat has been occupied by by mexicans and i dare say arabs and we the black americans would like to thank you both for your sacrifice and your struggle we needed a break we needed a goddamn break we all go through something but at least i can leave my backpack someplace if you are up and forget your backpack you got about 20 minutes before they send that robot to blow your  up afro hot now isis is number one on the terrorist charts and isis is  scary because if isis catches you they're going to cut your head off that's what they do i've seen them do it on youtube it was  awful he looked right in the camera obama i am back  i saw that  i said oh my god don't like  how's this guy cutting people's heads off on youtube i can't even post a dick pic and this  is decapitating people i'm gonna have to change my settings you know everyone has it hard but i think harder than black people and harder than arabs and harder mexicans you know who hasn't the worst fat black people it's hard for white people to understand but that's what i'm saying is very true fat black people have a really rough road because all manner of things kill white people but you know what kills more black people than anything more than police and terrorism salt  regular here white people are getting ebola cures and  and meanwhile i'm dying from  the flavor  look honestly let me i'll stop talking about it let me say this stuff let me just say this can we all can we all just say that we've seen it coming were you surprised it's like when that guy threw that banana at me do you think i was surprised hell no i've been in show business 30 years i was expecting this banana i knew one of these nights is like somebody gonna throw a banana at me one of these nice   because that's how it starts with the name calling like that paula dean remember paula dean got fired from the food network if you know anything about show business it is really hard to get fired from the  food network and they dropped that  like a hot potato all because she called somebody an n-word 30 years before she had a show i don't know who she said it to but whoever was just looking at her like i'mma get you for this  and she came back 30 years later like a bill cosby rape and sucker battleship and every black person was mad but we weren't like that man i was just like well how's this  gonna call me a  when she told me how to fried chicken that's not fair  i think donald sterling  was more serious remember donald sterling he used to own the clippers and then he got caught on a secretly recorded tape saying some very unsavory things about african americans and there's a lesson in that for all of us the lesson is if you are old and white and racist in this great country whatever you do don't tell your black girlfriend about that  because that's who made the tape she recorded all that  and the tape was terrible he was like stop bringing these black guys to my games first we're all confused like well how the  you gonna have a game without us  but it turned out that the black guy he was speaking of was none other than magic johnson the billionaire unbelievable never even mention the fact that he had aids which is this guy must be really racist if age is the footnote yeah be careful baby he got the old ebola   you can say what you want about that girl but i'm gonna tell you right now she is a god damned hero because you might have thought these things were happening before but now you can see it all in front of you without a shadow of a doubt that  actually went down she sucked that old guy's dick she really took one for the team on that one that's really gross this dick is like 80 years old it's like tasting history like five wars on it civil rights movement great depression  this guy has been  from 40 years before bill cosby's first rape this is a very old man a very old penis  but all that  is still it's just name-calling it like name calling does not break the modern black man that's not gonna do the trick i don't give a  about that like if i went to kentucky fried chicken ku klux klan hood on top of their head what do you think i'm gonna do in this day and age right now i can take a fried chicken not if i'm hungry i'll go straight to the front hey man let me get a two-piece i don't give a  what he says you want a biscuit with that  i thought it came with a biscuit what's all this attitude i want a two-piece chop chop you know what it is but i'm not gonna be mad why would i be mad he's the one that's gotta work at kentucky fried chicken not me  how about this what if i what if i lived in austin and i had a white girlfriend it's possible in austin as a matter of fact some people say it's necessary but that's not the point i mean my white girlfriend at home one night and we're just doing what lovers do maybe she's butt naked and she's down on one knee give me a hand job i love a good hand job and she's really jerking me off you know getting her obliques nice and tight i got a huge dick so she's like hmm and i'm like wow this really feels wonderful i i think i'm gonna come  i know that's a tough one but what do you think i'm gonna do hey  that's no time for integrity ladies and gentlemen i'm busting that nut in her face i'll soar through the ethics later but i'm what they call the man of his word if i say i'm coming oh i'm coming i'm gonna  what happens god forbid somebody can shoot me if i say i'm coming still doesn't mean i like getting shot  boy yeah tough time for the blacks i'm not gonna say nothing about the police i'll leave that for chris rock the other big sports story was  ray rice's tape anyone see that ray rice tape i can't stop watching it it's  awful that's the most violent thing i've seen happen to a woman that was shot in color really  bad like if i could have froze time at that moment and gave ray wright some advice i don't think there's any way possible i'd be like you should punch her in the face it's a  terrible idea in the same time i also believe she shouldn't have rushed him what the  was he like you can't beat him miss don't rush a  that's trained to stiff on people in the clutch he's going to get the upper hand only reason i bring him up is because you know he's about to play football again you didn't know that the nfl was told by a federal judge they had to reinstate ray rice because he was transparent with the investigation he told them exactly what he did and they can't just change your written that's like if i'm hanging out with my buddies and i'm like hey guys guess what i did last night i  this big fat girl i met at the club and they all like oh  dave that's crazy and then they see a tape of me doing it and they're like  we can't hang out with you anymore dave that's not what this crew is all about i'd be like what i told y'all what i did what's really  up was tape was made before they were married isn't that weird i don't know why she'd do that i don't even know why he would do that as a guy would you want to live with the woman that you had once punched in the face with all your strength and some very bold color purple type  silly come out here and shave me  you know your  mind i had to ask an older friend of mine just to get some perspectives older black dude actually the fairest person i've ever met and i asked him i just i just said hey man i said did you see that ray rice video and instantly he was like david that  was disgusting i wonder what she said to him i don't think that matters i think the idea is you're not supposed to punch her in the face my wife says terrible  to me my wife once called me a  in front of dinner guests  i know i started to get mad but then i was like  probably right  i am a  i admit it i'm soft and warm and persuasive like a real  right and then i told i said and if you don't take care of me properly i might stink like your  oh we fight dirty the chappelle household it's not a big deal  no no no no if you want to get to the bottom of a matter of the heart what you're supposed to do is ask a woman now actually there's two women that i know that both college professors in this little area i live in and i meet them twice a week at starbucks for coffee talk about important  and i asked the girls who's ray rice after he punched her in the face with all the strength and one of my girlfriends said david you need to wake the  up she's staying for the money well now wait a minute because my other girlfriend was like i disagree i think that she actually loves him and i said wait a minute ladies you know what i think that you're both right and what i was doing when i said that was preserving the possibility of a threesome with these   i've been chipping away this  one cup of coffee at a time for like four years i was gonna throw all that hard work away over some ray rice  i don't care that much  i'm just being real it's  up man it's tough time for the blacks i love you too and then here comes the banana peel i'm waiting on it any second you know that's how it starts i saw in the paper today i saw on the paper today that the guy that threw the banana at me got arrested again because he threw a banana at another  a bar insane effect look it up online after the show he actually did that and that guy was black too what a guy said he did it at night he said i did it because dave chappelle is racist so that's not the best way to handle that if i am racist what if martin luther king just went around throwing tuna casserole on white people would that would that work huh i seen your girl bubbling she's drunk as hell buddy listen sir i don't know what she's saying but just take my advice get some water in her or you're gonna have some dry  when you get home this dick's gonna be shaped the  up tomorrow santa maria who got a cigarette in here anyone got cigarette ball uh yeah you you fella oh yeah please  well let me see this this is a marlboro menthol this could have been anybody it was a newport i'd be like a black dude through that but marlboro menthol that's one of the riddles  is the word  offensive all right just checking just checking i asked that crowd when he's in denver i said is the worst people one was a woman in the front older than me maybe around my age uh definitely a feminist you know what i mean short haircut plant shirt you know what i'm saying and she didn't say it offended her what she said and she said i'm uncomfortable with that word and i was like really you uh and then before i could ask you why there was one other guy he was in the balcony now i don't think he was saying this to me but he said this everybody heard him said he goes it's delicious  i don't think i've ever heard  called delicious before in my life now this is not to say that's bad but it's definitely an acquired taste i don't think any of us taste  our first time like hey it's good it needs something you know it's illegal for a gynecologist to say the word  they can only say vagina or they can name individual parts medically but they can never say shorthand even if the gynecologist is a woman i feel like it was a woman  i don't think men should be allowed to be gynecologists that  is a conflict of interest even when my wife was pregnant we used to go to a gynecologist and he put her legs up in that stirrup like this he'd be like all right miss chappelle just try to relax i push his back up  i got this just tell me what to look for  one of those home style checkups there's too many ethical questions when men do that like can a gynecologist lose their license for smelling their fingers during an exam is that is that illegal how could they not these are men it's like if you have a good barbecue you don't even think about it you just the word  is only offensive if you're older people my age and younger i don't think we even we danced to that  that song come on the radio said i beat the  up that's our song it's like nothing like a love song there's no tracks of his tears no midnight trains to georgia this man simply beats the  up unbelievable  you don't even know if he's having sex with these women they might just pull their pants down he'd be like g-unit like you'll be watching hbo hi i'm larry merchant standing here ringside with the  after a devastating bout with 50 cent  come over here and let me talk to you for a second my god you look terrible your lips seem to be swollen you're bleeding a little bit tell me plus it was what happened inside of that ring with 50. i don't know there i felt really good in the first round i was ready to fight it's warm and moist and um i don't know if you just hit me from angles i wasn't expecting the front left back side surprised me the most  well  let's take a look at round four this is where it all went wrong for you here you come out of your corner  you fight really good it looks like you got 50 with a right and left but then 50 slips your jab in there there right there you see that he punches you right on that um that little bean thing you have on the top of your head i don't know what that is but there's 50 just pounding away at that bean over and over and that pudding gets rattled around like that i don't think i was thinking anything larry you know i'm a real good defensive fighter it's real hard to get to me uh i've never been punched directly on my beam before as a matter of fact most fighters don't even know that bean exists i guess he just hit me then i lost control of my legs i don't know what else to tell you   i like when lil wayne talks about  because he is little white man little wayne that song he say i got a bishop plays movies in my jacuzzi and it goes like this but is it juicy that  that  always makes me laugh because there's no guy says that you know only a little wayne will say some  like that if he was  a gun she's like is this  good  it's juicy it's good  juice that's why i'm not lil wayne because if i was in a hot tub with a girl and i could tell that the  was juicy while i was in the hot tub i'd probably get out of the tub i'm a germaphobe i just pushed a little wayne like what is this strange oil floating in my hot tub water juice actually was so funny to me i must have wrote like no less than 40 jokes with the punchline  juice and all of them work to some degree 100 of the time i'll do one more just so you believe me okay all right in this next piece it's a special episode of csi for some reason lil wayne's guest starring as the lead detective okay that's the setup are you ready here it goes has anyone else been on this crime scene no it's very strange this place is virtually undisturbed no forced entry no sign of a struggle shining a flashlight right here just stepped on something what is this what is this it glistens in the light smooth to the touch  39 more that came from everybody's mad about something recently i got attacked online by some gay bloggers and it hurt my feelings i have no problem with gay people but i  hate bloggers i'm not saying it because this person was gay they was acting like a  online it was like mischaracterizing my jokes trying to make a point off of me when it was really it's like yo i'm your ally  i'm not trying to stop gay people i got better  to do this  was saying things to try to get gay people to beat me up seriously he was like dave chappelle's jokes i don't know how he actually talks to making his voice up david chappelle's jokes were an affront to the manhood of all gay men what the  does that mean i didn't say anything that would allude to gay men not being men i know you meant in fact what could be manlier than  another guy in the ass it's the most gangster  i've ever heard of in my life i told you i'm not cut out for that i'm a  you know what i said that's all i said first of all i'll tell you right now what i said uh and i will tell you that this was not a joke it's a true story and i just happened to tell it all right what happened was i went to a gallery party all right i don't know who in here has ever been rich before but these are very nice parties uh you know wine and cheese and ball of conversation and there was a few eccentric types one of which was a very wealthy man that happened to be wearing a dress i don't know what you call me this is a  or drag queen perhaps whatever it was is definitely a man and this man was definitely on drugs i don't know what kind of drugs he's on but i knew he had too much he didn't look good it's like this he's like he looks sick and all his friends were standing around him concerned trying to revive him i don't know whether he looked like some kind of gay cpr those fanning and  i saw all this from a distance now i should have minded my own business but i got curious i was like and i went over there all i said i said excuse me gentlemen gentlemen is he okay and then they looked at me like i was evil she is fine i'm sorry to know this is what we were doing um here's my thing i support anybody's right to be whoever they feel like they are inside i mean ally in that however my question is to what degree do i have to participate in your self-image is it fair that i have to change my whole pronoun game up for this  that didn't make sense seriously if i put on an argyle sweater and i'm like hey everybody i feel like a white guy in the sweater and i want some goddamn respect in a bank loan it's not gonna work give a  out i feel why should i go  how you feel  is a pronoun but there was no time for philosophical debate this was an emergency situation i said fine sorry guys i was just worried because because she looks terrible she just fell off the bench appears that her dick is popping out of her dress no matter if i call an ambulance champ i'd rather not be at a party where  od there's too many questions to answer  okay i've been through this before i had a friend from high school now in high school this guy was a thug wheel right he was a  dope boy he did it all he's a wild dude people used to be very scared of him and then after high school word on the street was he'd come out the closet i personally didn't believe it i bring him up because last year he calls me out of the blue like yo what's up man i got your number from so-and-so and i heard you gonna be in new york doing a show could i get some tickets i was like  yeah get some tickets man how you been he said well we'll catch up at the show man but yo i'm appreciate i see you soon i said all right man take care and i was about to hang up and i couldn't resist i was just like hey  i heard she was gay what's going on with that and i wish i didn't ask because he sounded like he was dying to talk about that  and he had a long story about it and it's not that i didn't care but i was you know i don't like talking on the phone i was watching tv at the same time so i just wasn't really paying attention like i should but i was trying to sound supportive i didn't really know what to say so i just like mumbling  throughout this conversation i just like oh you know you gay man you just gay this went on for a while and then finally i had to say something like definitive to get him off the phone and i was like hey man you know what don't let people get you down all right and uh the next time someone tries to make you feel bad about yourself just remember everybody  funny to somebody he didn't like that  he's like what the  does that mean i said huh you see you saying i  funny  i said no that's not what i'm saying i'm saying everybody's different he said you ain't say different  you said you said funny it was so  funny about the way i  and i said hey man i  feet he said what oh this is not a joke ladies and gentlemen i get women to squeeze their feet together like this and i  them right in that little space in their feet but you can't build a community behind that  there's no flag for us that  made him laugh the next day after the show i saw him backstage he was like yo what's up man i'm like oh  what's going on and he had his buddy with him he goes dave wishing me man well man where's my fiance we're in new york getting married because it's legal here i said oh oh well uh that's yes and he went to go get some drinks and then my buddy looked at me he was like so dave what do you think and i started mumbling again hey  you know just gay girl see i'm a little nervous about getting married man it's a big step so yeah it is big step he said well you've been married for a while you got any advice for us no i'm married to a woman sorry about that and then corrected me he said no you married the person that you love so it's essentially the same i said you know man uh the problem with that statement is that it makes the assumption that i love but you guys lighting the  up of course i love my wife she laughs at this  as a matter of fact she eats and spins this  you know what i told him i told i told him i said you know what you should do man first of all you should you shouldn't do it uh i'm talking about being legally married it's not that you're gay as much as just legal marriage is a  diabolical leverage game in the united states i'm just being honest devoid of religious significance or the idea of love marriage is nothing but an awful contract that you shouldn't sign just being real because you start out loving each other and then like two years later you're just building a case against one another for a hypothetical court date that may or may not ever happen you know being gay on top of that that  is explosive like i said ray right  okay right after ray rice went through all that  i was at a party and i met this kid michael sands you know michael sams very nice guy he's the first openly gay nfl player and mike was a very nice guy very brave guy but when i met him i couldn't help but thinking his wife up in the elevator is that domestic violence or is that just two  working  out in the elevator you know what i mean  anyway i give all married men the same advice gay or straight get a dog this dog will love you all the time but she's not going to it was real talk i didn't even i didn't even know about dogs and my kids got the dog they brought them home from the shelter and i didn't even want it they were like can we keep them i said nope i said where'd you even get this dog we got him from the shelter i was like uh probably something wrong with them can't keep them and then my kids started crying and screaming like the dog had gambling debts please dad if you don't let us keep them they're gonna kill them all right you can keep him and his dog was a menace i hated his guts then one night i smoked a bunch of weed and i was eating a sandwich and staring at me this will make you very uncomfortable if you're just looking at you i had to give him a piece of my sandwich so he'd go away and that's how we became friends now if you see me walking down the street with baba i ain't got no leash or nothing he walks right next to me if i if i stop he'll stop and if i go he'll go and all my friends like yo dave that  is dope how you training baba to do that  hmm i've never trained baba just a messy eater if i drop food and baba's not around all i gotta do is call him baba he's a black dude's dog so they didn't come right away he peeks first to see what's going on i gotta tap my foot so we can see the food over here little buddy and he's like thanks david he'll come get it and run off but he knows all my habits like if he smells weed in the house he'll be like this motherfucker's about to eat and i'll just come running  bob i got me through a very difficult time in my marriage we spend the most time together like it's not that me and my wife don't spend time together but we've been married so long it's like we don't we don't talk like i don't know anyone's married here but if after 10 years all that chatty  goes away you've said it all you know what i mean yeah we're just in the zone she says the same  to me every night before she goes to bed i'll be the last one up she's like let me get some sleep dave good night all right baby we'll stay and watch television good night and she'll walk halfway up the steps david huh don't eat the kid's lunch and then she walks away  well the crazy  is i don't even eat their lunch anymore in the day i used to eat that  you know how that goes i might smoke some weed in the middle of the night and she'll leave neatly wrapped sandwiches all over the kitchen i'm going to eat it what's the big deal why can't you just make another one in the morning i mean it's like i got sons anyway my sons live everything that dads do my kids would be in school the next day just look like oh dad bit my sandwich oh  you could trade that sandwich for something better what i'm doing is adding value to their lunch she doesn't understand these types of things anyway she gets mad at me she's mad at me now because i got myself in trouble i got myself extorted which happens in this business i come home from the road there was a fedex sitting on the kitchen table and it was addressed to me so i opened it i don't know who delivered it and there was a video cassette inside with a note written on it that said gotcha oh my god can you imagine i freaked out i tore the whole house apart trying to find the vcr i hadn't seen the tape in like over a decade and i watched the tape and it was awful they got me it was a tape of me i was  a girl okay but it was from before i was married but it's not a good look and i felt sick to my stomach and i looked up at the clock and then i saw my wife was coming home in 10 minutes and i just panicked i i jerked off to the tape real fast and then  and then i called the fbi much better i mean they didn't say they were going to catch them for sure but they had the demeanor of some competent people that would catch them so i didn't worry about it too much and then not even a week later five days later i come home and there's another video cassette just sitting on my porch as soon as i saw it i just called the police like they've done it again uh you should probably look for a guy with bell bottoms on because i don't know who the  is sending tapes and that second tape was the worst  i'd ever seen in my life it was awful career ending bad it was a tape of me jerking off to the table week earlier i don't even know how how even get such a thing i had to explain all of this to my wife she was very mad no thing in this world is as cold as a woman's cold shoulder because she was mad but she wouldn't talk to me about it she would just punish me in little ways make me do  that i hate to do like pick the kids up from school that's one thing that's a hardship for me i got one son that goes to a public school and her brother goes to a private school it's an experiment i just want to see what's going to happen to him but what's weird is my little son in private school he's like my he's like my thuggy son you know what i mean i don't know where he'd get that from he's not getting it from me and he's definitely not getting from that school this school is very like it's a liberal school it's the kind of school there might be like 12 black students in the entire school and i'm the only black parent  and none of the parents like me either not because i'm black but just like they don't like hyrule because i've been showing up late all the time and i'm like in a porsche and a blast in music that they don't like music i beat the  up and i pull into the parking lot i might be smoking a cigarette with the kids in the car then i pull in like that handicap space and then when i get out of the handicapped space they always want to say some passive aggressive  morning dave uh i don't know if you noticed but he actually parked in the handicapped space huh yeah you know you know what frank i did notice uh but who's this handicapped guy we're all waiting on that never shows up  so i hate going over to that school the only only parents that are nice to me is a lesbian couple kate and sarah actually kate hates my guts sarah knows that i'm black and she's half black so she just understands me you know what i'm saying i can't explain it because i'll say  and kate's just too serious about being a lesbian i'd be like hey kate hey sarah uh you guys going to the father-son picnic next week how's that going to work and kate will instantly be furious but sarah knows i'm  around so she'll just say something cool i don't know dave maybe me and kate will flip for that  i said  you better save that coin toss because everybody knows you strapping onto that household and then kayla turned bright red but sarah just fist bumped me like you right  it's me we're good friends we're good friends they invite me to stuff they're like my only friends at school so imagine my surprise when i go to pick my son up after all this happens and uh the teacher is waiting outside for me she's just standing right there in the middle of the  handicap space i knew something was wrong so i wrote the one we talked to you for a minute in the office i said no  that we gotta talk right here what's going on and it was bad ibrahim had a fight i said a fight don't worry everyone's okay i said everyone what happened well that's it we don't know what happened because he won't talk to anybody all we know is that he punched sarah jr in the face i said oh no sarah's one of the only parents i'm not sure i can beat up in this school just then kate and sarah pulled up to pick up their daughter and then we all had to go into the office and i was really worried i didn't want them to kick me out of the school and then they brought my son and he was crying they brought him in like a prisoner he was like oh oh i said son just stop crying calm down do not look at these mean faces i need you to look at my face and i need you to tell me the truth buddy all right just tell me the truth is it true did you punch that girl sarah junior in the face i was trying to give him a signal to lie but he didn't pick up on it i was like  he wasn't paying attention i punched your face oh my god why why would you do that you're not supposed to put your hand so gangsta it scared all the parents in the room he was like oh because she had it coming  and everyone looked at me i said i did not teach you i don't know where he got that from i said what does that mean that is crazy talk what does that mean and then he just started crying like he was tupac these kids keep  with me  i told his teacher i said well well now wait a minute this is a lot of things but he's not a liar and if he said they was  with him they did something to him son what's going on what did they do to you oh damn tired of this  it's been going on all week i said what's going on all week he said he said hutch and that  bit my sandwich i said this is the fourth time this week i'm tired of sandwich biting  stop using that word let's go home that's a quiet car ride home we got the house he just ran right up to his room slammed the door his mother came downstairs by then she had heard about everything she was looking at me like oh my god she said you bit that goddamn sandwich  i said i'm tired of you accusing me of  and i just ran out of the house jumped in my car and drove off of course i bit that sandwich but i know that she was just really mad about that tape so now she's going to punish me about a   sandwich out bit that was man that's  you know what i said to myself i said i should just never go home  this  you know by the way that's how people used to get divorced in the 40s when a divorce court in america back in those days if you want to get out your marriage you should tell your wife hey baby i'm going to get a pack of cigarettes i'll be right back we will just leave with the clothes on your back that's when men were men and there was no internet back then so you could move 11 miles away and have a whole new life  but i ended up going back home late at night and came in the room and she was actually changing for bed you can always tell your wife is mad at you when they cover their titties up when you're walking oh let those titties out it's me baby can we just talk about this for a minute she said david there's nothing to talk about i already know you bit the sandwich and don't go looking for the lunch i hit it i said i want to talk about this sandwich baby i want to talk about it the tape i know that's why you're mad it was very difficult conversation i had to crack a few and we started talking and then she cracked a few jokes that hurt my feelings honestly but when we talk you know what she told me she told me that she was madder about the second extortion tape that she was about the first one which doesn't make sense at all what's wrong with a guy touching his own private parts it's my own business it's not like i do it all the time as a matter of fact sometimes i do it for her benefit a lot of guys do this it's called the mercy jerk that's the one that happens in the middle of the night when you're about to roll on top of it and you see her face and you're like she looks tired that takes a lot of love and discipline to back out of a room with a rock hard dick  sometimes i don't make it uh-oh someone fell asleep with the socks off didn't they you can't rape feet you can't rape feet  all the time i jerk off nails in the game sometimes she'll tell me dave i'm gonna take the kid to my mom real quick uh probably back in a couple of hours a couple hours  you can get a good one in in two hours that's the kind of session where you'll take all your clothes off i'll be butt naked in the living room like get these  toys out of my way disgusting foot all on the coffee table just stroking it out taking my time and i got a bowl of cereal waiting for me right here  that's when you have the privacy you can have a loud orgasm i miss those ah you know when a guy busts a net like right after that there's a window of like six minutes where he does the most rational thing he ever does that's when he's always horrified oh god what have i done oh my god it's everywhere thank you very much awesome texas i had a wonderful time be well be happy good night
Shane Gillis,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbkBRT13Zp4,has enough time pass that we can can we admit that Trump was funny and we finally admit that he was funny well hold on I don't I don't like the tone of that that's not what I'm going for here that's a great quality the commander-in-chief that's definitely Up For Debate but he was funny I saw it and I lived in New York so the whole time he was in office I would be like you know something would happen I'd show my friends look at that they'd be like what it's funny there's nothing funny about Donald Trump I don't know during Hurricane Dorian he was like maybe we should nuke it hey that was that was a real suggestion from the president the president said that the president United States he was like hey we got a big storm coming you guys want me to blow it up I was like no what the  are you talking about I don't know I  around dude that's what I do foreign I'll never like I'll never watch a debate ever again you imagine like just a regular debate now after we went like we witnessed the goat undefeated it debates and he never said a fact you know how impressive that is he was funny and he argued like a fifth grader he was Unstoppable people try to hit him with Statistics and facts he would just go wrong holy  dude how was no one prepared for this  go back and watch those debates forget how how good how electric that  was don't tell your friends in Austin they'll be mad just get a six-pack toss on a trump highlight video on YouTube good night dude why I went back I watched his first debate that's like my favorite one at the time Trump was pulling it like less than one percent like he was no one liked him if you guys like him now you didn't back then and I know that because my dad I watched my dad my dad at the time he would like anytime Trump even came on TV my dad would look at this  Joker get him off the  screen and then now my dad's like  guys can't go to the Capitol he's like guys can't have fun anymore he's like and it was because of the debates that's what did it dude that's how we got Trump these debates and the first one is the best one so it's a Republican primary everyone's up on stage and they're all still doing their political  so like the first couple guys that talk are like I'm from Kentucky and I love education and the crowd's like nice we didn't know what was coming and the next guy's like I'm from Georgia and I love religion the crowd's like pretty good this is a good one this is a heated debate and then I finally got to Trump's turn to talk and he was just like Rand Paul is ugly and the whole crowd was like oh you know you could do that in this you can just do that as your thing and Rand Paul it's like all right everybody settle down we're trying to have a debate here and the whole crowd was like shut the  up Rand Paul ugly  and we just kept throwing dorks up on stage to make them debate Trump it was not fair it was mean for us to have done that to people these guys were in politics their whole lives they just had to debate a  Maniac up there who didn't give a  dude and I hate it was fun to cheer for him in the debates it was fun to cheer for him in the debates because he dude he was going up against guys that had been in politics for like 40 years and then he showed up to the event like oh  what are we talking about he had no clue every week he had no  idea there's one debate there's one debate he's like in the middle of it going back and forth about the economy with Ted Cruz they're literally talking about the economy in the middle of it he's just like Ted's wife ugly as a dog holy  dude Ted was like I'm from Texas you don't talk about a man's family like that you've got a dog wife Ted everyone knows   hahaha yeah and a week later Ted Cruz was on TV like I support Donald J because like you  I will say this the one thing that talked about Trump losing was for me was because I just figured out kind of how to do his voice because that's kind of a bummer that I just it's not hard to do Trump it's very all you have to do that just do that do that a second off from where it should be in the sentence and then all you like you don't have to sound like

strength so no fighting a man has ever  cool every this is this is what that means I've never lost a fight but I've also never not cried in a fight every point is just me getting punched in the face first and then I cry and I have one move I just cry and walk straight at the person they squeeze it as hard as I which sucks cuz when you win a fight you want to be like yeah dude I got one fights at parties have been like in your head you're like if you would have quite a party maybe you'll get some  people think you're cool but no no chick wants to  that guy no chicks like oh man you see then

hundred benching 350 dude I was  you so imagine that Frankenstein movie we were watching my friends play and we played on the football team so we would fight like the Townies it was Division one so all my friends were just jacked black dudes it was pretty  second I would just beat the  out these people is like Burlington North Carolina they were all white trash and I would stand next to this dude watch my friend fight and I definitely was just scratching my ass or something I was just reaching behind me and this guy thought I was reaching for a gun just right next to me just socked me in the  mouth this is the coolest thing I've done I chucked my beer it slammed it when I grabbed it I remember he felt perfectly like he felt I felt sitting facing that way he felt sitting right here and I just grabbed him by his hair and then the last fight I got it was in at Penn State and this guy I was at a party I was at a college party when I was out of college which is  sick with my friends and my one friend who's a  talker was like he just was like this kids talking  on you dude he's trying to fight you and I was like now he's not like he's definitely wasn't he was just sitting there and he was like the neck guy just stood up and was like what the  if I am dude and so I was like well then we'll fight definitely and he was so little that's another thing I've never fought anyone my size

walked out and grabbed him and held him and there was like a waste time wall in this person's backyard and I was just holding him over it and from his back he  punched me in the face one handed punch I broke his nose there's blood everywhere it's  sick  sick then I blacked out I got drunk and I woke up in bed next to this girl blood on my hands that's the  guy was like you want to hook up and she's like ooh gross but yeah none of my fights are cool my dad has cool fights my dad you're  him but I grew up in a creek on the creek in it the kind of the gwinin mechanics period Pennsylvania like

like a normal guy but I mean he's still a  psycho like he went to Notre Dame he left no Dame he went to the Marines in Vietnam and then left and came back and became a prison warden is because he worked as he's been in prisons his whole life so like he talks like a black guy from the seventies  my cousin Jeff caught him bench-pressing in the garage listening to ghetto boys so he would eat at the time he was a volunteer firefighter and stealing stealing in Pennsylvania and he would he would he would be like a first responder so he had a what's that called a scanner and he would take calls anyone get to the fire first so I got a call once and he raced over there to get it these people said there was a house fire and he got there and it was just a just for  idiots it was a motorcycle that had caught fire that they just put out with a garden sentence shout out  hackers for you Nicole do you want the beer the Nazis drink it says since 1417 berry this beers been through a ton so I

my sweatpants money on doritos what the does that mean what could it possibly mean is the money in sweatpants is it for sweatpants if it's forced wet pants why does your clothing cost as much as snacks that's my community baby yeah that's uh it's a funny neighborhood you know uh it's a bunch of those guys and then a bunch of like uh recent immigrants from south and central america and then a bunch of greek people that are mad that immigrants are stealing their neighborhood it's a bunch of old greek guys that are like uh you know they don't even they don't even speak english exactly okay okay man you don't speak english what what's the issue yeah it was a fun little immigrant upbringing over there any immigrants here yeah nice where you from mexico nice classic does that count here like this is mexico right like it should be mexico but do you like your parents yeah both of them both you don't like one more than the other the mom more than that when's the last time you and your dad hugged  we got him uh it's all good dude for me me and my dad it was the last time greece got to the quarterfinals of the world cup that was yeah yeah i don't know if you guys know this uh i don't know if this is your experience but immigrants one of their favorite parenting techniques is uh child abuse i don't know if you guys knew that like my dad didn't hit us that much but his go-to move was this was just like oh do your homework oh and to this day he'll be like well come on i never hit you and it's like yeah but you always could have you know never really felt off the table pops i had a lot of friends from similar backgrounds you know i think you kind of attract that and uh you know one of my buddies we we became really close later in life and he's still one of my best friends today but we were first friends she was like opening up to me you know he was confiding in me and he was like yeah dude my dad used to just get up off wine coolers and beat the out of me and i i knew it shouldn't have tripped me up but i was like i'm sorry dog you said wine coolers okay yeah i just knew when i came home and i saw that daiquiri mix in the freezer i was in for a long night of being whipped with maraschino cherry stems i didn't get a lot of lessons from my dad i'll be honest i didn't you know he didn't teach me a lot of stuff i didn't get a sex talk even you know the close i got to a sex talk was one time we were in greece and uh he was watching pornography just in the living room not not in his chambers right and it's a james bond theme porno and when james bond starts getting sucked off my dad looks at me he's like man and that was that was my sex talk just watching a british man get head with my father yeah i'll give him some credit though he was a really good dad when i was a little kid you know and then i think when i was like 10 or 11 he had a heart attack and he had one of those like near-death experience moments of clarity he was like oh my god what have i been doing with my time on earth i have to start cheating on my wife i can't i can't be a present father i have to buy a leather jacket from costco and get  yeah he cheated on my mom and i don't know how right like if if you're some sexy rich guy i get it i don't condone it but i see what happened what happened with my dad did some woman look at him and go oh my god when i saw that hunched over greek contractor take a piece of loose salami out of his pocket and eat it while laughing at a man in a wheelchair i knew i had to have him the way his shoulder hair waved in the wind yeah i don't know i've been going therapy though you know any therapy heads in the building nice what's your biggest trauma i'm kidding just a little light crowd work no i've been going to therapy a bunch and i have empathy for my dumb ass dad you know that sucks you know seeing it from his side you know cause look was he the best dad in the world no but did he do his best also no but you know whatever he gave it a hot 65 he did i'll give him credit again he gave me a better childhood than he had right that's really all you can ask on some level like his family was all  up like here's how my dad's parents met right this is greece in the 40s right it's still arranged marriages and no one in my grandfather's village wants to marry him right nobody doesn't matter how many goats they throw in the trade no one's biting right no one in mainland greece will marry him which is actually kind of impressive right like there's no internet this is word of mouth spreading about what a piece of  he is right basically what they end up doing is they catfish a family on an island eight hours away right there's no way for them to meet before the wedding they do the deal through letters uh finally it's set everything's good to go they take this eight-hour boat ride out to this woman's island and the second my grandfather steps off the boat the woman he's supposed to marry looks at him and goes no absolutely not i'm not i'm not marrying this guy and then her dad goes ah geez well he came all this way why don't you marry my other daughter and those are my grandparents that's them wild right have you ever had like a bad craigslist roommate and you're like once this lease is up i am out of here uh imagine if that lease was your whole life and that roommate creampied you because that that was my grandma's life and  yeah you'd think something like that would make somebody a and you would be correct in this instance actually  i feel bad and everything but really a tough hang i'll be honest with you guys i went to visit her actually on her deathbed and she had pretty bad dementia by the time i got to see her and i'm trying to communicate with her and she just looks at me and she goes who are you you got fatter it's like okay pick one okay either you don't know who i am or you don't know i got fatter that's how that works but i gotta hand it to her you know she snuck one in right at the buzzer three two one you're fat one of the best ever do it folks hanger moo moo up in the rafters i like my family they are pretty funny uh my mom's mom is funny too my grandma on the other side she's she's great she's very accepting but very ignorant at the same time which is a really funny combo like over the holidays a couple years ago we watched this old greek movie and one of the characters it's revealed thinks jews drink blood you know and it's like an old movie he's the village idiot it's obviously a joke everyone's making fun of him everybody's laughing i look at my family they're laughing i look at my grandma she's like confused i'm like oh grandma is this hilarious this guy thinks jews drink blood and she's like well yeah but they do right but the way she said it was and you shouldn't judge other people's culture stavros like what you think jews are vampires but we should let it slide for diversity reasons incredible perspective yeah yeah she's great uh but i will say the more time i spend around greek people the more time i think it's crazy the kinds of immigrants we're banning in this country you know like it should be us right like we got enough europeans right like a racist might be like oh well we can't have refugees from the middle east what if they commit sex crimes it's like okay well have you ever met an italian man you ever tried to purchase pizza in this country one time  hey bella how old you are that guy's getting waved through customs why  oh you know how inuit people have like 30 words for snow in their language italian is similar in that they don't have a single word for consent in theirs  no i shouldn't on italians i'm greek we're basically italians that peaked in high school right we've been coasting on democracy for quite some time now it is a gorgeous place though i do love visiting over there rocks i remember i took a i took a visit uh there a couple years ago uh with my girlfriend at the time and when you take an international trip like that with somebody you learned a lot about each other we're going for 10 days just me and her and what we learned is that we did not want to be together anymore that was that was the big takeaway for us kind of tough i'll be honest with you to break up on vacation you know that's not how you see your chase sapphire rewards going you know  you're paid three thousand dollars to be the saddest you've ever been it was my fault though i took a rich girl on vacation right rich people don't give a about vacations poor people could you imagine breaking up on vacation the only good week of your life you're not you're not doing that but don't get me wrong she wasn't like evil rich right she's not space for fun rich but i'll put it this way when the shampoo ran out in her home they just threw the bottle away right there was there was no filling it with water and living off bubbles for a week you know she never had shitty bubbles here right there were no omelets for dinner you know like whoa hot dogs again mom's the coolest it's like no buddy mama's not that cool these are struggle dogs right here we gotta make these last till dad's disability check comes in yeah i don't know if you know this but making a pack of hebrew nationals last eight days that's actually white trash hanukkah thanks you know it was a good relationship while it lasted out i'm not bitter you know things end um and we had we had a good time we had a good sex life you know we were really into role playing anybody here role play nice what do we do huh say it again schoolgirl classic very nice yeah that's good as who's the is this like teacher school girl or just like school girl school girl school girl now we're talking wow a twist on an old classic  the bud light lime of role-playing  nice hell yeah i really like role-playing because i always pick a guy that comes really fast that's my that's my character there's a guy that busts quick and then plays nba 2k for like a half hour i really commit to that one i'm sort of a method actor when it comes to that one yeah i could tell though in hindsight that that relationship was kind of losing some steam you know i think you can tell in the way you initiate sex when the passion starts to go you know like when we first started dating we'd go on these long dates we'd talk for hours there'd be a spark we'd kiss i'd be like wow this is really gonna happen the way i knew we're gonna have sex at the end of the relationship is if i went to the bathroom and she was like wash your hands with soap this time like hell yeah dude nice why she want him clean huh she's not trying to get crumbs in there that's why  i'm about to have sex it was good though i did you know it was i learned a lot about myself being in a long-term relationship you know like i learned i'm i'm more traditional in some ways than i realize even though i consider myself a feminist overall you know like do i want my girlfriend to shave her legs yes but i will allow her to support me financially so i'm sort of a modern guy in that sense thank you yeah please i'm just doing my part no i'm a feminist though you know that part's real and i think my my favorite part of feminism is the concept of mansplaining you know because basically that means men aren't allowed to explain anything anymore which means i could just be dumb as hell right like if one of my friends if she's like hey would you look at this book i'd be like nice try i see what you're up to but i'm not reading anymore i'm a feminist thank you very much  yeah but anyway that relationship's over it's been over for a while i've just been out there just a fat little just thank you just toss this little wiener around town you know what i mean just throwing this five and three quarters everywhere you know six on it's tippy toes don't worry uh was this summer as as you guys thought it was going to be no right it wasn't that good right it pissed me off i was ready dude everyone was building it up and was like we've been locked up for a year people are going crazy they're gonna be sucking and in the streets you know that was not my experience i have to be honest i think what happened is everybody was very excited everybody was like went out one time got crazy and then looked around and was like uh this shit's still pretty bad out here actually the president just has a different kind of dimension now no one's really fixed anything but there's less funny tweets now um yeah i was pissed dude i was ready for this horny summer right i grew my hair out for this you know what i mean i was bald when the pandemic started i was like it dude let's see what happens i'm trying to get my tugged on you know what i mean but it didn't happen dude i had big plans i was trying to get pegged by somebody's wife on a hammock you know some big naturals on my shoulders but the best laid plants of mice and men you know what i mean  yeah i was having this conversation with my gay friends right i was talking about the summer and i was complaining and they're like what do you mean you don't have sex we're having sex all the time but that's not fair you guys a gay guy making fun of a straight guy for not having enough sex is like a harlem globetrotter making fun of an nba player for not scoring enough points you know it's like come on man no one plays defense in your league  a lot of showmanship yeah a lot of confetti but not a lot of fundamentals that's all i'm saying  yeah i don't know i'm 32 you know maybe it's time i started doing some gay you know looks like fun you know like no one's ever come in my mouth but i love an over easy egg how different could it really be be honest with yourselves right now it's probably pretty close throw a little tabasco on the guy's you know what i mean take me to brunch big dog are some pissed off dudes in the ground right now hard scramble from now on i will not have gay eggs no i don't know maybe that's a little far for me too is uh sucking a man off with hot sauce in my mouth but i want to expand the sexual repertoire a little bit you know i want some new moves i've been doing some different stuff i've been doing the pineapple thing you know supposed to make it taste better uh but everybody hates it no matter how much pineapple i put in my foreskin and i don't what just chunk after chunk what am i doing wrong that might be the stupidest thing i say tonight here's my real move though you know here it is because i was always jealous when you're hooking up with a girl and then she puts her hair up like suggestively and it's like oh you know what's coming next you know that's why what i've been doing is when i'm hooking up with a girl and i'm about to go down on her i take out a huge bib huh that's my move i better not hear about anybody in la doing the bib okay that's mine and you definitely cannot say my compliments to the chef afterwards that ties it all together but i've been out there i've been dating a little bit you know i was dating mostly younger women uh not on purpose just cause no one my age wants to be with me you know like i'm 32 girls my age want like stability you know they want like a real job health insurance i could get you mushrooms pretty easily you know like that's the style of 30 year old i am i don't know what an ira is but i have acid on me right now sometimes people are condescending if you date somebody younger they'll be like oh i'm sure the conversation was very intellectually stimulating and you know what i'm very stupid so yeah it was i'm learning a lot from these girls a lot about astrology i'll tell you that much they love the stuff everyone's pretty freaky now too i realize everyone i feel like has to bust in a strange way you know like a girls with recently wanted to be tied up and then also pretend she was sleeping and it's like i could just go you know what i mean like if that's what it's gonna take to me i'll head home no hard feelings i don't want to sound like a prude right i'm not trying to kink shame up here tying up is fun even the sleeping i guess i don't have a problem with my issue with that situation is that she has no use of her hands and i've never successfully had sex without the guiding vagina hand move  you know that move well there goes like an electrician trying to connect two wires oh just like a real i 98 know where a is but that last two percent i really need help with uh  yeah i'm not that i'm not that good at rough sex i think it's because i love my mom too much she called me a reason she's like hey how's your love life going it's like not great because of all the support you showed me as a child would it have killed you to miss a football practice every once in a while i have no resentment towards women i can barely choke this girl mom you're embarrassing me right now i'll choke you though don't worry i will uh no problem it's not my favorite but it's fine some people though they love it right some people that's how they have morning sex that is crazy to me right there's birds chirping outside you're smelling pancakes from next door you're just like  come on man there's a fresh morning due outside children are going to school right now let the prices right come on first show some decorum even dirty talk you know i feel like you're doing me a really nice favor having sex with me i don't want to say a bunch of rude things to you right that's not how you treat a bud doing a favor right your friend helps you move you're like yeah get that ottoman you little just putting my fingers in my friend jeff's mouth pick up the credenza jeffy duh you little mover  uh here's another move somebody asked me to pull was one of these was just a choke finger combo you know just like a real is that is that still sex you guys i gotta be honest it didn't feel like sex it felt like gynecology in the 1400s you know like i felt like i was punishing a witch more than anything it felt like we called her learning how to read for the crime of female literacy little pilgrim hat ah  if she squirts she's a witch   yeah i've been out there you know i've been on some sexual voyages you know you know i've had to my way out of a couple jams uh had a couple threesomes didn't all go my way i'll be honest with you guys anybody here threesome yeah how'd it go pretty well you guess all right nice how who were these people uh you got hit up on tinder by a woman's account a man's account a woman at 4am all right nice just out of the blue they're like this is the guy i need huh wow sure of course you're like you're yeah you're just like all right just check i'll make sure my kidney is here the next morning that is you weren't getting too much  before i'm guessing right they caught you in a drought they caught you in a big dry spell you're like i could die it's 4 a.m i have to work in the morning it's 75 right now but buy gum i might just get double sucked so and who are these women what are they looking like when you get in do the pictures look similar yeah wow already cut and dry like you're hanging uh you're doing shingles on their roof they're like yeah wasn't too much water damage everything was looking pretty good getting an app job all right so how quickly until you're in the house is your penis breathing fresh air would you say uh like an hour and a half hour and a half so you warmed up a little bit that's nice right yeah sure sure sure wow it's a mexican standoff okay and then after they've vetted you for 90 minutes they're like this is good we'll we can  this guy um okay and then how is it good that everybody bust just not me just not you what get the out of here the rare the guy doesn't come and the two girls one guy they gave you adderall what the is going on wow respect to these girls did they give you dick pills in adderall that's a that's a dangerous combination and you don't bust and you're just  you're driving you're taking a  40-minute uber home you're like dick on titanium just that was pretty cool  and you know what that's a fond memory for you isn't it you're gonna be on your deathbed just like smiling your grandchild is gonna be like what is it papa and you're gonna be thinking about not busting to two i'm gonna guess marilyn five and a half there's no way there's no way these were hot women right everything we know we can kind of through echolocation understand they were ugly and you're gonna be thinking about not coming with these women then you're gonna look at him and be like uh how much i love grandma  nice how about a nice hand for our friend over here huh  anybody else any other threesomes it seems like a pretty over here raising your glass yeah is that the i had a threesome salute how'd it go not too well yeah i felt by the way shouts out a fellow man of size getting his dick sucked by two women   who were what was the situation for you it looked like me all right i don't know why the i have to be disparaged in this and you're the one who them i look like me you two people that look like me how am i how am i getting dragged into this you could have said they look like you you know what i'm saying we're not too far off pal there's a lot of different ways you could have phrased that that doesn't throw me under the bus okay so you were having a threesome in your weight class it sounds like this was more of a wrestling match than a sexual encounter  where did you meet these people vegas nice okay so just three people down on their luck just deciding to trying to have a plus-sized three-way yeah that's good that's good for the community i like that how many people came for you only oh there we go we've got the yin and yang of bad threesomes over here i love it yeah my mine was mine was closer to yours than his but i'll tell my story now uh my threesome did not go good either uh i was surprised first of all i didn't think it was gonna happen uh and and also the day of my threesome it started with a 40 chinese food order that was breakfast for me you know what i mean just me by the way that's forty dollars me and it was one of those things where i was waiting i was like 10 59 11. hello yes i'd like to i was like ordering chinese food like i'm waiting for star wars you know and so 40 chinese food breakfast there's a real ceiling to your day when that's how it starts right and i was also coming off the heels of a tender bender which is when you have chicken tenders every day for two weeks in a row right so i'm not where you need to be nutritionally speaking for a threesome right um so i'm actually this girl on tinder and she's gonna come to my show that night but she's bringing a friend but so in my mind i'm like okay she's coming to a public place she's bringing a friend she wants to check out the vibes and if you know if the vibes are right maybe we go on a date next week just me and her maybe we next week right but there's no sexual pressure on this situation i just have to be a cute charming little guy and uh i think we all know how that's gonna go right so we get there and it's a fun time you know the conversation's going really well her friend's cool she's cool um and but you know like i said i don't think i'm gonna so i'm gonna keep eating right because it's one of the other folks uh i got a real problem and uh so we're chatting and i'm just eating like an ass i'm eating the way like a cartoon villain eats you know what i mean i'm just like they're talking just like sliders you know just like a fish haul the bones come out like that situation and it's going good but i'm getting sleepy because i've had a lot of carbs right and i'm about to talk to the girl i match with and be like hey this was fun let's hang out some other time but before i can make that pitch i look over at them and they're being really weird they're like texting each other and i'm like hey girls what's going on and they're like oh nothing we were thinking like maybe we should all go back to my place and and uh i was like yeah yes that's what i was also thinking that's what i'm prepared for right now but what am i going to do what i'm going to be like my tummy hoes huh i can't get i had too many tweets to get tonight i can't do that right so i'm like it i'm gonna thug this out we'll be fine so we're driving back to their place right and uh the whole time i'm doing this thing i don't know fellas if you ever done this we try and make your dick hard with your mind have you ever done that just do a little check-in and i'm just in there like nothing no movement whatsoever right but i'm like no big deal i'm gonna get in this room it's gonna be me and four titties i'm gonna be good to go right uh and at first i'm right at first it rocks i'm in there just me and four titties i don't know if you've ever seen have you seen one of those videos where they give a baby hearing aids for the first time you ever see one of those i'm just in there like ah i'm having the time in my life brother it's going awesome but then very quickly the chinese food comes back to haunt me right i just i'm hitting them with dumpling dick you know just think of a couple soup dumplings stacked on top of each other you know very wobbly like optically i'm hard but there is no structural integrity to my penis whatsoever yeah it's tough i'm doing this move a lot i'm doing the okay sign you ever done that where it's like yeah no it's hard yeah no it's hard it's actually definitely hard can you check can you check again my dick is hard for sure like my credit card is getting declined i'm like yeah i called my bank they said my dick was hard so can you check   i'm blowing it dude i'm stalling for so i'm eating for so long you could have just watched all of rush hour too the amount of time i'm eating one of them just falls asleep in the middle of it you know you know you're not laying it down when you lose a participant mid threesome right yeah i'm like this is brutal this is horrific we gotta end this uh so i guess what i'm gonna have to do is jack off and leave and uh that's what i did and in hindsight it's crazy that was my plan right why the did i do that like oh hey girls i've just been sexually disappointing you for two hours in a row i'm gonna make a small mess in your home and get out of here that's all right with you and it was an angry went to it was one of those get the poison outs you know just like a real  i want to be free so i do that i'm just standing in this  hallway dealing with a devastating bout of post not clarity and i'm like wow this is it this is a tough l this is this is the worst one of my life probably uh but you know what that's okay because we can rebuild from this right it's only up from here this is rock bottom so i'm gonna do it i'm gonna  rebuild my life and like that like the phoenix i'll rise from these sexual ashes right and that's what i do eight months go by my shit's going great my life's going better and better and better things are going really good and then out of the blue i get a text from these girls and they're like hey wanna again and i'm like this is a prank right like i'm gonna get to their apartment it's gonna be all my enemies you know haha dude we knew you couldn't hahaha  but that wasn't it was really them they wanted to hook up again and i wasn't going to ask too many questions right they had a whole little plan you know they had the day off from work uh they were gonna go to the museum and then come over to my place after which is a very european afternoon you know like look at paintings and a fat guy with a little mustache that's that's parisian you know what i mean and i had a plan too i wasn't going out the same way this is redemption you know what i mean i'm hitting the elliptical i'm i'm drinking green juices i'm drinking kombuchas i buy 80 worth of illegal indian viagra off the internet just from a guy that worked at a research lab he was like yeah just venmo me and put lunch that's just comes in an unmarked vial i'm just like i take so much of it and uh my dick it worked my dick got hard as but uh the rest of my body was failing you know like i was just and my joints were locking up i'm just in there cold sweat you know like the eyesight of my left eye is flickering like a light bulb in a haunted house and i'm like this is it this is how i deserve to die this is overdosing on dick pills and if that's how i went i wouldn't even want an open casket you know i would want a glory hole casket you know just everyone come and pay in their last respects you know  he was such a good boy  yeah and so obviously the threesome wasn't good but there was one good part in the beginning and that's when i was i was uh eating while getting my dick sucked and it felt like i was sucking my own dick through a portal and that that was the best moment of my life i gotta be honest guys thank you so much that's it we did it hell yeah thank you     you

York-area airports."" That's awesome, man. I still don't know what's actually going on with you,
but I don't— it doesn't really— We don't need
to find out. That was— The fiction we concocted is better
than reality, for sure. Anybody here

Oh, okay. Nice. Okay. Nice. Are you guys
happy about it? —That's good.

maybe somebody who's not happy
about a child. No, that's good.
You guys are good. You got jobs and sh*t? —It's looking good?
—Yeah. Yeah. You have, like,
childcare lined up? —Yeah.

you guys too? —Why did you—
—No. —It was actually—
—Why do you think your family got— —He struck gold on the
housing crisis. Your dad struck gold
on the housing crisis? And he was like, ""See ya b*tch!""
to your mom? He was like,
""I'm up, b*tch! ""I'm in a different tax bracket
and so is my p*$$y from now on."" Damn, that's sucks dude. Do you have like a— Does he have a trophy
wife now? —Uh, no. —He made
a lot of money. —Not good with women. —Great with money. Great, not good with— Okay, so he's never— So you've never had like
a stepmom either after this? —Uh no, I grew up
with a single mom. Single mom. —Where's your pops?

""I got to go buy —""more houses.""
—What did I say before? Huh? Check your attitude. Hey, listen, relax. —He's up.
—Huh? —He's up.
—He's up? —Okay.
—We're not. I get that. All, right, I'm not him.
You understand that, right? I'm not— I don't know why the f*ck you're
talking to me like I'm your dad that left. I'm just asking
questions, dude. I think
he's a piece of sh*t. Just don't f*cking
yell at me, you know? if you had this
attitude around the house, you
know, I don't know. I'm just saying, you're not exactly
giving him a lot of reasons to stay. I'm kidding. If I'm out here giving f*cking real estate bucks
and I'm getting sassed. No, I'm kidding. Damn. You don't even know where he is? —Uh, not really. You don't even know
where he is? Damn, real piece of sh*t, huh? And you never—
Your mom never remarried or anything? —Uh, yeah.
I got a stepdad now. You got a stepdad? Nice. All right.
Is he cool? —Pretty cool. Pretty cool? —He is pretty cool. —Things turned around. Things turned around? Yeah. What about you? Why'd your—
Was your dad that same kind of piece of sh*t? —Kind of like the housing crisis,
you know? What is going on with
the hou— What the f*ck is going on? That's not true. There's no way. Well first of all, yours
is not the housing crisis. It's, doesn't line
up, motherf*cker. It doesn't make sense. Did you guys
all rehearse this? What the f*ck is going on? You just met him? I feel like I'm being
had right now. I feel like this is some
long con that I'm gonna fall into. They're like, ""Yeah, dude, actually. ""All right,
my dad has a really ""good investment
opportunity."" They're gonna come up
to me afterwards. ""Dude, you can't miss. ""All we need is 10 G's
 up front right now."" Okay, what's— How did the housing
crisis play into your parents'
divorce? —I mean, money got tight. Money got tight. —They probably weren't meant
to be together. —Okay.
—They actually got divorced 16 years ago
yesterday. Wow, jeez. That's a
sad anniversary. Huh? —We originally thought it was
an April Fools' joke. Oh wow,
they got divorced on April Fools'? Your parents suck dead. How old were you? —Uh, I was probably
like 8. You were 8? Oh my God. And then— And you were like,
""Nice one, mom and dad. ""Oh, yeah. ""I'm sure you guys are
divorced."" That's
so f*cking funny. That's so sh*tty. I was like,
""Why does he know?"" But it's like, that's a pretty
funny reason to know. ""Oh, dad's really
taking this far. ""He's packing up
all his stuff, ""and mom's having sex
with our neighbor, Mike. ""You guys,
I'll give you credit, ""you're really committing
to the joke."""

who break their legs on a dirt bike deserve to be able to 
feed their families, alright? This is great. This man— This man is 
a beneficiary of socialism right here Let me guess I wonder if your father votes that way  “Yeah Bernie Sanders, 
that’s my fuckin kinda guy” “We gotta fuckin
redistribute da wealth” “Fuckin Jeff Bezos” “If I fuckin get my fuckin hands on him…”"

problem but let me tell you right now the number one reason people hate america the number one reason is because of our religion americans worship money we worship money separate god from school separate god from work separate god from government but on your money it says in god we trust all my life i've been looking for god and he's right in my pocket americans worship money and we all go to the same church the church at atm everywhere you look there's a new branch popping up reminding you about how much money you got or how much money you don't got and if you got less than twenty dollars the machine won't even talk to you the machine's like you better go see a teller you ever gonna tell him trying to take out eight dollars and fifty cent oh it's disgusting oh man you gotta wait on that long ass line people doing real transactions in front of you you get up to the  front you fill out your form 850. the  teller looks at it she look at you she looks at the  she don't even take the money out the drawer she take it out a pocket  drugs are illegal but atm machines are open 24 hours a day 24 hours a day for who who the  is it open for have you ever taken out three hundred dollars at four o'clock in the morning for something positive  when you press that machine at four o'clock in the morning i think a psychiatrist should pop up on the screen and go come on man save your money man don't buy drugs buy some rims they spin it  they spill it they spill it  they spill don't know i like older women i'm in the older women they're not you know you know not wheezy jefferson old  just older than me cause young girls are full of  they like what they like so i wanted to be this tall one's hair to be like this one's eyes to be like this i'm going the wall like this talk like this work here all this  i got nothing to do with head here now you get an older woman you got an older woman single she's like hey i just want a man he got a dick and a job i'm happy  you know what you know what else older women cook all the women will cook you up some  all the women know the power of the pop they will make you some young girl can't make nothing reservation  all the women know the power of the pot so they got all these shows on tv oprah and sally jesse and all this  telling women how to get a man all these books how to get a man you're women you want to get a man that's what you do you put a pot on a stove every day at six o'clock a man will show up to that puck  yo fellas in my line  hell no a pot on a stove every day not once a week not twice a week every  day at six o'clock a man meant from miles around that you have never met who shot to that pot but i got all this  how to get a man you dress like this and do your hair like this and walk like this and talk like this and sexist and sex that anybody can suck a dick  but gravy's a whole nother story  but i would take a sweet potato pie over a big ass any day i will drop kick a girlfriend with a banana pudding ice cold banana putting this in the refrigerator all night get your ass  that's right it's damn near impossible for a man to turn down sex it's for a man to turn down sexy we can stop chasing it and even that requires some rehab but it's hard for a man to stop whoa return what if it chases us we can't run that fast they're gonna catch us we're like ah  pull the hands straight he got me got me got me you can't run that fast see it's easy for women to turn down sex it ain't  for y'all to turn down sex it ain't no thing for y'all to turn down sex you're like how come you i can't you turn it down i do it all the time i do it all the time why can't you say no i say no see it's easy for y'all you know why because every woman in here ever since she was 13 every guy you met's been trying to  you that's right women are offered dick every day every woman in here gets off a dick at least three times a week three times a day  that's right every time a man's being nice to you all he's doing is offering dick that's all it is it's all it is that's all it is uh oh oh can i get that for you how about some dick  oh could i help you with that can i help you some dick do you need some dick nobody offers us  we got to fend for ourselves we can't believe it we get off and we're like damn that's my lucky day i'm 21 i live at home i gotta move out i have to move out because everybody in my neighborhood nobody ever moves out i have friends that are 28 years old and live at home but this is pathetic there's nothing more pathetic than a 28 year old man that lives at home only one thing and that's any woman willing to sneak into his room so once you pay taxes you shouldn't have to tiptoe past anybody and i live at home and my mother likes to clean up my room and whenever my mother cleans up my room she always takes out all my dirty magazines whenever your mother takes you dirty magazines you can't say anything about it if she don't say nothing you don't say nothing okay to play it off like they were never there in the first place you're sitting there eating breakfast eating breakfast with your mother and there's like attention at the breakfast table because you're not like her little baby anymore you're like some pervert she's giving birth to so you try to strike up any kind of conversation you know like ma have you seen my baseball glove your mother goes well maybe you left it in the penthouse sometimes you don't find out until it's like too late it's like three o'clock in the morning you need your book before you go to bed right you look around so you have to search the whole house for any picture with a woman on it and finally you settle for aunt jemima  sad sad sad i don't know man a lot of women here tonight that's good i like women my mother's a woman that helps you know what cool thing about women women get to have platonic friends he's my pal he's my bud he's my platonic friend i love him like a brother he's my bud my platonic friend men don't have platonic friends okay we just have women we haven't  yet as soon as i figure this out i'm in there i mean i mean we got some platonic frisbee oh no i got something but they all by accident every platonic friend i got to show them when i was trying to  i made a wrong turn somewhere and ended up in the friend zone oh no i'm in the friendzone  women keep platonic friends forever why because you never know that's right they give her to girlfriends every six months what happened to pam she thinks she's cute but they keep them platonic friends forever why because you never know what happened to cow i can't hang with her but they keep them platonic friends forever why because you never know you know what a platonic friend is to a woman it's like a dick in a glass case  in case of emergency break open glass  and fellas if your woman got platonic friends that's who she'll be  when you mess up one of them guys you ain't even thinking about boys she'd be crying on the show they can't believe this happened i'm so glad you're here  that's right it's gonna happen to you you know the next man to  your woman you've met him he's been in your house he's ate your food he's drank your wine and he shall betray you women got it good one thing i learned about women guys never ask a woman how many men she slept with because you don't want to know just be happy you're  now why you want to know you ain't discovering  you ain't putting a flag nowhere just be happy you're getting it now why why why you want to know why why why why why first of all no matter what she's saying it's too much for you no matter what she said she can go two you'd be like two who who no no i guess that's how you was raised  why you wanna make it wrong because she's gonna lie women are lie about how many guys she  in court they don't care yeah i swear yeah and she says three that's 10. so you got to give every woman like a seven dick curve that's more like three dicks to the eighth power and women y'all think you're slick y'all ain't slick i know the game i'm watching them for boy you ask the woman how many guys she  she's not gonna tell you how many guys she  she'll tell you how many boyfriends she had because women only count their boyfriends that's right they don't count all those miscellaneous dicks they had   you know that guy they met at the club the guy they  from the club that night oh that time they  bobby brown oh oh the guy they  jamaica that's another country it don't count i thought we just talking about domestic dick that's right man and everybody talking about gun control gotta get rid of the guns  that i like guns you got a gun you don't have to work out i ain't working out i ain't jogging you got pets i got texts oh that's  you don't need no gun control you know what you need we need some bullet control we need to make we need to control the bullets that's right i think all bullets should cost five thousand dollars five thousand dollars for a bullet you know why because if a bullet costs five thousand dollars there'll be no more innocent bystanders  every time somebody gets shot at me like damn he mustered this song said they put 50 000 other bullets in his head and people would think before they killed somebody if a bullet cost five thousand dollars man i would blow your  head off if i could afford it i'm gonna give me another job i'm gonna start saving some money and you a dead man you better hope i can't get no bullets on lay away so even if you get shot by a straight bullet you won't have to go to no doctor to get it taken out whoever shot you and take they pull it back i believe you got my property well i don't know women you know cool thing about women i like about a woman can fall in love with an ugly man and admit it show him off to all her friends in the family be the ugliest guy in the world and i'll be so proud of that ugly man to hold his hand drag him around the place introduce some people like this is kevin i want you to be kevin i know he's not that attractive but he's good to me men aren't like a man will never admit to being in love with an ugly woman okay we'll hide that  to the depth we ain't telling nobody see we could be getting measured hey man i heard you get married who told you that don't spread the rumors all right you know some of you women don't know if they're ugly or not can't give yourselves a test just a little test don't be scared yo if you've been over a guy's house more than four times been  every time and haven't met anybody in the house he don't think you look that good every time you go over all you see is one room but i gotta pee hold it in i know that's me i know that's me man we got one more this  but won't take out oh that's me that's right we got when we just  but won't take you out for women y'all just as mean y'all got men to let take out but you won't  these guys on dates right now ain't getting  so yeah i'm loosing her up a little comedy she's like ain't nothing that funny that's right you can't ha-ha your way into this see that's the problem man we always think we could buy sex like if i take it here she give me something but by this she give me something nothing gets you nothing should a woman know she's gonna  you within the first five minutes of meeting you women know on the handshake they shaking hands like i'mma  him i hope he don't say nothing stupid that's right can't say nothing stupid because women are all about the mood that's right she's in the mood to shut up let it happen so if you say the wrong thing them pages are coming up fast and you can win god excuse me what you're saying i'm telling you man no relationships rough easy to get in one easy to get in a relationship hard to maintain you know it's like in marriage marriage to me is not even a natural state to be married for life anything for life just promotes laziness okay that shouldn't be for life man should be like a driver's license five years and renew  to love that fourth year who would be good man it's rough man it's hard man it's hard to maintain a relationship man because at some point no matter who it is at some point you have heard everything this person has to say you heard it all you know what they get ready to say before they even say it you remember that time yeah i remember they ever tell you yeah you told me you have heard it all and then what happens you stop talking have a breakdown of communication yet you gotta talk cause women love to talk women love to talk they are talking in the olympics a man wouldn't stand a chance women love to talk and feathers women don't want us to talk to them they just want us to set them up that's all women want you to do if you're in a relationship with a woman it's like being in a comedy team and you're the straight man just set her up feel the lines all the women want you to do is go how was your day that's all the  they want how was your day because how was your day is a half hour conversation to a woman it's a whole half hour and you as the man the only thing you got to do is go uh-huh get out of here really get out of here i told you that  is crazy but eventually hey women you talk too much you do you got to learn how to turn it down a little bit you ever notice no man comes straight home no man comes straight home every man in here has to go somewhere as soon as he gets off work he got to go drink something snort something shoot something in his veins something to get him ready for the talking that he's about to hear something that dead in his senses and women it's not that you talk too much you talk too much soon as we get in the house as soon as we get it done you ain't gonna let me get in the  house let me get my other foot in there  come on let me read the paper let me have something to eat let me take a  damn yeah i gotta go y'all be cool but wait a minute there's one exception there's one exception there's one instance where white people can say  and i'm gonna let it out tonight i'm gonna let it out here in johannesburg the one time that white people can say  and white people like this is what i paid for  it's a  great night now the one time white people could say  here goes listen closely because i may never say this  again the one time white people could say  okay if it's christmas eve and it's between 4 30 and 4 49 in the morning if you white and you on your way to toys r us to get your kid the last transformer dog and right before you walk in the toys r us some black person runs up beside you smacks you in the head with a brick knocks you to the ground stomps

police report in your pocket case any black people catch you saying  the police report will act as your freedom payments hey i heard you're saying  let me see your  papers give me the background shout

Chris Rock,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-EbQ_Dp5w0,"yeah  and he leaves down and picks up a little  13 miles to the left right now pictures of the zebra and I was having a good time and I'm out there with my family and I felt great - I look over at another Jeep and I saw a bunch of white people taking pictures of me but they had a tracker tracking my black ass evidently I must have dropped some chicken of some chicken bowl 35 to none that  will be there this is the time to be onstage just the time to do a special man cuz this is a special time a lots going on right now that's right big election year in the United States that's right it ain't your election but you paying attention you damn right you are that's right George Bush has  up so bad he's made it hard for a white man rough president give me a black man a white woman a giraffe of zebra anything but another white man that last one  up my roof and what do we have running for president who the hell is running for president we got two guys man got John McCain John McCain 72-year oh he was too old ten years ago oh man I don't need a president with a bucket list  how many 72 people did you see today just doing  people don't even use old people to do  72 you see hottest nurse to be his vice president sarah palin out there shooting mooses and  holding up the mooses   Michael Vick in jail for make decisions about the future when you ain't gonna be here you know the  too old when you die at 72 no matter what you die of it's natural causes even if you here get hit by truck its natural causes cuz if you was younger you know got out the way you know you got a real theis man Baraka McCain they they China they tryna McCain just got that old story smoke  telling the same story but 40  years he a war hero be a war hero feel war hero that got captured a lot of guys in jail they got cats you  nobody got captured I wanna vote for the  that got away that's what we got man so who's he running up against Oh I know I need that black here but in America that's about as black as her name could get oh that's right next to the kid favorite um food i say broccoli he don't let his blackness sneak up on you you know up his name was Bob Jones or something might take it two or three weeks to realize he black well soon as you hit Barack Obama you expect to see a brother with a spear just standing on top of the deadline for Obama you expect to see the bass player from the Commodores come out  I'm talking about shining  behind Oh never seen a brother like oh no nice looking brother yo yo every time I see four Rock'em life so when you getting back with new addition this young brother my god and Barack is so calm and cool sometimes I think he doesn't even realize he's the black candidate like he thinks he can win this thing fair and square the most votes is gonna be so see table change this whole system off his black ass over tonight you better ask the end is about white men and rules  they will change all this  with a straight face stupid hey man you got the most votes too bad your mouth that's how we used to do it we don't really count votes that much snowball and they in Barack's ass whoever Barack no is being investigated if you know Barack Obama they are stay on tapping your phone right now yeah in your ass and that's what McCain has the advantage cuz all his friends are dead yeah but this this whole election is so is so weird just the way they report on it the way that the way they cover it does everything so racial racial racial we have how many white people are voting how many working-class white people how many white people over four foot eight are voting for Barack Obama you know you know the crazy thing is whenever white people vote for Barack Obama which is a lot of the time they go well you know they listen to the issues and they felt Obama spoke to their issues they went over the issues they weighed the pros and cons and they felt that Obama spoke to their issues I guess that's why pictures of milkshake don't get me wrong don't get me wrong we are very excited about Barack Obama we black people very excited about for us about just because he's black boom fun because he's black in qualified that's why we behind them leave a flavor for 20 years I love the flavor of love show I think it's quite entertaining the Labour flag must be killed in order for black people to truly reach the promised land labour flag has to be shot these are important times we got a black man running for president we don't need a  running around with a  clock around his neck in a bike it not this year flame not this year no we're very we're very very very excited very excited I tell you this right now white people are here if Barack Obama wears if you have any activity in your life that involves black people that are supposed to happen today after election day it will not get done election day is Tuesday that Wednesday don't schedule no black  like if you gotta fly ain't nobody carrying your bags you got to get your own  back we got a black president  yeah it's not being hard for Barack Obama to be President because Barack Obama has to overcome a handicap but the other candidate does not have to overcome that's right it's going to be hard with Barack Obama to be President because Barack Obama has a black wife and I don't think a black woman can be First Lady of the United States cuz the black woman cannot play the background of a relationship  could be president with no problem first lady too much shutting up in that job can you imagine telling your black wife that you president honey I want I'm president no we president and I want my girlfriend's in the cabinet  I want Kiki to be second tear defense she can fight she's a fire no no you can't have no black person ad that's too much work for the Secret Service is we can't let her through sir we can't let her through it's my  wife man she's gonna kill you that's a brocco baba really want to be the president he got to give him a white girl yeah I said it why cuz the white girl a player position the black girl wanna play your position you wanted a quarterback guard hi hi she right next to you hi hi we can't both hi that's right you get you a white girl she do exactly what you needed to do I need you to run left slant right okay daddy I got you and you wear wool black women get mad when I say that  oh you need a white girl you think you need a white girl think you need a white girl soon as y'all get little bunny you want a white girl so did you get a little money or what a white girl actually before we get money  oh no way I'm gonna bring it back that's gonna get pissed off at some interracial dating boy black women get Madame black women get angrier than southern white men Oh especially if they see a white girl with a famous black man wouldn't get  bad they see like a white girl with Denzel Washington they  start shaking me ready to punch that white girl in the face you do it with dibs I'm trying to take our good black men we only got eight right like we get mad they get mad at us black man get mad cuz they get mad at us because we like to exercise all variety that's right that's right black men like to exercise they for ride when the black man is looking for me we check out the whole menu of women we're like oh you got any specials you get all up in your grill that's right but they act like they mad at the black man but no they're not mad at us they met it themselves that's right yeah I said it you are mad at your sad cuz I'm gonna tell you the real reason black women get so mad at interracial damn I wanna break it up  down to that the real reason black women get so mad at interracial dating but it's most black women the real reason black women get so angry and interracial dating is because black women are not attracted to white men don't don't get me wrong but a pretty white boy Matthew McConaughey of George Clooney Brad Pitt don't get better some  yes the bigger the better it's just no white - now there's white women in this room right now don't even have scales and nail house they know they came and wait with too many black guys start hitting

financial straits girl what you doin him it was gonna take my car yes yes yes man yes yes yes man so let's let's go back to election for a second mem it don't matter who wins this election right now don't matter the rocky or McCain don't matter right now Bush is still in charge George Bush is still in charge and nobody gives less than George Bush   night Bush is unbelievable man this guy's

the player hate the game Oh black people who are these black people waters me mary j blige jay-z in anymore only black people let's break it down let's break it down me I'm a decent comedian my marriage a plies project lies one of the greatest armies singers to ever walk the earth jay-z's one of the greatest rappers to ever live Eddie Murphy one of the funniest actors to ever do it do you know what the white man that lives next door to me does for a living he's a  Dennis he ain't the best Guinness in the world here you go up to the dental Hall of Fame you don't get plaques for getting rid of plaque he's just a gank yo tooth out Dennis see the black man got to give something just in case the white people that really own the place show up one day time to go black him damn I knew this day would come good swing I'm back do you know what a black difference would have to do to move into my neighborhood be that they invent me rise to the man race is about them only thing that makes me more angry than racism only one thing makes me more angry than racism is black people that are shocked at racism to whatever something racist goes down they always manage to find one black person that can't believe it say that you from a white person could ever say to me that will ever catch me sitting down with Regis filming doing an interview talking about Madagascar to say yeah Regis Madagascar to real good man I play I play a zebra again oh this one's great and right in the middle of the interview Regis a pull-up pigma we live in a crazy time man we live in an insane time man we live in a time where it was you if you say the wrong thing you in trouble we live in this is the first time in the history of the world where white men actually after watch what they said white men are getting in trouble for saying the wrong words man it's unbelievable man and a lot of white guys hate me inspector you can say whatever you want you can say  yeah when I last checked that was the only advantage I had to be a black you want to switch places you scream  and I'll raise interest rates the first time and it needs to be at the world will Whiteman watch do you know why so don't don't worry about it you know that's how life works man that's how life works sometimes the people with the most  have to shut up and let other people talk  about that's how life works that's right sometime two people with the most  get to say deletion and the people with ly  get to say motion so if you want to say most  get rid of some of your  that's how the world works man some people get to talk about other people and that time that's just how it goes man for instance like fat girls can say whatever they want to about skinny girls fat girls can talk about skinny girls all day long  skinny it's fine skinny ass anorexic bulimic   cheerio salad girls just be they freebase great food is not your friend it's not your friend for instance short guys to talk about tall guys all day long short guys to say whatever they walk to about tall guys bastard but dog guys can't talk about short guys that's just me look at these   like poor people could talk about rich people all day long poor means to say whatever they want to about rich people  rich fashion I hope your yacht hits an iceberg in the summer  Casso falls off the wall and kills your mother  rich bastard what rich people can't talk about poor people that's just me I look at these bastards perhaps we should raise the prices so we don't have to see these people again is that with cloth interior yes man that's right you gotta watch what you say even some black people have to watch what they say even some black people gotta watch it they say right what's my man on Grey's Anatomy got got got fired but Claire got fired but cause somebody a  yeah we live in a crazy time you gotta watch it you say baby between the internet and all these shows you say the wrong thing go career is over but here it is a crazy thing man it's not about the words sometimes man it ain't about the words all bad words ain't bad and sometimes it's about the context in which the word is said it's not always the word it's the context in which the word is said so if you say something you know spending on what you talking about you know you say some like man your finest  I ever seen that's a compliment it ain't the word it's the context in which the word is being system my man Oh blaze Anatomy it ain't that he calls somebody a  it's like how did he say  how did he say did he come in early one day go mornin back cuz if he did he should be fine but how did he say what was he ever fight what this person was he having an argument with his personal relationship of some sort how did he say he was having a bang personally if you having a fight with somebody you should be able to say whatever you think is gonna hurt this person the most well I gotta be politically correct and mad at the same time like if I'm driving there's somebody crashes into me and they got one leg hey you one-legged bastard no wonder you can't break I hope you got some two-legged in Shauna's well how did he say  is a real question nobody wants to what if the person that he called the  was acting like a  and I'm not trying to disrespect any gay people I have gay friends I know I have gay fans I know some of y'all here tonight I just want to say thanks for the money I'm all for gay rights I hope you get the right to get married and buy cereal I think gay fans are some of the best fans now you never see no gay homeless people there's no gay homeless people there's no Asian homeless people that's just the homeless rules the homeless discriminate yes they do I think they would be more understanding but where was I what if the person that he called the  to be like anybody connect like a  let me give you example Gwen Stefani I think no doubt is one of the best groups in the world I keep a no doubt CD in my car and I sing that  don't speak I know just  just say I won't even get out my car to the  so farm like you know you're good     you have to write to go she even Elton John would call me a  at that moment it's not the world it's the context in which the word is being said that's the tone I think the words the contest now speaking of words now they're trying to get rid of the word  trying to get rid of my beloved   lash it n double acp had a had a funeral for the word  well tonight is Easter that's right whenever the word  is spoken it is always followed by the same question can white people say  and the correct answer is not really you have to check with your  consulates talk to you  representative and they will tell you the  rules where you are at that particular time so we live in a crazy time with dr. King and mr. Mandela's dreams are coming true and black people and white people in Asians Indians and everybody's hanging out together they have interracial posses it's unbelievable what's going on  but if you have an interracial Posse if you are in an interracial pasta you have to figure out you know what are the rules of the integration possible what are the dr. Dre rules of your group that's right you know what are the rules what are the rules when a dr. Dre song comes on the radio or plays every club what is the procedure that goes into a back cuz sometimes up with my white friends and the dr. Dre song will come on and there's a lot of  in the dr. Dre song and they want to enjoy it but they can't really enjoy it around me so they start taking out the  or bumbling the  and it's just a sad sight to see it's just sad to see some white person trying to do a  less rendition of a dr. Dre song it's just  depressing and they're trying to rap along without saying  and they're like creeping down the back Street on these I got to my Glock cuz I know what the  lean into that  down a backstreet old knees I got to my block  like hey man that's not even in the song I got a little carried away right now they should put it in there really  don't worry white people get your crayon get your crayon get you a cat you're kind gay on the side so good it's okay it's got it's gotta be in the song though it's gotta be in the song it's got to be in the song so the question remains to say can white people say and that ass is to say not really oh there's some exceptions like  me harder  a lot of white women try not to laugh in front of their husbands honey I was in college I had to see what it was about he made me say it but the question remains the same can white people say  and the answers are saying not really but wait a minute there's one exception there's one exception there's one instance where white people can say  and I'm here in Johannesburg why people like this is what I paid for save me here goes listen closely because I may never say this  again the same thing okay it is Christmas Eve and it's between thirty and forty nine in the moment if you white and you on your way to Toys R Us to get your kid the last transformer down and then right before you walk in the Toys R Us some black person runs up beside you take take some money this is on you it runs away if you say somebody  matter of fact if you white and that happen to you you can say  for hope but you gotta walk around with the police or poke in your pocket chasing it black people catch you saying  the police report will act is your freedom papers hey I heard you saying  let me see your  papers Christmas Eve po 48 you just made it  yes stone you I hope they catch that  Oh having a good time up here man good time up here I'll be working I'll feel working this ain't really work though this is not really work this is my career it's not really a job this is my career you know some people have jobs some people have careers some of your audience something I got jobs some of you have careers now the people in the audience with careers need to learn to shut the  up when you around people with jobs they don't want to hear your career  keep that  to yourself okay don't let your happiness make somebody sad cuz that's what it does none but I used to work I just have a job I used to work at our Red Lobster I took a Red Lobster you know Queens Boulevard I was oh I served you good I was a I was a dishwasher it's a scrape shrimp in the garbage cans and then load up the dishwasher and that was my real job I've never got a raise I never got a promotion that kept me in the back they kept me back there because I had really  up teeth and they didn't want people to think that shrimp  up your teeth and that's what they do at restaurants they put the ugliest people in the back so if you like the people in the front you don't want to see the people in the back and that was my real job I wasn't working my way through school I was working my way in telling jokes that was my life 1989 I was scraping rip okay and people go Chris how to end up like that how the  did that happen to you minimum wage job I'll tell you exactly how to happen to me I dropped out of school in the 10th grade drop out in the 10th grade which is the dumbest thing you could ever  do you know why cuz when you drop in the 10th grade you really might as well have dropped out in the second grade what does you qualify for the exact same jobs the person that dropped out in the second grade is more qualified cuz they have eight years of work experience yeah man it's a scrape those  shrimp man it's to kill me when I tell you this right now now now I have a career I've been blessed with a career so if you got a career thank God if you got a job I hope you get a career one day that's right cuz when you got a

Chris Rock,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJmvfbDdhFg,"Racism everywhere,
everybody's pissed off. Black people yellin'
""racism."" White people yelling
""reverse racism."" Chinese people yelling
""sideways racism."" And the Indians ain't
yellin' shit 'cause they dead. So, everybody bitch about
how bad they people got it, nobody got it worse
than the American Indians, everybody needs to calm
the fuck down. Indians got it bad. Indians got it the worst. You know how bad
the Indians got it? When was the last time
you met two Indians? You ain't never met
two Indians. Shit, I have seen
a polar bear ride a fuckin' tricycle
in my lifetime, I have never seen an Indian family just
chillin' out at Red Lobster. Never seen it. (APPLAUSE) Everybody wants to save
the environment, shit I see trees
every fuckin' day, I don't never see no Indians. I went to the
Macy's Thanksgiving
Day Parade this year, they didn't even have
enough Indians at that shit. They had a bunch of Pilgrims. When it came time
for the Indians, they had three real Indians
and the rest was a bunch of Puerto Ricans
with feathers on their head. (CROWD LAUGHS AND APPLAUDS) The fuck? Shit I know Puerto Ricans
when I see 'em. You can't slip a
Puerto Rican by me. That's not Pocahontas,
that's Jennifer Lopez. (CROWD CHEERS) Racism everywhere. Who's the maddest people?
White people. Not y'all, y'all all right.
Paid money to see me, we cool. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) The feud is over. Now you watch the TV.
You watch like 60 Minutes, you see white people
pissed off, man. Mad, the white man
thinks he's losing the country. You watch the news like,
""We're losing everything. We're fuckin' losing.
Affirmative action and illegal aliens
and we're fuckin' losing
the country."" Losing? Shut the fuck up.
White people ain't losing shit. If y'all losing, who's winning? It ain't us. (CROWD CHEERS) It ain't us,
have you driven around this motherfucker? It ain't us, shit. Shit, there ain't a white man
in this room that would change places
with me. None of you. None of you would change
places with me, and I'm rich! (CROWD LAUGHS AND CHEERS) That's how good it is
to be white. There's a white one-leg
busboy in here right now that won't change places
with my black ass. He's goin', ""Nah man,
I don't wanna switch, I wanna ride
this white thing out. See where it takes me."" He's right.
'Cause when you're white, the sky's the limit. When you black,
the limit's the sky. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) That's right, man. Now, when it comes
to racism, you know who the most
racist people are, for real? The real most racist people,
old black men. You find a brother over 60,
I know some of you white people know
an old black man. You go, ""Oh, old Willie
at the job, he's so nice.""
Willie hates your guts. (CROWD LAUGHS AND CHEERS) Nothing more racist
than an old black man, you know why?
'Cause an old black man went through
some real racism. He ain't go through that
""I can't get a cab"" shit, he was the cab. White man just jump
on his back, ""Main street!"" (CROWD LAUGHING) Left, nigga! Left, nigga!
Left, you fuckin' nigga! You know what's right
about the old black man, though? Old black man,
he ain't gonna let you
fuck up his money. Whenever a old back man
sees the old white man, the old black man
always kisses the old white man's ass. Like, ""How you doin', sir?
Pleased to meet you. Whatever I can get you,
you let me know."" Soon as the white man
get out of sight he's like, ""Cracker ass, cracker.
Cracker ass, cracker, I'll put my foot
in the cracker ass. Cracker ass, cracker.
I wish that cracker would've said some shit
to me. Saltine ass motherfucker.
Cracker-- motherfucker, cracker, kiss my ass
you fuckin' cracker!"" White man come back,
""Howdy, sir!"" (CROWD LAUGHS, CHEERS)"

Mandela's dreams are coming true black people and white people in Asians Indians and everybody's hanging out together and have interracial passes it's unbelievable what's going on have a bunch of white friends and all my life friends have one  but if you have an interracial party if you are in an interracial person you have to figure out you know what are the rules of the incubator possible what other dr. dre rules of your crew that's right you know what is it dr. Dre rules what are the rules when a dr. Dre song comes on the radio or plays at a club what is the procedure that goes into effect cuz sometimes up with my white friends and the dr. Dre song will come on and there's a lot of  in the dr. Dre song and they want to enjoy it but they can't really enjoy it around me so they start taking out the  or bumbling the  and it's just a sad sight to see this is sad to see some white person trying to do a Nikolas rendition of the dr. Dre song it's just  compressing and they're trying to wrap them all without saying  and they're like creeping down the back Street on knees I got you my glock cop cuz I don't know it's a  Sam   but lean into that  he's not here down a backstreet Tony's I got some o'clock since attack like that and I never say hey man that's not even in the song I got a little carried away inside on them they should put it in there really  don't worry white people get your crayon get your crayon get your jaw and get your Kanye on the side so good it's okay it's got it's gotta be in the song it's gotta be in the song it's got to be in the song so the question remains the same can white people say now and the answer is the same not really oh there's some exceptions like  me harder  got a white woman try not to laugh or put any husband's right now I was on safari with my family up there taking pictures of animals and you're driving around and you got this guy what you called a tractor the tractor is

Stavros Halkias,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYhYnJdlPE,do you what do you do for a living uh I sell people Pokémon cards you sell people Pokemon  cards what do you that's your whole job you scour the Earth for rare cards and sell them people come to me they sell me the cards and I S to you wake up and what do you do check eBay for cars no I go to work I you go to work I do it at a store oh at

people bring them in that's awesome so some guys walk in and they're like hey um the one woman who  me divorced me and uh um to make alimony I'm going to have to sell the cards that drove us apart ultimately so who's selling cards it's divorced guys it's like uh adult children adult children yeah yeah yeah and then who buys them the same guys right the same guys just on the opposite end of luck you're constantly just shifting cards back and forth between losers then like a loser that wins a scratch off buys a Charizard or something like that interesting damn is there do you think there's a there's advancement at the at the Yu-Gi-Oh card shop or not that much not that much but it gives you time to get  swo cuz you are listen dude you I know you're you you dodg my initial questions about how big your arms are and start you threw me a very juicy tidbit about the Pokemon store and I'll give you credit that is pretty hilarious that that exists as a store that enough people in this city don't  for that to be a business like a rck and mortar are you kidding it's one thing if it was a  online store but this guy pays rent there's heating bills to go into the Pokemon card store in 2022 damn when did you I'm going to guess you start working here in like college right uh yeah how old are you I'm 29 29 okay nice all right well look man I don't know how much longer you can work at the Pokemon card store it's fine you're a youthful guy you're Jack that is funny to be like a you're like a strong nerd is that that that's the kind of guy you are here's the secret it's just fat it's not just fat bro I'm fat as well my arms don't look like that relax if I cross my arms not cuz you know why it's not fat you  cuz you got real short sleeves on  all right you know what the  you're doing so don't even  sit here and tell me you're not proud of your arms when you got them  shining for everybody to see so what is it you really don't want me to get to the heart of what's going on with you I can tell that you're very good at  deflecting but there is something in the core of you that is driving you crazy crazy and I can feel it there's one Central issue in your life and you don't want to say it in front of 375 strangers and I get that disapproving father no okay thank you it's it's the mother it's Mom all right all right I dropped out of school huh I dropped out of scho that's why oh you dropped out of school how's it going we're going into this guy's life real fast nice wow over there you couldn't have there was just such a better way to do that than whated you did it why here what the  there all right whatever uh anybody here uh bought a Pokemon card recently from a store in Toronto nice was there a jacked was there a jacked guy selling it to you it was a convention it was at a convention okay he at least gets paid you you're doing that you're doing that for fun yeah I'm a nerd you're a nerd that's all right what's your prized what's your prized piece in the collection I uh have a $300 Lego  figure you stole it okay from a child who did you steal it from a store one of my old friends your old friends oh Jesus Christ is that the reason did he this man went damn why why did you guys grow apart his Legos kept going missing did he was he a good guy why did you like what what did you why did you steal from him uh I wanted it you wanted it you must had bad parents too you don't even know basic morality is this your dad for real come on man what the  was he a bad kid yeah he had some issues he had some issues that's awesome you're like buddy listen the Deadpool figure the least of our problems I like the Mario version of the other ladies Wario you know yeah big we a warrior big Warrior fan back here oh Mario okay nice there you go congrats guys that's awesome what do we got Mario Luigi and Princess Peach okay nice no uh no who's who's the other princess just da no Daisy huh huh Luigi's the third that's so sad dude that's one of the worst third wheel it's so clear who's not getting  cuz it's Luigi there's no Mystique as to oh you know maybe no that's like you know if you were all like  bumblebees or no one would know who but it's like no I'm I'm very clear I'm letting you know I'm the one who doesn't  uh one time at a Halloween party I saw Luigi by himself and that was one of the most  up things I've ever seen in my life that's how low your self-esteem is you dress is the secondary guy  solo damn dude  going all right Luigi what's going on bro is Life okay no things are bad do you hang out with this couple too much are you like are you always yeah yeah yeah you got to break free of that dude you know what I mean forever the Third Wheel okay how long you guys been friends Mario and Luigi 10 years okay and how long have you guys been dating like three three years okay so this is a you guys are really in this Dynamic big time right now this is something that happens over and over again what do you guys have you guys ever had another group Halloween costume have you ever done like The Simpsons and your Flanders or something like  that huh anything like that no first one okay first one probably last one you'll do like this that's good man have you have you been in any relationships in this uh since they've been dating have you has it been any double dates or just third Wheeling no not a single one in three years God damn Peach what's going on we don't have a  friend with low self-esteem we can throw this guy's  way you're kind of  the money up a little bit he's committed he's clearly a good friend he's ridiculing himself dress dressing up in your which was clearly your idea there's no way these two thought of this you're using him as a prop for your costume he's essentially a walking prop I I'm if I bet you if you could find a Yoshi costume to cover his face you would have but you were like this will do this is good enough no friends what the  no friends for Luigi right right right but you see how maybe you know it's good it was coming from the right place but you know I just kind of did break down the flaw on that thinking for the last 5 minutes if you don't want him left out I'm saying do you have any friends he can  you know what I mean that's if you really want to be a good pal not matching costume costumes aren't exactly what would help him out I think letting this man get sucked off and dressing in a regular T-shirt and jeans would probably be a lot better for him W just a button down and some head gotten recently was so much better than a costume but anyway enjoy the rest of the show guys I'm sorry to  break I'm I'm I'm on your team pal don't worry I'm not I know it came off as ridiculing you and I was to some extent but I am at least rooting for you you know what were you up

happened let you guys know about my back story uh I am the product of a single parent I don't think you're supposed to woo at that I don't think that's a woolable thing hey my husband left me I was just saying whenever it's set in a  tone like that it always means single mom always because no one complains about being raised by a single dad you can't it looks so much fun Playboy's all over the house you get to eat waffles for dinner watch rated R movies on a school night you're basically just like a mini wingman the whole time your dad takes you out of happy hour he's like hey do something cute so pops can get some strange  good idea old man good idea I was raised by a single mom which basically made me pajamas I took a lot of dick away from that lady in the 80s and I feel that grossest sentence I've ever said in my life  it's a heartfelt apology I mean it I know what dating was it was five when my mom started dating some guy would come over but cool A New Roommate don't touch my by the time I was seven I was like a grizzled vet I was the one answering the door smoking a Winston just all confident like what's up chief you're here for the old lady right on quick Secret you buy me a ninja turtle toy I'll go get lost in that garage for an hour get you some alone time she loves red wine she still does it's a delicious drink being raised by a single mom had to deal with babysitters a lot uh which was fun for the most part except once my mom let this teenager in my neighborhood named Darren watch me oh don't worry he didn't it's not one of those it's not one of those stories I wouldn't do that to you guys it's a nice night out I'm not trying to take it all one-man showy foreign that's where I lost feelings at eight years old watch Stephen King's It yeah he brain raped me that's why you can't you can't let an eight-year-old with an active imagination watch a Stephen King movie I just thought it was real I just thought that happened to people I was like oh apparently there's a clown that can turn into a spider all right I'm gonna have to look after that for the rest of my life that movie terrified me to the point that I would not leave my bedroom at night for three months what I'm trying to tell you half drunk studio audience years old I pee to my own Petra like some sort of war criminal just pulled my Dick Tracy pajamas down I was like the bad man's in the hall I'm not embarrassed by that I'm not I'm more ashamed of the fact that I thought I was going to get away with it because I did it in the spring forgot I think most of you know where this is going they got chilly in the house my mom turned on the heat and my room smelled like a bus stop in the middle of July stank like hot piss constantly even the point my mom was like what the  is that smell you're a homeless man living in your closet no Mom you wanna know what that smell is the smell of fear and irresponsible parenting do some background checks I'm 29 now for the sake of the joke I just actually am 29 at this this moment which sucks 29 sucks no one tells you what's gonna suck like people in their 30s and 40s complain they should because their lives are almost over she said go ahead and die I need walking room uh no you shouldn't you should applaud that's everyone in their 20s like you eat a dick his 29 is the end of fun without being judged for it at 29 you and your fun friends stop partying and start having addictions that's what I call it can't get drunk on a Monday without raising some eyebrows it's just weird to me that things that in my early 20s that used to make me cool now make people nervous I used to get drunk before class in college and I was like this guy is awesome hammered before intro to Roman lit 8 A.M class now if I get drunk before work everyone's like hey you cool you need to talk no I'm still awesome no no you're not you're almost homeless this is sure I think drinking gets I know drinking is if you do it too much it is a bad thing but it also at the same time is a good thing I think you understand life better if you get shit-faced all the time everyone that clapped will be in a program  finding God getting chips  I'm just saying I understand a lot of things better because I'm a hard drinker like homelessness I get it I get it now when I was a kid and I saw homeless people I was just like why are you outside but now that I've been a bit of 12 Years every time I see a homeless person I'm just like oh man you were probably so much fun 10 years ago here's a quarter for your Kickstarter is it mean no kind of and I'm single at 29 which sucks I know what really guy that's the voice of the saddest man in the world she's like someone brought it up someone else like I know why I'm single because I always dress like I'm in a Pearl Jam cover band what's up everybody thank you for coming out we are Jeremy just sucks being it sucks being single at 29 because it's like you know which way do I go do I go older or younger right like I know 18 to 22 I know that's done I can't fight in that weight class anymore  I just I can't compete 18 to 22 year old girls live different lives they get things for being young and hot they're like I want to be on a bike that they're on a boat like that just happened manifest What's France like and they lived there for three months rent paid it's frustrating I think I'm in a different stage in my life I think right now I'd rather just try to bang a 47 year old mother of three they could tell me what Zeppelin's like live like that's what I want stories history  I like you could talk to older women you can have deep conversations with older women you can't talk to young girls they changed language they started abbreviating all of their words it's a real thing now I heard a girl once go oh that's delish where is the rest of that word you know how confusing that is to be at a bar having a decent conversation with a girl that she randomly turns to her friend and she's like I just got back from vacay it was Toad's Ab Fab what  did you have a brain injury why are you talking like that if that girl keeps that up 20 years from now all of her conversation is gonna be like Soho and by the way that is just me doing Jabba the Hutt in a bimbo voice  that's all that is I'm just saying like older women are easy to approach they're better to hang out with they have no ego that's the best thing older women are like hey what's up Junior hey how are you wanna yeah younger women have too much eco because they get hit all the time by douchebags so they have to build up that ego it's like a deterrent system like I've seen I've seen it like young women walking around bars bragging about negative personality aspects just walking around like look at that for me I'm a I'm such a and every guy's like yeah of course you are you're young and hot are you thirsty probably get thirsty being a it's a luxury older women don't have you can't beat 44 and frumpy walking around like I'm such a no lady you're alone that's you all that's why you're getting hammered in a bowling alley that's why I'm hitting on you Zell I live in Queens New York all right let's calm down it's affordable six weeks ago I spotted a hipster if you don't know about hipsters what they are is they're the human version of bed bugs  if you see one there's probably 40 more under your bed judging your music a lot of people hate hipsters I don't I respect them because they move into the most dangerous neighborhoods and force everybody out some gangster it's actually just white people being white people that's all it is we've been doing it for centuries they're even starting to look like old Spanish conquistadors with their dumb mustaches  next thing you know they're gonna start wearing those metal helmets carrying swords I'm the Duke of the housing projects gluten-free cupcakes forever and I bring me the first Strokes album on vinyl I just don't want them messing up my neighborhood I love my neighborhood I have my favorite barbecue restaurant I go there all the time I'm afraid hipsters are going to move in and change that I'm afraid one day I'm gonna go and try to get some barbecue and behind the counter is going to be some kitten skinny jeans Buddy Holly glasses wearing a scarf even though it's August it's going to take one look at me and he's gonna be like ah we don't serve barbecue here anymore all we serve is kale kale cakes kale shakes and our waiters are cats and we just put trays on their backs so if you want to order put some catnip down you're in Mr nibbles's section welcome to kittens and kale just don't like pretentious people if you have a cause good for you but don't be pretentious about it I read a news article recently about a group of animal rights activists that went and protested a makeup factory because they said that this Factory was testing makeup on animals which is hilarious are you serious someone gets paid to put lipstick on a chimp sign me up right now I'll quit comedy I work 100 hours a week you let me smoke weed at lunch I won't even join a union  chuckle and collect my check oh test Factory workers and on top of that they have to explain their job to their friends having a beer after work everyone's like Doug what's wrong tough day we tried the new midnight Plum mascara on a chicken I don't think she liked the way she looked it's gonna be a long week of Revlon everyone's got causes everyone's I don't know man maybe I am just a hunk of I personally believe that like I feel guilty because I feel like we're ruining everything like if you're under 30 you and I are slowly ruining everything you should that's that's the part of the problem We Are the World we ruined the tattoo we ruined it if you're a white guy under 25 and you're covered in tattoos probably not afraid of you can you have tattoos terrified of you if I see an old man with a faded anchor on his forearm that that man's watch death tell me I'm supposed to be afraid of some 19 year old arm covered in seaweed tattoos taking an hour to explain what's on his body well life's a journey and that's why I have a koi fish because it symbolizes peace shut up Caleb no one cares you're a barista not a member of the Yakuza been waiting a half hour for this coffee that might have happened too I'm just saying threatening elements of tattoos like when I see old people with tattoos I immediately think of threatening things like oh this old man has been to war or prison I see a young person with tattoos I'm like I don't know you're probably a vegan maybe a freelance blogger you're definitely in a failed band that I don't know for sure this is weird I feel like we feel we're so important and yet we turn around and treat older Generations in this country awful we do we blatantly disrespect our elders because they can't keep up with our technology we have all this brand new technology in the last 10 years they don't know how to use it so we talk right to their face  I was born during the Great Depression I remember when straws were invented my nana can't turn on an iPad Nana how can you not turn on an iPad Hey kid are you still the guy that killed Nazis pretty sure my vagina Changed History everything's getting shittier kids their musical tastes I just want to hear a bunch of beeps and boops now I like music because music makes me think about my life it makes me reflect it's always been that way first song that ever made me do that was Michael Jackson's Man in the Mirror ah sure it's an unbelievable song problem is the first time I heard that song I was five years old it's a weird age to be reflective sitting in the backyard watching the sun go down like ah get your together kid you're a half a decade old can't go to sleep without a nightlight you don't even know your own address foreign walks in the backyard she's like Dan what are you doing what am I doing what are we doing Trish you're renting why don't you pull your  together I'll be in the sandbox thinking of options you guys very much you guys are unbelievable  all right

like how hot people hot people get to be pretty dumb cuz they're so hot hot people get to say dumb  and we're just like yeah right you know what I'm talking about they like do you want to go dance in the rain and you're like God you're a free spirit if an Ugo said that you'd be like shut up you wet dog no it's pouring outside hot snow hot snow they get to say some stupid  cuz they know if you disagree with them all they have to do is touch you you ever been touched by a hot you'll Buckle immediately you go actually I I don't think that's right you should look that up and they go no it is and you're like I want to write you a poem I'll kill for you about 10 12 years ago I dated a woman very Whimsical she was very Whimsical and I I never I never disagreed with her and one time we were leaving a diner in Queens and we were going back to my apartment and we had to go over an overpass over the highway and we got to the top of the stairs of the overpass and she looked back at me and she said don't you ever feel like running and then took off I've never felt like running and she did the whole like across the overpass down the other side gone couldn't find her terrifying she was gone I could not legitimately could not find her for 5 to 10 minutes one of the most terrified I've ever been in my life cuz I was like she's dead and there is zero chance the NYPD is believing my story showing up being like let me get this straight you got to the top of the stairs and this woman said don't you feel like running yeah we got him I didn't  kill him but I was jealous cuz she would always like you know she was comfortable naked that's got to be cool that's got to be so cool hot people man they get to just  enjoy it they just get to have sex come and then be like where do you want to eat babe I've never had sex without at least once being like what is this who are you right now this isn't you you're a silly goose and I'm sitting there being like yeah  yeah do you ever make

it's not bad it's actually fun well not all it's harder to poop but I'm less horny and it's kind of nice it's finally quiet since puberty I've been dragged behind my dick like it was a runaway horse yeah see big titties and you're like and now things are more settled you know but I like it I think that's why men are all messed up in our and our 20s is cuz we go from being little boys to creeps overnight you know one day you're just like a little boy that just wants to talk about dinosaurs to anyone that'll listen you know you're just cornering your parents' friends like did you know the stegosaurus was from the late Jurassic Period and was a  herbivore and you wake up the next day you're like I want  all I want is  and now I'm 40 and I'm back to loving dinos and uh it's great lot of good work being done in the paleontology world now I still like sex but if we're being honest at the age of 40 you know what I like more than good sex good sleep if my fiance was like do you want to sleep for 9 hours uninterrupted I'd be like oo you   get over here I'm going to hold  you a  what is this 09 I'm trying to stuff a pillow in between my knees that's how you get sexx noises out of me at 40 put that pillow there I'm like oh  oh  oh my hips are lined up oh it's just it's easier to navigate when you're less horny life is just easier you know Instagram way easier I still look at butt models pictures but now it's just to read the comments it's my favorite thing on social media comments on sexy photos see some big oiled up butt outside of Miami 413 comments you're like let's rock and roll cuz immediately it's just dude's being like Mia Bella hard eye emojis or you see the guy it's like I hope you had a great day today you're like e that's the hardiest  I've ever read in my life did you type that with your boner you weirdo oh hope you had a great day I bet go come and then come back with that same energy I like Instagram cuz it'll tell on your friends for being hor Instagram will be like look at this fat ass 35,000 people liked it and Jeff  Jeffrey cuz that's what happens when you when you get too horny you get in trouble that's just as a man if it breaches the horny level you're going to do something stupid I almost lost my fiance during covid not even to the virus to a Bluetooth speaker yeah if you've been in the situation you know where this is going I I bought it I brought the vampire into the house I bought I bought her a waterproof Bluetooth speaker so we could enjoy music in the shower that was it we both loved it used it had a great time Co hits we're locked together for seven weeks by around week five you know she's taken a pretty long shower and I was in the living room and I was like I could probably watch some adult entertainment on my phone what could go wrong I can't imagine how jarring porn is out of context 100% out of context that's got to be wild she's washing her hair singing along to siza and then instantly it's like it's got to be a lot and I have no idea how that feels I do know how it feels to watch porn and not know where the volume is that's the one I know where you're like the  this lady looks like she's screaming her head off just mushing on that up button you know like give me something give me anything then through the wall you hear just like  me you're like no ah even telling you guys that's making my pee hole snap shut oh my God I heard it and immediately I was like run run but I couldn't you know cuz there was a virus in the sky killing  at that I was like just tell her the truth tell her the goddamn truth and I went and stood outside that bathroom door I was like you're going to tell her the truth then that door opened and I was like hey I opened an email and I Verbatim what I said she told me when it happened she tried to manually turn it down on the speaker but because I was hitting up it just looked like I was bullying her with porn you know like you're going to  listen to this  well she stayed thank God thank God we are getting married I don't like calling her my fiance I think that's too fancy of a word I like calling her my wife elect let you know you know I'm like you got the votes but you hav't been sworn in I would no policy changes quite yet one of my best friends just got married you know all my friends are married and got kids now but my best friend just got married in Guatemala and invited me to really test the Friendship that's sorry but you're two whites from Colorado and you're going to make me go to Guatemala I was worried we're going to have to do those photos that white people people love to do where all the groomsmen have to subtly act like we want to  the bride in all the photos you know which one I'm talking about where like she has her leg across four of us and we're all holding a piece with our sunglasses down like were we about to gang bang this  or a photo where like she shows us the wedding ring like I'm not a  anymore and we're like what  but there's none of that instead they did a drone photo that was the big one and that was like the thing they were they're like all right guys the wedding DJ was like time for the Drone photo going to jump in point I was like no like count of three jumping point I watched all my friends be like I don't want to do this and then that countdown hit and was like three two one corniest  I've ever done in my life life and easily the most privileged thing I've ever done cuz usually in a third world country when a drone shows up at a wedding lot less jumping in point and lot more running and screaming that's fun it's a fun joke n they're happily married that was a good wedding to go to I'm a child of divorce if you're from a divorced family that sounds about right usually when you're under 10 and your parents get divorce they tell you it's not your fault they love to say that it's not your fault but that's the please drink responsibly of divorce you know what I mean you know when beer companies are like drink all night please drink responsibly in case you  kill anybody that's why parents do it in case you grow up to be a psycho and then they're like I said it wasn't his  fault my parents hated each other hated each other no internet went all through me my mom lived in Denver my dad lived in San Francisco and I would travel between the two cities like a little shitalking messenger show up in the Bay Area with a scroll I bring news from the Rockies Patricia says you're a drunk a loser a  li go home two weeks later I told him mother he says good luck getting child support I mean you got to respect the guy never paid a dime got to respect the stat line it's true never paid her child support and in the United States in 1997 the United States enacted the dead beat dad law which meant if you didn't pay child support you were going to jail my dad died in 1997 buzzer  beater he Indiana Jones D dude he slid out and grabbed his hat he's like good luck with that bigheaded weirdo my Mom hated my dad my Mom hated my dad so much she dated my dad's ex bestest friend also my godfather yeah yeah it was a little bit of alcoholic Hamlet going on they used to get shitfaced at dinner and just talk  about my dad they get blackout and be like he's a  loser and after a while you know you're like well he's my dad start being like well he's pretty good at catch they're like how do you know you're like damn it damn it damn it I hated my mom's boyfriend man he was so mean he'd get drunk he'd call me stupid cuz I would speak incorrectly he be like you're a  idiot you're going to grow up to pump gas that's what you always say you're going to pump gas you're like Yeah Joe like two states do that learn your insults who's the idiot and I couldn't here's the thing he never hit me he never  me me sorry made love I didn't have a case on him verbal abuse wasn't a thing in the 90s I couldn't go to my guidance counselor at school and be like I have a problem at home with my mom's boyfriend they be like what's going on does he touch you does he hit you you're like I just kind of owns my ass at dinner every night just like a mean roast every night now he did something worse than hitting me or touching me he joined a 50 and over swim league Masters that means Speedos these are men over 50 swimming competitively so every Saturday morning in the winter they'd wake me up out of my warm bed and I'd have to go sit in an indoor pool fully clothed I hope none of you know that hell the smell of chlorine and you're just sweating in your pullover starter jacket then you got to watch a guy that hates your dad and is currently  your mom you got to watch him just cut through the water like a dolphin to this day best swimmer I've ever seen with my own eyes it was insane first time I watched him swim it took my breath away first time I watched him swim I was like well I won't be fighting him in the water I got to take this guy out on the land or in the air do you know how bad it hurts to have someone talk  to you and then put on swim goggles he's like hey your dad's a  loser and that pool's wetter than your mom all right I hate you Joe I hope you're drowned I'm such a people pleaser I got I tried to get him to like me my whole life and I hated him that's what sucks if you're a people pleaser it's one of the worst things because you often times try to get people to like you that you don't even like and it sticks with you your whole life I think every American is afraid of being in a mass shooting I'm specifically afraid of being the guy that accidentally lets the shooter into the building all it would take is a guy going hey door's locked that's it I'd be like oh I got you yeah five minutes later it's like I'm like I'm sorry I thought he worked here as is I just do dumb  I try to do good stuff and I do it's just it always goes wrong I try donating money for a while that's stupid donate first off donating money is the most American way to help just giving money and being like you do it I'm wai for an Amazon package but one time I read this news article about this guy that got locked up in Riker's Island for a nonviolent crime and he ended up dying in there because he didn't have bail money and I read that and I was like that is so  up I should help so I started donating to this place called The Bronx Freedom fund and I gave them money to help non-violent criminals get out of jail and I felt so good I was slapping my own back I was like I'm so good then an article came out that the Bronx Freedom fund released a nonviolent offender turns out pedophile went to Queens got a kid my bad month later another article came out that the Bronx Freedom fund LED out another nonviolent criminal he was schizophrenic and beat four homeless people to death in their sleep I read that I was like am I funding crime in New York City I'm just the worst Batman villain of all time it is I Batman the donator I have been releasing pedophiles and murderers this is how dumb I am I wrote him an email I go can I get a refund like that's not how this works I don't know man it's that's that's one of the things that makes me feel older is I get nervous about technology where I was never nervous about it you know I get like scared by technology because we were the first you know if you're near 40 near the age of 40 we were the first generation to have the internet we were the remember how mean we were to our parents remember that they'd be like I sent an electronic mail you like it's email you dumb  don't pick up the phone when I'm on the computer and then now there's  coming out that scares me I was like oh what it's AI I was like so the pope wasn't wearing a puffy white  jacket took me a week to learn that wasn't real of course it's crazy I don't have tick talk on my phone I don't have it my fiance has it on her phone and she shows it to me like I'm her  Grandpa she really does she shows me Tik toks and I'm like oh and those dogs are friends oh I like this one Tik tok's wild dude it's if you go on there you see some crazy  there's a whole trend on Tik Tok I'm making n of this up there's a whole trend on Tik Tok right now where people are self diagnosing themselves autistic no doctor not one Medical Professional consultant it's just them to camera write down Barrel they have motivational music playing and then they put text above their heads that they point to in like a real smug shitty way it's all regular  they're like I used to be afraid of large crowds I thought I was socially awkward turns out I've been masking my autism for 27 years I'm autistic what if what if we only use the word  for those people that's it that's it never for anyone with a disability or anyone with a special need just anytime someone is like yeah I'm self-diagnosed autistic you can be like oh you're   and they'll be like yeah cuz they're full of  it's crazy they do that because that's the one good thing about the internet is you can prove people wrong instantly you ever done that you ever Googled something in front of your friends and be like look how good is that feeling oh it's the closest gotten to slam dunking just be like that and shutting an elevator door on someone that is such a good feeling you shut that door you're  like I got into an argument with a younger comic he's in his mid 20s and I was telling him about the music that came out after 9911 I don't know if you were old enough to live through 9/11 and you didn't forget oo let me catch you forgetting but the music that came out was Bonkers for 6 months after 9/11 all that came out was just like hyper aggressive country music which makes sense they were getting us Ready for War but every song that came out was like step on up and we'll kick your ass and we were all like Toby Keith was just printing money he made so much money he opened a shitty restaurant chain but radio stations back when they actually were powerful radio stations did this thing where they took I don't know if anybody remembers this they took Enrique glacius is song Hero and then spliced news footage from 9/11 clap if you remember that see I'm not making this up what a lot of people don't know is that Enrique glacius wrote the song Hero trying to  Anna cornova so it's a sex song that they put 911 audio once you know he wrote it for that reason go back and listen to that you can tell how horny he is in the song when he's like let me be your hero baby it's just him being like please touch it  please please touch my penis and then randomly it's like the second tower is Fallen it's  wild and I found it on YouTube because of this disagreement I found it on YouTube it's crazier than you remember go look it up I'll give you a time marker 53 seconds into the video it's a clear sexual lyric Enrique glacius goes would you tremble if I touched your lips and then you hear a woman go I got thrown through a window and you're like what the  what the  is that and we put that out like that's for the first respondents I don't know man it's just the older I get I just keep being like I'm losing touch and I'm still want people to like me it's insane we just moved from uh New Jersey back into New York City and we were living in Jersey and we had all these like 10 and 11y old kids in our neighborhood these Little River Rats just riding their bikes around and cussing I wanted them to like me so bad so  bad then they caught me talking to my dog and that's that's a wrap you don't come back from that I don't talk to my dog in a regular voice

when they don't know the word cuz IID hear him cussing sometimes I'm like you don't know what that word means that's like one of the best parts of growing up just finding out what cuss words mean just ripping one and being like no okay that's bad when I was 8 years old I walked in the kitchen my mom and my older cousin were having a conversation and my cousin goes yeah it's not like I got a  from her and my mom goes don't say that in front of the kid 8-year-old me immediately was like that's my new catchphrase I had no idea it was sexual I legitimately thought it was a real job I was like if Andy saying it this has got to be cool so immediately I'm like well I'm going to go down the street and tell my friend Eric he's got to hear about this so I rode my bike to Eric's house what I didn't know was that his sister was having her 10th birthday party yeah it's going right where you think it's going there was a 10-year-old birthday party in the backyard parents kids everybody and I came around the corner and just screamed out what are you giving out  like a tiny little swinger this this a key party I thought it was going to kill I thought everyone was going to be like who's the big kid instead I just felt Eric's dad violently grabbed me by my upper arm you ever get picked up when you're a kid you're like okay you know your feet start T you're like yep I liked Eric's dad too he was like you know he was a good dad and good dads are always nice to kids without dads they always love that that's why they're always assistant coaches good Dads love to take a kid without a dad and be like keep trying young man but in your mind you're like  off die that was the first time I ever saw him mad and he was legit mad he sat me down in the kitchen and he's like where did you hear that word and I just matched his energy I was like I'll never  tell you you saw him be like oh all right kids from a volatile household and then he just tried to First 48 me 20 minutes he just kept being like you know you tell me you can go go outside you go back to the party one point he put a soda down he's like you like orange crush he kept saying he's like who said that where did you hear that

Matt McCusker,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAjQyOW-Ak,"- Don't get weird.
I know it's weird right now, but I'm not fuckin' dead. I'm here.
I'm telling the story. All right? You can
unclench your buttholes. This isn't--
This isn't ghost comedy.   How you doing, ladies? Can I interest you in a... threesome?  Welcome to
 ""This Is Not Happening."" I'm your host, Roy Wood Jr.  Huh. 'Sup, Little Roy? - I did it again.    - Hello, Roy. How's the water? Does it feel...pure?   Can you feel me inside of you?  ♪ ♪   You can hear his radio show
""The Bonfire"" on Comedy Central Radio. This is Dan Soder.    - I live in New York City. I've been there for ten years. Originally, I'm from Denver,
Colorado. - Yay.
- I grew up in Aurora. - Yeah? People stop cheering after you
say that.  But for five years, I lived
in Tucson, Arizona, which, uh--there's a reason
there's one applause to that. That's a real niche group. There are good people
in Tucson, but I found most of them to be
angry, sunburnt white people. Just walking around like,
""All these Mexicans..."" You're like,
""Yeah, it used to be Mexico.""  They're...  I hate to break it to you, but
they're supposed to be here. You're not. That's why you're burnt all the
time. Just go back to the Great Lakes
and eat curdled cheeses.  It's what us pinks do best.  but I also lived with a drug
dealer, which I can't recommend enough
if you do drugs.  If you do drugs, live with a
drug dealer. It's like living at Costco. It's just free samples every
day. And then Costco gets robbed,
and you're like, You know what? I don't think I
should live at Costco anymore."" Yeah, that was a bad idea. I need to really get my life
together at this point. But when I moved to Tucson, my first and best friend
that I made there was a guy named Amir, who was an Israeli kid
from Long Island. - Whoo!
- And--yeah. I don't know if that's for
Israeli or Long Island, but we'll keep it moving
forward. Those are two--yeah. But Amir was the first real
person I met from Long Island, and he was very Long Island. He was very like,
""Yeah, bro."" Like, everything-- That just existed
as a sentence filler. Like, ""Yeah, bro."" He would do these things that certain people
on Long Island do that they're
question statements. So he says a statement but
it's framed like a question. So he'd come in
the living room and be like, ""Yo, these Nikes
are ill, right?"" Yes. I don't know if that's
the desired response. Amir was very good
at selling weed. He was very good at it. It was a natural habit that
he just picked up and ran with. Freshman year, it started
at, you know, 20 bags and then eighths. And then sophomore year,
it was like quarters and half ounces. Then I moved in with him, and it went to, like, ounces
to quarter pounds. You know,
then our lease ran out, but the furniture
was getting good, so I, you know, re-leased. I was like, ""Yeah, let's
keep going with this."" He started to getting, like,
pounds, and, then, you know, he got a fish tank. Hey, drug dealers, stop with
the fish tanks. It's hackneyed now. It's also stupid. You're gonna have a flood. Care about your other
possessions, please. - I'm sorry. I'm really hyped up about this,
as you can tell. But I didn't have
to sell drugs. I just--I just smoked his weed
and looked at his fish tank. So it was a pretty good
fuckin' deal. One day I'm going
to do laundry. I'm a broke college student. I have six loads of laundry
in six plastic bags, like I'm fuckin' moving out of
a girlfriend's house who has a drug problem. It's like, ""I'm serious, Donna. I am gone now."" But I fill up my car, and I
go--I go to the bank, and I turn $10 into $10 in
quarters. At the time,
I'm wearing cargo shorts, a liquor T-shirt and a swimsuit as underwear, 'cause it was laundry day. I'm not--I'm not that giant
of a piece of shit where I'm just like, ""I can
take a shower with it on. It washes it.
It's pretty much--you know.""  ""It just takes care
of itself."" So I go and I change $10
into $5 in quarters, which I put on my right leg, and $5 in quarters
that I put on my left leg. So when I walk around, it
makes a noise like ""shh, shh."" I sound like the shittiest
sheriff in the west. It's like, ""Oh, hello--"" Like, it's just awful.
It was awful. So I have my pockets
of change. I get to my car,
and Amir calls me, and he's like,
""Yo, we're getting robbed?"" And I'm like, ""I don't--"" Is that a question
or a statement? You gotta tell me right now,
'cause this is very dangerous. But he's like,
""Yeah, I was gonna do a deal, ""and these guys came by,
and, you know, ""I think they're trying
to rob me. So, you know,
I called off the deal."" And I'm like, ""All right."" He's like, ""Will you drive
around the neighborhood and see if they're there
or not?"" ""Sure, whatever."" I'm driving a 1996 Dodge
Stratus. It's a real hunk of shit. So I probably just look like
feds to them, but I... I do a lap,
I don't see anybody. So I pull into our carport
that's under our apartment, and standing there
when I get out of the car, the first guy's, like,
this 6'4"" piece of white trash. Like--you gotta understand
something about me. When I was a little kid,
my dad moved to this town in Northern California
that grows, like, the biggest pieces
of white trash. So at 33,
I like to fancy myself a little bit of
a white trash sommelier. And this guy was mwah! Just--just a top shelf
piece of shit. He was covered in tattoos
that I can only describe as Mountain Dew tattoos. The same way an adult
would, like, drink a whole can
of Mountain Dew and be like,
""Put fireballs on my elbows!"" And you're like, ""That--I don't
know. That doesn't sound right, but
sure."" And standing with him is this
5'4"" South Side Tucson cholo blood-in, blood-out like,
""What's up, white boy?"" Like that, like, ""Oh, hi.""  ""Hi. No habla."" They're standing there, and I
get out, and the little cholo's like, ""Hey, man, Tommy Green live
here?"" I'm like, ""That's a terrible
fake name, and no.""  If you're gonna rob a drug
dealer, change up the fuckin'--
you know what I mean? Like, if he was robbing a coke
dealer, he's like, ""Hey, Mark Blow here?"" Like, clearly a synonym of what
you're trying to get from... But I'm like, ""No, no one's
here,"" so he--they leave. They--both of them walk off. I go upstairs, and Amir's
there, and he's like, ""Yo, did you see
anybody?"" And I tell him; I'm like,
""Yeah, he's a big piece of white
trash, little fuckin' blood-in,
blood-out."" And he's like, ""Yeah."" He's like, ""Yeah, y'all, those
are the guys."" And I'm like, ""Oh, shit, well,
they're gone. They left."" We look out.
We don't see them. So, you know, we do what drug
dealers and their roommates do, and we smoke weed and play
PlayStation for two hours. I'm about to smoke a cigarette,
and I grab the barbecue lighter that I use to smoke
cigarettes, 'cause I'm a little bit of
garbage myself...  And...Amir--Amir gets a call,
and he's like, ""Yo, the deal's back on. ""They want to do the deal
for five pounds, ""but they're gonna do it--
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna walk to the street
and then get in a car."" And I'm like, ""Okay."" And he's like, ""Yo, will you
walk me to the car?"" I'm very high, and...  On weed and victories of
""Madden.""  And if Amir watches this, he
knows I'm telling the truth. I ran that shit. But he's like, ""Yo, will you
walk me to the car? You're gonna smoke a
cigarette."" And I'm like,
""Eh, all right."" And then as I go
to the door he goes, ""Yo, get the gun."" Now if you've lived in Arizona, you know how insanely easy it
is to get a handgun. It's like buying socks. You just walk in
and you're like, ""Gun."" And they're like,
""Here's your gun."" And you're like,
""This is pretty dangerous."" But I was with Amir,
and we went to a gun show, and I'm not joking
the first thing he said to the first gun dealer
he met was, ""Yo, what's your
cheapest gun?"" And you're like,
that's not what I want to hear as the person
that lives next to you and knows you're buying this
for self-defense. What he did is he did buy
the cheapest gun possible. It had a metal slide
but a plastic handle. He bought a plastic gun,
and by the way, we took it to the range. It never shot straight. The bullet always bent like
some trick shot in an action movie. We were like, ""Ahh."" So Amir's like, ""Yo, I'll get
the gun."" And I tell him, I'm like, ""I'm not fuckin'
using that thing."" And he goes--and then with
this, like, aggressive Long Island energy he's like,
""Yo, you dick."" Like, he was mad at me--
he was mad at me for questioning why
I didn't want to bring a gun to a drug deal,
and he's like, ""Yo, you dumbass,
what'll happen is ""if they got a knife
and you show 'em the gun, then they're gonna be scared
and they're gonna leave."" And for some reason I believed
that rock-paper-scissors fuckin' shit, like-- I was like, oh, yeah,
that sounds correct. So I put the gun
in my cargo shorts. I grabbed a Camel Light and the
barbecue lighter. Amir has an athletic bag full
of 5 pounds. He walks out in front of me. Now, I have $10 in quarters on
me. You can hear me coming from a
mile away. When I walk, I sound like a
knight in shitty chain mail. It's like, ""Shh, shh, shh.""  So we start walking
down the stairs. Right when we get
to the bottom of the stairs, fuckin' Mountain Dew tattoos
comes around, gun drawn, gets to Amir. fuckin' the tiny vato
comes right up the stairs, gun on my chest. Like, perfectly
right on my chest. Don't get weird.
I know it's weird right now, but I'm not fuckin' dead. I'm here.
I'm telling the story. All right? You can
unclench your buttholes. This isn't--
This isn't ghost comedy. Roy didn't come up here
in that loud-ass jacket like, ""Do you wanna see
the other side?""   So I got a .45 pointed right
in the middle of my chest. And I'm a child of the '80s. I grew up with Schwarzenegger
movies and Stallone movies. And always in those
action movies when a bad guy pulls out a gun on the hero,
they always say some cool shit. Like, ""You better use that."" Uh, turns out I don't. I get very polite
if you put a gun on me. I'm like, ""Hi, how are you?"" I get, like,
customer service voice. ""Hi! Has everything
been okay? Would you mind filling out
a brief survey?""  And as I do that
and I lift my hands up, I've already blown the rules
apparently of a robbery, 'cause this guy's furious
that my hands are up. He's like, ""Put your fuckin'
hand down. Put your fuck--"" And I'm like, ""All right,
shit, I'm sorry."" And he grabs--
when I did that, I lifted my shirt high enough that he saw the handle
of the gun. So he takes the gun
off of my waistband and he's like,
""Go back inside."" And it's like, ""Ahhh."" And I'm standing on this second
floor of this apartment looking out over my stairwell
like, ""Can I fly?""  I didn't really know my dad
that well. He could be part flying
squirrel. That would have been great if I
took off and just drifted away. He's like, ""Fuckin' white boys
are flying now."" You'd glide away. But he's like ""Turn around.
Go back inside."" I'm like, ""Fuck, all right."" And I turn around,
and as I do, he takes my gun-- the gun that he took off me-- and fuckin' hits me
in the back of the head. Now, I'm very lucky to have
a minor role on the Showtime show
""Billions."" But the best piece of acting
I've ever done in my life is getting hit in the head
by a 5'3"" dude holding a plastic gun and acting like
that shit hurt. He hit me, I was like,
""Ahhh-ahh-ahhh! Oh, you're so strong!"" ""You swing it
like a Norwegian god swings a hammer."" So I go to the ground, and immediately right
when I go to the ground, you know,
he puts me--he zip-ties. He pulls out zip ties. He zip-ties my arms
behind my back. He duct-tapes
my legs together, and then he pulls out
an Army duffle bag and just starts
ransacking our apartment. If I could Yelp a robbery...  Five stars. Uh, guy brought
his own material. He was prompt.
He was direct. He had clearly
done this before. It was the mark of a true
professional. He starts robbing
and he goes around our house, he grabs everything, and
then he starts taking his .45 and coming over to my head
and he starts going, ""Where's the money,
white boy?"" -   - That is the creepiest laugh
to have at that point... That sinister-ass laugh from
behind me First off, from telling the
story, you know I don't trust anyone
behind me, like a... like an old mafia boss. I don't like anyone sitting
behind me. Then to hear him going,
""Ha-ha-ha-ha. ""Of course you were scared. You filled your life fleeing
from you.""  He takes the .45, and he keeps
going up to me, and he keeps, like, pushing it
on my temple going, ""Where's
the money, white boy?"" ""Where's the money, white boy?"" Now, I'm fine being called
white boy. I've been called white boy my
whole life. The only time it stings is when
I know for a fact I'm a foot taller than you. He's like, ""Where's the money,
white boy?"" I'm like, ""I could so dunk on
you.""  I'll just ""Gahhh! Ohh!  So and he keeps going, ""Where's
the money, white boy?"" And I go, ""I don't know!
I don't know."" And I notice I start
getting this, like-- my tone goes from scared
to, like, bitchy. Like, ""Where's the money,
white--"" ""I don't know!"" Like I'm an angry lady
at a restaurant. Like, ""I ordered that
Diet Coke ten minutes ago."" I think that's my one critique
of black comedians who do impressions
of white people is they always make us
so corny and over-enunciate. They really miss
the cuntiness in your voice when we feel like
we've been fucked over. Like, ""Can I speak
to your mana-- I need to speak
to someone."" That's like--whoo! That is angry pink
right there. I'm yelling at this guy like
we've been dating for 15 years. He's like, ""Where's the money,
white boy?"" I'm like, ""I don't know,
but we're supposed to be at my sister's
in a half hour.""  So he takes my keys,
and he takes my wallet. And the wallet that I had at
that time a girlfriend had bought me. ""Pulp Fiction"" is one of my
favorite movies of all time. And--yeah, my girlfriend bought
me the ""Bad Motherfucker"" wallet. And then I ran into a bad
motherfucker.  And that is how you define
irony, is when someone takes a joke
wallet off you that's supposed to be
interpreted as badass. This guy was like, ""Oh, this
guy sucks at being a badass.""  And then he takes my keys, and he's like,
""Don't fuckin' move."" And he goes downstairs,
and I hear him start my car. And if you drive
a piece of shit, you always kinda
want it to get taken. Like, he--
I heard him start that car, and I was like, ""Yes."" Fuckin' Toyota Tacoma,
two-seater. I'm already thinking about
the truck I'm gonna buy. It's perfect for the desert. It's fuckin' affordable. And I looked at the Kelley Blue
Book, right in my range.  He comes back upstairs,
he goes, ""You fuckin' move again,
white boy, I'm gonna fuckin' kill you."" I'm like, ""All right,
I'm sitting here.""  He goes downstairs. I hear him turn the car
into reverse, and I hear him pull away
and immediately think, did you rob me
or did I rob you? And then I realize I'm
wearing swimsuit as underpants, and he just took all
my laundry and I was like, I think you just robbed me. I'm gonna have to wear these
for the foreseeable future. I caught--I count
to about 30, 35, and then I just--
pure adrenaline-- break the plastic restraints,
hop over to the door, lock it, and light up that
Camel Light. Yeah, 'cause there's not a
better cigarette than after you've had a gun
pointed at you, where you're like, ""Ohh, that's
flavor country.""  As I light up that cigarette,
I see my cell phone. It's a flip phone, 'cause it's
2004, and it's dancing;
it's dancing. It's like...
 And I don't know the number,
and I pick up, and all I hear is, ""Yo, are you
dead?"" I'm like, ""Yeah, Amir, there's
good cell phone reception in
heaven."" He's like, ""Yo, that guy came
around the corner. ""I just got rid of the bag,
and I jumped and ran around the corner;
where are you?"" I'm like, ""In our apartment,""
I explain, like, the guy took our car; we're
gonna have to call the cops. 'Cause he's got my car, and
I've got to report this car stolen if I'm gonna get that
two-seater.  We come back, we clear the
drugs out of the apartment. I call the cops. They take down a report.
All this shit. Two weeks later, I'm at a bar
in Tucson, Arizona, and I get a call on my cell
phone. They're like ""Mr. Soder, it's
the Tucson Police Department. We have found your 1996 Dodge
Stratus.""  I don't think my response was
supposed to be ""fuck.""  ""All right."" He waits a second, he goes,
""Mr. Soder, also, here in the police
report, ""it says--it says your wallet
was stolen, Can you describe it for me?""  I go, ""Yeah, it's the one that
say 'Bad Motherfucker' on it."" And the cop without missing a
bit just goes, ""Well, clearly you've met a
badder motherfucker."" I'm like, ""Oh, what are you a
cop or an open mic'er?"" ""Who the hell makes that kind
of an inappropriate joke ""to a robbery victim? But all right, I'll take it."" And that's the thing, man,
like, you know, I've told this story
several times to my friends, and there's always this part
where I have to explain that comedians,
we use our sense of humor as, like,
a self-defense mechanism. When fucked-up shit
happens to us, we try to make
ourselves laugh, and that just kinda
makes it better. I made myself laugh
during the robbery. And all my friends are like,
""Yeah, you should get checked. That's fucked up."" But what happened
was during the robbery, when he had
the .45 on my head and he kept going,
""Where's the money, white boy? Where's the money, white boy?"" I was like,
""I don't fuckin' know."" And finally he goes, ""Where's
your money, white boy?"" And I go, ""I don't have any.
I'm broke as fuck.""  'Cause I was. He hears that and he goes, ""I find more than
a dollar on you, I'm gonna fuckin' kill you."" To which my response was,
""Does change count?""  You have never seen
an angrier criminal than someone wading around
pockets full of change searching for a lost dollar. The anger on his face, like I was just some
disappointing white piñata, was like,
""This guy fuckin' sucks!"" All right,
you guys are a lot of fun. Thank you very much.   - Dan Soder.  "
Matt McCusker,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZio3SPYgQ0, please give it up for Dan Soder everybody oh hey everybody hi how are you good Barry Williams berie all right perfect temperature it's the closest I'll ever get to playing in a band at a  house party in my entire life this is fun what a little adorable Thunderdome you guys have here it's fun  declining down those steps thinking I was

excuse me excuse me sorry uh did you guys have fun doing that blizzard oh boy guess who got high and watch people fall down outside his apartment what slippery street that 31st Street in Queens um the worst part of the blizzard is it's not when it's blizzard dinging it's uh like the two it's like the days Afters all just everything just turns to  muck and just then you get in a cab thinking you've es escaped the elements and then you realize you're standing in a  puddle in the cab yesterday I was like what the  is this I found a cell phone in the cab I was in last night has that ever happened to anybody it is  weird finding someone else's phone because you're like this is someone else's life it's ringing I don't know who Dawn is should I steal this phone is it an upgrade no it's an Android this guy how this guy's having Tough Enough go as it is probably give his phone back I picked up the phone and I was like hey if you want your cell phone it's going to be at the front desk of the Warwick Hotel and then I went and I dropped it off cuz that's I was thinking that's what a good person does but I forget how creepily deep my voices so whoever on the other end of that phone all they heard was if you watch yourself the come alone so no   cops give me back my phone ah it's a Mel Gibson Ransom clubes ah it's good to be in Williamsburg my one question about Williamsburg is hundreds of years from now what will hipster ghosts be like instead of going boo they're going to go I used to live her away before you did I'm from Denver Colorado originally and weed is now legal there for recreational consumption yeah no I hate it sucks you got to understand all of my Stoner burnout friends that were just supposed to disappear now run and operate dispensaries and temper they're like  weed SoMo that's what they do now and they're dicks about it they're like what do you get in New York do get like a low grade sativa  you Dennis you live in your mom's basement all right  somier for weed  regular Samo I don't like regular samoes that that bossy like you should try a oldw World 69 row with a decent cut of beef is that what I should do you fancy alcoholic why don't you stop swirling that glass and call your kids cuz they miss you you purple teeth wo watch tell some more lies and then fall sleep on the couch is that my mom I don't know I don't know where it went uh getting high I still get high a lot as an adult and it's not as half as fun that's why they started calling it medicinal cuz older potheads were like I need this okay  need this  it's medicine when I was like  20 30 and I moved to New York I'd  go outside drunk rip a joint like  society and its rules yeah now I just wait till late at night and I put on sweatpants and then I just get worried like am I ever going to pay off these loans I major  journalism as it's not you can't even  relax when you're high anymore CU everyone's all up in your  you can't there's no privacy we have all this great technology I can't have fun with it want to watch Netflix have a  panic attack that's what Netflix is to me I turn it on and like well here we go here comes the down spiral because you would think Netflix on paper Netflix it it just works it's like communism you're like yeah everyone should do that  looks awesome but then with the real Netflix in practice is your friends losing their  when they find out you don't watch the same television shows as they like you don't watch Dexter what the  is wrong with you I don't know why are you giving me friend homework I watched the wire not because I wanted to but because I had to to save six friendships turns out I liked it a lot I uh my friends are having kids which uh is ruining a lot of my friendships it is uh mostly just because the um the new version of children is uh they're terrifying more so than ever in history children now are way scarier because they're so so awesome with technology and still terrible socially you ever seen a three-year-old on an iPad it's crazy they like and then they look at you and they  like don't you Kaiser so me I just watched you do a bank transaction for the money overseas and I want to go up up   you not that dumb I know how s you are just shaking my friend's kid in the living room I truth be told I don't trust anyone under the age of uh 19 if you you know like um it's not because of the knockout game you guys still terrified about that you guys all still riled up worried about the knockout game which is the media just scaring rural white people that's what they love to do the news loves to scare yeah but the knockout game turns out there's like two people but everyone's like oh my god look out it's funny when my friend like I have a friend that tries to get too liberal about  and he he told me he's like dude ever since the knockout game I have been tensing up around groups of black teenagers what world did you live in when you weren't tensing up around groups of black teenagers I'm terrified of all teenagers they're a scary group they have the bodies of adults in the minds of children so I don't  them or fight them no thank you and I don't trust them they grew up with the internet you can't trust anyone that grew up with the internet you had to do most of your formative years without the internet for me to trust you cuz as a man if you grew up with the internet that means to me you never earned earned a jerk exactly what that means it means that you did not work for a nut I was the last I'm the last Bastion of like I got AOL in the mail sixth grade so perfect timing but earning a jerk like kids now can just Google  Blossom and they'll know what that is used to be if you wanted to learn about that you had to go through several red VHS tapes I just I'm a little bitter because earning your jerk means a lot to me like I used to have to  wait for a free weekend of HBO and then study the TV Guide like I was on trial for murder and that's the loophole out of this I beg Bikini Island 3:00 a.m. that's where we'll do it that's where I'll touch my dick to a titty that's all it's about just touching your dick to a titty in motion that's all you want to do stay up till 3:00 a.m. fight and sleep like some  up jerk off boot camp and just thinking I'm going to see a titty and then waking up 4 hours later in a sleeping bag in the living room very angry there's just some televangelist on the TV that's like L what happened there is no God my balls are still full uh I don't I don't it doesn't do it for me anymore porn doesn't do it doesn't get me off done I don't like it you know what my new thing is now I watch emotionally moving videos on YouTube until I Cry yeah but I don't call it crying cuz that makes it sound weak I call it face coming it's an orgasm for your soul why don't you try it yeah I could go online and watch two chicks blow a dude I could do that and touch myself like a caveman or I can go online and watch two animals that are friends that shouldn't be friends I don't know why that sick elephant in that Golden Retriever get along but my chest is tight I might bust a face nut go ahead watch people bang it out online good for you watching that simple  I'll be watching soldiers surprise their families yeah that's not the opposing pitcher that's your dad who was in Iraq why don't you hug on the pitching s I'm going to face come all over my keyboard it's always the same too when you jerk off the porn at the end it's always the same you're just like why did I do that it's so gross why but when you face come to a real watch a kid with Down Syndrome read an acceptance letter into college if that doesn't move you you're a monster you're a  monster and then face come all over yourself and then when you're done you're like there's some good in the world and I'm going to find hey you guys so much you guys are very fun  
Matt McCusker,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcT_-8gnkVg,"I phoned in jobs I think harder than anyone that's ever lived I worked in I never I grew up doing construction so when I got in an office it was just like it was alien to me I was like nobody does anything and it's like if you talk to people in offices they'll tell you like yeah dude the majority of my day is like pretending to be busy so I don't get fired it's  up but I would go in there what the worst job you had changing the fryer oil that was nothing bro the uh that sucked that BW uh cuz at that job there was they get they got mice all the time so like they they had glue traps for the mice and every morning I come in there' be three mice on glue traps I'd have to go out back and Crush their heads and it was just like it's a terrible way to start your day dude I started drowning them in Cherry Coke cuz I was like what would be a better way to die for a mouse than getting your head stomped on I someone told me drowning is like peaceful I I don't know I probably another who survived to tell us they just say they say like I guess when you start to drown maybe like it like I guess it's like a lack of oxygen like it's like maybe it's like doing whip itss like you start yeah maybe something like that but so I was like all right I'm going to start I started drowning mice and I was like Cherry Coke is like delicious so I was like that would be kind of tight to drown in Cherry Coke if you have to drown in some substance right Cherry Coke is  that yeah comedy is that thing where it's where it's where opportunity means preparation yeah I'm sure there's a defining moment in your career that you could probably say oh this is the moment that set me apart from everybody else yeah is there is there one or a couple not really I I remember when I first like first killed at an open mic and I was like holy dude that was cool I remember being being like Oh I can actually do this this is cool it was like a  five minute set it's like holy  three of my jokes just worked in a row this is amazing cuz you don't see people like at how long were how how old were you in comedy I was young like probably my was in like that first year and a half I the first time I really I would like get laughs here and there but I like start finish K and I was like whoa when you get that tight five yeah I was like holy  dude I I was volatile I would bomb do well bomb like it was bad the first year was crazy right and then once I got the hang of it a little bit it's mental illness right to to continue to get on stage not really knowing what the  you're doing you know what it's like mental illness BR I was sick I would get done I'd be like I'm the biggest piece of  in the world I get finished I do well and I'm like dude I'm  I'm the best bro yeah you like yeah man those yeah I think back to like early on in my you want to put your on wor you yeah I'll get it there you go I'll grab it for you there you go big dog thank you B yeah I think back to forever I think about think back to the early years of Comedy all those shitty bars that I used to perform at in La I don't think I've ever told anybody this bro when I first moved to LA I was terrified to go to The Comedy Store yeah I mean that makes sense I would go and also was 19 when I moved you know what I'm saying I'm one year out of high school yeah that's I would just go to the comedy store and buy a regular ticket like a regular person and watch yeah I did the same thing I would go to open mics and just watch that would help me I'd watch and i' watch people bomb and be like I can do that that's the bad thing about open Bike bro you got you got too many too many fly by nighters who will see terrible comedy and be like oh I can do that you that's what I did I was like I I used to watch Comedy Central when I was little I used to watch comic remix and be like I can do that just no no experience whatsoever you know how to use the push button yeah this one right this one yeah this one gets out there yeah this thing is actually let me make sure I don't hit you in the head no you good even if you hook me oh there you go I cross the lines you good I really in I really in you good  you good big dog are we starting to record already yeah we already recorded oh nice all right beautiful thank you thank you of course yeah bro don't even worry about it I should have wor my shades like you true those are the glasses that pretty much every white dude I grew up with wear yeah yeah I just discovered them actually I was doing uh the Maui gyms but I lose them I lose sunglasses all the time me too bro my daughter uh what are the ones called that were real big when I was a kid Oakley Oakley Oakley and they they she saw a pair um at uh what it Sunglass Hut whatever it's called where you buy sunglasses and she begged me for him and she took him to school and lost them the first  day I'm like baabe those are $100 sunglasses man what's going on y what's going on I've I've lost so many pairs so I started being like all right I'm going to buy cheap sunglasses they're just not the same once you get a nice once you get nice sunglasses I I Tred doing cheap ones and I have like five pairs of them kicking around I can't lose them and I bought I was like I broke down I was like I need nice sunglasses again I don't think people understand the difference between cheap and nice sunglasses but once you spend like over a 100 bucks on a pair of Shades you'll understand it you do I so I would be like oh these are the same I do the same thing and then you get like yeah the world like the like glass like glimmers are different it's  cool and they just feel better you put on cheap sunglass I'll get them off Amazon for like 12 bucks and I'm like it's not the same man so no I can't I can't lose these ones I got too much I had too many people being like dude what are you doing you lost five I literally lost a pair of revos pair of Maui Jims I think a pair of Ray bands I've lost like  five what kind of example are you saying for your kids so when they lose something you can't be mad right I never get mad at them for okay good good also I'm in the house with just it's me and all women so they dude even little girls know where stuff is it's weird like women always like where's the wrench she's like oh it's in the second drawer in the kitchen my daughter the what their memory true they have a good memory and they I think they think about like stuff like that all the time yeah they they they have more we I think men think about stuff on a stupid level what do you mean like say for instance if me and you see a dead cat right now and we think it's cool or a dead duck we'll remember where that dead Ducker dead we we can walk away and still direct our friends right back to that dead duck or I'm still I saw a dead Turtle recently I'm still talking about exactly you you we can do that we we think about stupid  I know exactly where it was I snuck up on it too I thought I was like dude I've never got this close to a turtle without it like popping underwater and I was like I'm like I was about to touch it I'm like it's  dead wow and I just watched it for a while and I'm like yep that's a dead Turtle dude you're you're spot on no one were dead I can tell you of like the last dead animal I think about them all the time I see a dead bird I'll was tell my wife like yo there's a dead bird I saw it on the walk like I'm trying to memorize tows dude exactly exactly man we memorize dumb  yeah but even little like my three-year-old knows I'll be like where's this and she's like oh it's upstairs and I'm like how the  do you know that already I think that's just the that's that comes from We're hunter gatherers you know what I'm saying like we we are made to protect and provide not really that's the domestic stuff is kind of for the woman yeah dude well especially when they go when they become pregnant women have like a whole biological drive to like re uh organize their house it's called nesting they for real like like birds bu like you know people they don't like it when you say like women like like to rearrange stuff it's just true like true look at Pinterest YouTube is dudes Pinterest is girls yeah it is and Pinterest is like where do you put a chair in a rug YouTube is like dude  this check this out you're like yeah  that dude I'm on your side watch me blow this chair up that's YouTube watch me blow this chair up what what what burns a chair faster gasoline or lighter fluid that's that's the type of  we have on YouTube it's true dude it's  true man and it's like you know especially again when they're pregnant you see it and it's like you have to just leave them be cuz they'll start  pulling stuff out of closets I used to be like the  are you doing like like leave it alone but then you're like all right you have this is like for your wellbeing it's like an extension of their minds of like where the shelves are and stuff I remember my youngest daughter this mom was pregnant cuz I'm black I I got the black what the  the hell is that yeah the NS right so I remember I remember my youngest daughter's mom was pregnant dudee speaking of how women change when when they're when they're pregnant and all those hormones are going through them we were sitting down uh at uh it's the you didn't you didn't really go to La that much huh yeah it it's this vegan restaurant on Melrose in Hollywood and we were sitting there eating and she just started crying and I'm like why are you crying she's like I don't know yeah yeah man that  sucks and you can't if you if you get into an argument God forbid it's like when they're pregnant you have to just let them go and it's like they're fully they got the full Mario star they're completely insane yeah that you can't and then just going to start crying and you're going to feel like a piece of  yeah you can't be like oh you  crying again no you have to be like it's okay cuz then you're I mean this is like a terrible thing to think about but then your like your unborn child is feeling all that stuff so you can't just be like well this is what  happens you have to be like it's okay but you know then they have to  that's so I was scared dude when she was pregnant I was like are you sure you're okay cuz I'm terrified cuz there's so much  that can go wrong yeah yeah pregnant bro I remember speaking of stuff that can go wrong when Luna my youngest was being born she wasn't supposed to come early but I had to fly to Georgia cuz my grandfather died and L my daughter was born as I was Landing in Georgia as I was Landing back in la oh okay that's good I was literally there for the I flew in that morning just just to be back with her yeah I flew in that morning for the funeral and flew out that night to get back and she was being born as I was Landing I just get a voicemail of her screaming her  head off oh man how early how early was she we had a scheduled induction the next day gotcha say us a lot of money true because she was supposed to be born at Cedar sidei yeah in Beverly Hills and we lived in Burbank so she was born at Providence Burbank which say those like 15 20,000 right now yeah cuz she she was my daughter was actually born in the ambulance whoa yeah  man say that's a ton of money I was happy true yeah but she was mad because she like I don't get to get my doctor I'm like yo you know how much money we saving yeah and the baby's so it works she's healthy so you just paid for the ambulance ride and whatever happens in the the ambulance ride in the hotel in the uh Hotel the hospital State what that's awesome that's real so like a $30,000 bill went to like 7500 oh cheat Cod that's sweet dude yeah cuz that it's it's insane I mean I guess I understand it's that expensive but it's like yeah it's like especially you're on the right Healthcare it's like 10 G's just to like go even with the healthcare it's like 10 grand well her mom was doing the most bro because this was even when I had less money I have now I was just starting to pop uh like right before the pandemic and um her mom was like yeah I need a private suite and I'm like yo we're not  be beon and Jay-Z yeah so she got like a she ordered a bigger room at Cedar s where the baby instead of the baby going to like a nursery the baby has his own little area in the room you can order a bigger room in the hotel in the hospital at C hospital at C I didn't know that yeah yeah that's tough the money conversations are tough especially you're like no like it's like it's like right now she wants my daughter to go to a different private school I'm like yeah what's wrong with this one I know you pick this one out what what is wrong with it uh she feels that Luna's too advanced for it it's kind of tight and I'm like you can't really tell a kid's advancement until they get to like second or third grade oh yeah yeah I don't think so what the  I had a friend who got held back in first grade though she's in prek oh how like everybody catches up around first second grade yeah I wouldn't jump the gun on that man so I'm like what what grade would she even go into like first grade no it's just to go to A Better Private yeah yeah dude I get freaked out with like the uh kids are on a treadmill now from like the time they're two years old it used to be like you know you got to just  around then you turned six you went to first grade you're still  around right now it's like this kid needs to be learning Spanish and it's like bro relax now they tell your kid is slow if they're not reading by four I it's insane dude I I I'm not a big fan of it and it's like we have our kids they went into they know it's daycare but it's like early childhood education it's like a school it's not like you know they do stuff but yeah they start like certain ones are like your kid has to be able to wipe their own ass by the time they're three and it's like dude what the  you wipe it ass wipe my kid's ass I'm not you don't even have adults who could do that the right way I know I learned when I was 30 how to do it properly but yeah dude it's like that that early childhood stuff is getting like freaky now where it's like even with my kids it's like dude they got to do this and if they don't get in this this place has a waiting list they go it's like bro  relax they're being babysat you know it's like they're being babysat right now although they're going to have to compete with like me and my videographer know a kid who's close to us that went to a private school one of the best private schools and he's not doing  with his adult life oh yeah so what is it like yeah School dude it's like if you get someone in a safe school it's kind you're kind of good if the school is to the point where like kids are getting like  up and there's guns in the school and like or just like there's tons of drugs or whatever it's like that's I see that but like yeah being like they're going to be exposed to French when they're for it's like cool I think it's good for kids to have a mix of private and public that's not a bad idea for social skills like I went to both I did both yeah I did I did I did Catholic school then yeah I went to Catholic School from like Elementary to the fourth and then from 5th to 6th I went to private and then seventh 8th I went to public for football then uh 9th and 10th public started  up in my 10th grade year my mom was like you're going back to private school if you don't straighten up so I went back to private school for a little bit and I like all right I ready to go back to public school why' you want to go to public school cuz man I wasn't like those kids yeah like we were we were lower middle class in Georgia mhm but at that private school those were like rich rich kids yeah yeah and when you're like when I was elementary school middle school you don't notice yeah but now I'm in high school and it's like God damn bro like you're 16 you got a better car than my mom like I we there's no relativity here yeah that makes sense hey yo what up man you know I'm trying to get

man I I remember thinking I used to always want to go to public school it sounded so cool I was like bro public school there's also like there was 23 kids in my class yeah so I was at like a pretty rural it was like it started out a pretty rural area I graduated from a pretty big high school Rutland in mon okay I think we had a graduating class at like 6 700 that's pretty big yeah my grade school was literally 20 2 3 kids the high school would have probably been about that maybe but my then I went to a all boys Catholic High School and that was like  weird that's it was so fun but it does it  you up with women though cuz you're you're just with dudes all you never know you don't even know how to socialize with women I don't I still don't know how to so it's like it  you up that's like the prime socializing years and I was like just getting like drunk with dudes and like smoking weed before school then you would you would get out like a they had like this schedule where it would be like F day and you got out like a period early so then you would just walk to the there was an all girl school like a 15minute walk and you would just stand outside of it and just like stare and like girls would come out and you just be like hi and then it was it was tight though then we had the exchange thing where like girls would come to like first period and boys would go to the girl school oh like that yeah and dudes will do when the girls came you see guys with  like jelled hair and  and all it was it was so like a body but all boy school was fun though cuz everyone was just  around the whole time like you could you had a fart loud as possible please as loud as possible everyone was like yes it was fun but I think it's good to like you know kind of temper or whatever that is around women like you learn how to like interact with it have manners yeah exactly yeah yeah my my mom struggled to send me to private school bro my daddy he made he made pretty decent money when I was growing up but he just wasn't  my mama never really fought him hard for child support and then like we would like we would get money here and there and and  I and he tried to cause a lot of Chaos in me and my mom's relationship yeah he tried to get me to stay with him really and then I didn't want to cuz like I don't know you yeah that's awkward I saw my daddy I think two or three times before I was a teenager and it was all for uh child support because a couple of times the state picked it up so they were pressing him to pay my mom oh yeah yeah but I mean he died recently and it's all good it was a weird situation yeah cuz he wasn't really around and when he uh died he had just recently got divorced kind of lost a lot pretty much everything through addiction but now it comes back around I was the one who paid for his funeral damn really yeah  his exwife was no none of the family yeah it was yeah  sucks crazy bro yeah but it's like it's at the end of the day I I'm reverent to him because he's he fathered me for sure yeah regardless of how shitty you are I still got to respect that sure and I want to make sure you have a proper barrier well I had them cremated but I still pay for the for sure still pay for the service yeah man that's  especially were you expecting to have to or was it a last minute thing um his ex-wife wouldn't give me an information about insurance and per day that he was at this funeral home it was Coston yeah so I uh I had his body picked up and uh sent to Mon and uh I just told my mom knew a guy who own a funeral home and I was like yo I want a decent service I'll use your chapel and I want to have him created and they told me a number and I said perfect I I here's my card check whatever you need and I I just didn't think about it it's like it's my parent you know what I mean yeah you did the right thing what what even happens if nobody comes around I guess his body would probably be sent to like a city morg yeah that makes where they keep you refrigerated yeah Jesus Christ man it was it was like damn near two grand to get his body and to get it transported that makes sense that funeral  is expensive oh dude it's well it's you can't not pay it I mean you can technically but like yeah and it's also like you know I don't know what would you charge to pick up a dead guy depends on how many I got in the area true kind of like a uber pool if I'm going your way then it'll be cheaper but if I'm just true yeah the guys picking up the Dead Guy are definitely just getting 10 bucks an hour too oh yeah they're not getting anything that's a funeral home deal where you're already paying for all the  and they're like yeah it's going to be $2,000 you can't be like I'll give you $500 you know I wonder let's I mean I guess you could let's talk turkey or yeah could you do like an Uber pool how many bodies got in the area it a surge how many bodies y'all got in area list comedians we're Wicked bro right no matter what we I already got a joke off of his death really yeah you have to I don't want to tell it on camera still working it I'll tell it to you later it is nice though dude that's my that's the weirdest thing about doing standup is like people are like how do you write I'm like dude I just live my life and just pray to God I get like little flashes of jokes and they come every now and again they're not always good obviously but I'll be like yes so like a new thing come like I just have to wait and like a new thing will just kind of like Dawn in my awareness and I'm like  yes I'm it just it's just fun when I get a new premise because I normally could just come up like how my jokes come up it'll normally be like a punchline and then I'll I'll like I just got this new one where it's like I don't like to suck titties with piercings because it feels like I'm licking it feels like my tongue is trying to solve a Master Lock code fa you know but it's like I got that now I got to put the stuff around it yeah yeah yeah kind of paint the picture yeah it is fun it is now I used to do the same thing I like like to have like a like a punch line basically now I just like to  around like if there's anything that just is like here's a funny thing to say to a room full of people and I'll try to now I'm just starting to try to like  around people yeah just  around and just see where it goes you know it just you get I get so sick of doing the same stuff man we're all  around I don't think people understand ComEd we y'all might like jokes and y'all might want us to see us tight all the time but after we per or what we consider perect perfecting the set we're ready to move on yeah like let me like yeah sometimes we'll have shows like let me go over here with these new premises yeah it's just and see and see what happens it's a thrill dude cuz then before like you know you're doing open mics and stuff you're living and dying by every set and then you're kind of like you know if I have a bad set I'm kind of like  it pisses me off but it's not like the I'm not like plunged into the depths of Despair like before but you're doing brand new material you're on that like you don't know what the  going on it just I like it I like doing that  around it's very fun I don't know if there's anything better than when a a new joke hits hard it's the  best when a new joke hits hard it's like oh yeah nothing else it's the best it for real is the best you're just like I knew it I knew that was awesome I must be tapped into something yeah yeah exactly it's the best dude you into water sports not really man like I I like water like I would I would do that those guys are rowing and stuff but nobody ever asked me to  do that you want to get in the canoe together I'll get in can be  sick you know how to swim yeah I can swim me too but it's a lot of  in this L we might get tangled up yeah true but like yeah no one ever asked me to be on the rowing team I would have crushed this that's definitely an all boy school yeah yeah we didn't have I was in Delaware so we were in like a small school so we didn't have this per se but I do see I I lived in Philly for a while for like 20 years and those boys are in shape yeah dude that's that's like a big deal crew rowing whatever is we had a in Philly there's a it's like Bowers row or something and there's on the skookul there's all these houses that are like the different schools and they all like the guys who are in that Sports stay there and they bust their boat out at 6:00 in the morning they all just  row damn it's kind of cool I guess I don't know it's one of those Sports too where like you can probably get like a scholarship cuz like who the  else yeah not not many yeah what school has access to  Lake it's like it's un it's like universities yeah exactly like the ones in Philly all can do but how do you get recruited like in high school I don't know man your dad has to be like a Cano master or something I don't when I went to high school uh when I played for Westside uh we had a a lake behind our field house did you yeah that's pretty tight but we also had a few state championship so yeah so it's like it's like it was warranted you know what I'm true yeah you deserve the lake at that point but yeah I don't I don't know how you get into the there's like certain sports like that like water polo like I don't know how you get into water polo yeah Polo water polo but they say now with it with daughters especially like get them into like lacrosse and  like weird sport yeah and they'll get a SCH like if you have your kid if your girl plays lacrosse for like some guy was just like  talking my ear off about this on a one of the like the transport things like a like the shuttle to an airport uhhuh or to like the rent car he was like dude you get your girls in the cross when they're six years old and then from there they'd play in high school he's like dude they'll guarantee I'll get they'll get a  blah blah blah we'll get a scholarship have daughters he did he he had like sons and one daughter he's like dude you I got a free  College just pick a weird Sport and like if you force your daughter to do it her whole life she'll probably get a scholarship yeah but I I I was forced to do it lot growing up I don't really want to oh yeah I'm not I'm not my daughter she's really thrilled about basketball right now so I got her a trainer I I bought her all the shoes that she thinks going to make her better that's cooland yeah headband orange band oh dude you need a look cool as  I never had I want always wanted the cool apparel playing basketball cuz I just played I would toss on the Shacks Shacks were the shack noses by rebot yeah they were bad shoes or the ones from Walmart Walmart I would toss all the Walmart Shacks just get like 45 blisters cuz you know he had two pair of shacks I had the I got the ones I think I got mine from Kohl's but it's same things cuz he had the ones he dropped with rebot called a shack nosis and he had the other ones with the twohand dun I had the twohand Dunkey Shacks they were they were tough shoes they were  not good Footwear dude yeah I always would buy like $20 shoes I I never I was always like a  about that where I'm like shoes are shoes who gives a  and you wear like I'd wear like $20 shoes and just like  your feet up and it actually makes a humongous difference yeah yeah it does what do you spend your money on now you got anything your kids what dude honestly I food it's just food and books I spend money onook I buy books constantly food what's your favorite restaurant in Austin so far I like every single place I go to yeah I go oh this is the best place ever yeah I thought the food in Philly was good but if you go from the Philly suburbs the Phil like the city of Philly you're like dude this food's amazing and then you go from Philly and pretty much anywhere else what's that old cheesecake place called in uh Philly what like the cheesecake boss I me cheese steak oh gyms Pats and Goos is it Goos dami yeah Pats and Goos no in Philly that they brought us at the shoe placeel D'Angelos D'Angelos is good too Isel cheese trying to think of what's the other one the CW word one with the good meat let me see I think I've heard of D'Angelos let me see CU it was always like pass andinos Ishkabibbles was a big one let me see  this all right there's a let me see what it's called Uh this  the meat was good okay maybe they do it it like started it like started with a c uh didn't it start with a c it wasn't capriottis they make more like sandwiches and hogies yeah I don't know I've never heard of d'angeles it's downtown the one that starts with a C I don't know damn yeah the two big one paninos Panos honestly they're like kind of a tourist trap yeah they're like every cheese steak every pizza place in Philly has I'm not trying to crush pasag genos it's just true they have better cheese steaks at pizza places and pass Pino's cheese steaks are like  tiny but Cleavers ah I've heard of Cleavers clever clever is kind of new that was like downtown bro yeah that's I heard is good yeah dud I'm telling you and ish cbles ish cbles is a big one is Big the dudes at uh God damn I can't think of nothing right the D what's the shoe story Rec call shout out to my boys at suplex the dudes at at suplex uh said it depends on who's working as to how good ish kbl is ah that makes sense yeah every every restaurant goes through phases where like it'll be the best and like if you start going there all the time you'll catch some like real they chefs are really temperamental too though so you have like a chef that'll be like all  up did you ever work in the kitchen before one of my first jobs was working at um at Zach be's Wings nice down in Georgia working on frier sucks yeah dude bro and when we first we open at 10:30 we would had to be there at 9: because we would have to halfway fry 500 Wings bro dude it sucks I quit that job in like two weeks changing fryer oil I wouldn't do it I'll be honest I didn't do it I pretended I wouldn't it's  the worst you got to reach in there and like scrub and it's like yeah I uh I faked the funk on the fry or I would be like oh  like dude it's smoking did you change that I'm like yeah dude I  changed it I don't know what the  going on I hate it changing for and dude working over that all day too you're breathing in just like toxic waste it has to be horrible it it is when they use when you use like canola oil or like uh what are they like polyunsaturated fats it's a really unstable fat molecule that's why they say saturated fats are bad for your heart because it's like a firm fat molecule so it gets kind of rigid those ones are a little wavier and bendier so they're all like oh they're healthier for you if you heat those things up they become toxic like some of them become like component parts in like Plastics and  carcinogenic how do you say that yeah carcinogenic it's carcinogen yeah heating up those and you look at it it's turning they turn like smokes coming off of it and it's like you can't eat you  eat that I'm I I'm a health nut dude I don't like thatu I mean now I am bro especially 2024 I'm doing bur Chrysler's 5K 5K yeah nice so I'm uh what's going on idiots bro idiots idiots in in Austin he's just screaming at idiots in Austin I used to do that to Golfers though we uh there was where I grew up there was a golf course like you'd pass it it was like 5 10 minutes away but like if you got had to go to like the highway you'd pass it golf course and we we would like some of the holes were right on the side of the road so you'd watch a guy like getting ready to swing you pull your car right next to like don't  up and he like you  do you golf no I I I I go to like a driving range but no I've never gotten into it it's too much time it takes like five  hours it's it's uh it's it's the male's version of female's brunch because you go out there and drink yeah hit balls around talk  get kind of sad yeah that's what it is talk each other it is kind of brunch life it is like a kind of a fake sport no off golfers it's a man it's the man's version of brunch it is that's what we get to do to feel manly you know what I'm saying it is Ash brunch life dude it's like 12  hours it's all day it's like I can't do that man I got stuff to do yeah I've been golfing a few times with the guys here man and uh yeah I'm like y'all ain't got like no twoh hour course dude i i n 18's ridiculous okay honestly I'll go to a driving range if I can hit the ball high in the air I'm like  yeah that's 10 points yeah I'm might how how how uh how many yards you consistently drive not that far dude I was uh last time I was at the range I was consistently driving about 290 300 no I can I can have a hard time making it like not completely Veer to the right I can hit it with a pitching wedge for some reason I can use a pitching wedge like dead straight every time and I can get it to go like 75 yards with a pitching wedge everything about golf sounds gay yeah cuz I remember when I was at uh when I was at Top Golf the guy was like yeah you you need a driver with a stiff shaft bro chill like pause yeah dude pause bro yeah it's all yeah it's like some guy that's like holding your butt and be like twist your legs like that yeah Top Golf is sick though I will say I like Top Golf that is actually really fun cuz again you're just hitting the balls out you know you don't have to get like hypers specific about where it lands like dude come on man I got to get it 300 yard into that tiny hole exctly and not humiliate myself hitting it 45 times it's like let me just hit it out into the clear open Skies let's just get pumped up on getting this ball in the air yeah Top Golf is is I rather I'd rather do Top Golf than go actually golf yeah dude I can eat I can sit there and eat although the golf cart driving getting to is also an excuse for dudes to drive drunk yeah driving golf carts drunk I'll give you that that's  tight that's a lot of fun on a closed course yeah yeah then just  cracking the  out of a ball I'm building a um I'm building my house in Georgia now and uh my backyard is a golf course really yeah you just say golf was gay I mean I oh you're on a golf course yeah I'm on a golf course I thought you said you're building a golf course oh hell I'm not that rich I was I thought you meant like a chip like a hole you're going to throw chip on but you're moving on to the golf course yeah that's cool that's nice and Scenic also golf courses I now where I live in Austin there's a golf course like right across the it's like you walk a little bit it's right across the street I kind of like golf courses now just as like a buffer zone you're right cuz they keep it's like a trap for the Riff Raff it's like a it's like you know it's tough terrain that's why I think they're originally invented they just clean  like poor crackheads out of the sand TRS that's funny trying to get to like the houses they just  tumble down the hill you know what the number one thing I'm AIG I'm a big fisherman you know number one thing that sold me on the golf course is what there's 10 Lakes there yeah true and all I got to do is by a membership to the golf course and I get to Fish all of them that's not bad D I've come around I have come around on just like cuz we were looking to move and my wife was like oh look there's a near golf course I'm like I'm G to get hit with a  ball I was like I don't want to get hit by a ball and then you know I apparently I don't think you have to worry about that I think they set the houses up so you don't get hit by balls but you think you're going to stay here I hope so I mean once my once my kid is like five well two year I have like it's like a two-year period once my kid's my oldest kid's five I'm not going anywhere for 15 years I I don't want to be having them moving around all throughout school like I just don't want to if I have to obviously it's one thing I'm I'm building my house in Georgia just because real estate cost so much here yeah that's good live to buy I'll still have my apartment here but when when I'm ready to relax I'll go and get it spread yeah yeah I'm going to I'm going to say my mortgage is going to be cheaper than my rent oh yeah easily Al everyone was like go down to Texas you can get a house with a  pool and it's like way cheaper it's not here you got to go south or far north yeah exactly yeah it's funny if you leave like 30 minutes from here you got to have a million dollars to play in Austin yeah you got to div buy get something decent yeah exactly but but yeah I like it though man but now I'm just thinking about like I just want to get like a house in like a safe neighborhood that's all I care about man once they once my kids get older I don't want to  I hear C the park is about to be the next boom in it's nice over there yeah probably Cedar Park is where all the kid stuff is too yeah oh really they have all the kids play places and all that  yeah I was looking at Kyle which is South yeah or uh yeah I was looking at C and uh bua yeah but then it it was like 35 minutes to the club 40 45 with traffic yeah dude cuz you can go to like San Marcos I've heard is nice to where it's like yeah but my my thing is work yeah like you leave the comedy club you've had a few shots you don't want Drive 40 minutes home n that's tough that's a that's a far drive 15 easy I can walk home in 11 minutes from the CL that's nice too yeah that's I especially if I'm like kind of tired and dug in throw a 35 minute drive at me I'm going catch you tomorrow but yeah 15 is e I can just catch a lift in Uber and I'm down there in few seconds anywhere I can lift back home for 15 for 15 bucks yeah exactly yeah but no that that's that was the reason too cuz my wife was like you know cuz we were in Philly we're in like a row home in Philly and it's like you know you've been out there the houses are just like cuz I didn't know I went from the Philly suburbs to Philly for 20 years so my wife's from Chicago and she was like this layout sucks I'm like what are you talking you don't know anything shut up like she no in Chicago you have space you this I'm like man shut up and then we came out here and I was like oh wow yeah this is I see what you're saying the one thing I do like about Texas bro I felt like I never knew real prices in my life until I came here what do cuz I had been in La for so long oh God yeah I didn't know what I didn't know like like you come here like I I was never able to save money in La yeah it was always like damn I'm down to my last $300 or $400 I got I got to show this weekend we good but here I'm able to save some money with taxes and everything dude I filled my car up at the pump here and I was like it stopped and I was like oh this must be  up cuz the price was so low that I was like there's no way and I was like yeah it's  it was like 27 bucks 269 like 269 a gallon yeah yeah n dude it's it's cool man I like it man like Philly just got out of control because I don't know what it was like here but like Philly is a city where you have like you have real gangs there and like it's like when they with the co stuff happened like oh everyone's going to be wearing masks and I dude I was like this is as soon as it happened I'm like the murder rate's going to Skyrocket the sh the shyy mes the the shy masks are like illegal in Philly now they now they are dude and it's like I don't know man it's a bad idea it's like they were here's the thing they were illegal before you couldn't  walk around with them in a store and  and everyone goes yeah that makes perfect sense you can't conceal your identity in a store it's like you can't hide your license plate so why can't I hide my face right and it's also like dude I don't know man we we got stuck damn we're  catching NE n dude nematodes what the hell is that I don't know I saw it on Doug Doug yeah I saw they had a Neema toad there we go you got yours I think so I think I'm out of the muck let see if I can get I used to get so stoked though when I would like catch sticks when I was little my rod would bend I'm like yeah I got something on there let me see if I can get it my worm is  tight watch your head my bad all right ah God damn it my yay poor worm bro there we go all right my bad there we go I'm G whip this guy back I'm g go far I'm going long bass master I'm gonna get run over by a boat I got right there yeah let me reel that in that was a good cast yeah that was that was the old tournament bass master cast but no dude they pH soon as the pandemic started it was just like like Philly always had crime but it was cool like everyone be like oh man it's so crazy down there and I was always like it's fine once the pandemic happened and all like the protest and all this stuff like we had cop cars getting firebombed all this stuff she was like whatever like you're watching it happen to your house you're like oh man I don't want to see this  and then right the um those dude everyone's covering their faces and the  murder rate just Skyrocket it because it's like it makes sense like if you're just if you're like a I don't know if you're like a liberal-minded person reading the news you're like you hear about stopping Frisk and you're like yeah that's terrible and it's like yeah that that's bad if someone's be like yo let me see if you have a gun that's bad I guess but like dude if people are getting like shot every weekend and then there's dudes walking around with like ski it's like dude that right before the pandemic was the thing you wore before doing a crime with a gun MH and then it became it became it just looks cool so I like I'm going to look cool now and wear this thing and it's like well dude that's kind of synonymous with like robberies armed robberies yeah so how about you  don't you I don't know but cuz Philly has a camera system and it would like it's pretty effective at catching homicides cuz it's like Philly's a square grid there's not like trees and  you can hide behind if you come out and shoot somebody there's cameras that are going to watch you and see where you go well if you had a mask on for like five months it's like you're in this house you go to this house with a mask that house now it's like nobody knows who and dude it just everyone I said I was like dude if I was running a gang I would have been killing people that was a perfect time that's a no better time to start everybody got to have mask on yeah yeah it was like dude this is it you can start robbing story you can start doing anything cuz your face is concealed but yeah man I don't know but it just started the murders really and like once you have kids too it's like you look at yeah you start worrying about yeah different  we you like the playgrounds there would be a guy with uh he'd be like oh the guy just rele he he uh let off like 50 shots at like 7:00 a.m. in the morning at the playground we will go to and it's just like well all right I'm not living here anymore I'm not doing this why but why he dude didn't even kill the guy too dude the guy got hit once and like walked away on skat there's there's 49 bullets now just  traveling you know whatever miles per hour per second or whatever who's that angry at 7 a.m. that was a good that was literally someone did ask me that like dude like that's so early for that I don't think when people honk their horns that early but yeah just shooting  although that maybe that was like the night before maybe the sun came up on the guy and he just  saw that guy I like I'm getting it's also dude 50 shots and you didn't get you didn't kill the guy yeah what kind of gun you got did you reload like I'm I'm a gun guy so it's like you had a 50 round drum that could be possible I don't know what it is yeah if he had a 50 round drum on a pistol which that fish just jumped out there o that will get it but if he had a 50 round drum on a pistol that would kind of be the accuracy would kind of go away cuz you're just firing as fast true yeah also you got to be so scared dude like if I'm shooting somebody outside in broad daylight like there's no way your hands straight you're just I I think that's why you know a lot of criminals you know crime is synonymous with drug use because you're like doped up or peeled up yeah so you're not even really thinking about consequences or that you're about to take somebody's life true you know what I'm saying no show hold up oh you got stuck a yeah I got stuck I'm try this little hole over here come on now get out of there yo these are my new favorite POS these  get out there this  worm man I almost want to like let him go after this he's been doing so well where' I put my little oh man so where did you and uh Shane meet we were doing a comedy show on top of an ice cream shop so this place was like his place was insane uh so it was 2009 and the only reason I know the year is because I won Philly's funniest so I was like oh wow yeah dude I was I was feeling myself I was like dude I'm the best this is awesome so I'm walking around I I had done the show I think like the night before the weekend before whatever it was so I had done their show the ice cream shop so I just went back there to like hang out and like just chill maybe do a spot and uh I had never heard of Shane never saw him I just I didn't know him at all and I'm I'm just sitting there watching and I'm watching you know Shane I don't I don't know who he is I'm watching him do standup and like dude he he's just funny as I'm like because you know when you're like doing open mics and you see another guy who's like very funny you're like you're almost like whoa like what the  right so he's he's killing I'm like this guy's  hilarious who is this guy and then he did a joke and like it was just one of those I don't know what it was I genuinely don't remember what it was about but it was like a very hot button issue at the time it was one of those jokes where it was like to soon hot button issue Crowd Goes completely silent I'm like oh  well I guess he lost them and then like so I like to start talking to someone 30 seconds later the crowd's laughing again and I was like how the  did he come back from like that's  there's no way you can come back from that and then after the show we just started talking and uh I just I showed him a video of a guy jumping off a roof and he showed me a video of a guy getting eaten by a bear and we were just boys he loves those videos bro the craziest  that he puts on his  story I know do you have a knife on you no a lighter nothing I got you don't got no I got nothing can you got car can I see a car ke yeah that might be better than the one I got see but yeah that's how we met and then we started living together pretty shortly after that thanks yeah one of these should work but yeah he was from the first time I saw him I was like damn this guy's  hilarious that's dope and this was early on too this was 2009 maybe 2010 I forget but yeah yeah I know Shane's been at it for a while I think he was a couple years older than me but he started hella young yeah I think he started and went and left and traveled abroad then came back it was very funny it's a funny origin story especially to watch him back then too like you got it doing a joke that the whole crowd was like no you better not and being like well that was that had have been the kiss of death for the set then like dude 30 seconds later the whole place is just like ah I love when that happens yeah it was pretty it was kind of sick because a lot of my a lot of topics that I like to talk about it very controversial yeah oh bro I can't wait till this video comes out I was doing a show shout out to everybody that came to Kansas City uh outside those people who tried to ruin my night can't ruin my night though they sh ruin your name I did a uh I did a George Floyd joke and uh I don't I don't really care if I offend you because it's all comedy that that might not be how I really think or what I really believe and you're coming to a comedy show yeah so I did a George Floyd joke and this and I guess there it was older gentleman there who was kind of you know out of the de out of the demographics of people that normally come to my show but then um when when when I saw the rest of them it oh it was like oh you with like your that's your son and like your grandson so the older people who were there got offended by the George Floyd joke but the youngsters it was like when they got offended you saw like a Ruckus going on at the table like the old ones wanted to leave but the young ones are like bro like what yeah we're we're we're chilling yeah so um they got up the old dude came to my came towards the stage he's like you stoop low for that joke

give them a chance and if they do it again I'm like all right man get the  out you're done yeah but I'll give people a chance I like all right dude you know how do you do a lot of crowd work or no a little bit here and I I do it like I've been doing more and more of it lately because it's it's kind of fun I'm like notoriously bad at it I it just gets like awkward very fast yeah or like yeah like I recently I delved into the world of crowd work recently and I saw a dude just like leaning against the wall and his I thought he had like his arm in a cast uhhuh and he he was like talking just like chatting about like something like quietly it wasn't even being like ridiculous but I saw him lean against the thing and uh I was just like bro like what's up with your arm like what happened like I thought he was in a cast he's like he like looked at me like don't like gave me the hand signal and then I'm like oh you lost your  arm  dude my bad I was like minutes in I like damn it dudee that how do I recover from this yeah I just you have to double down I just double down like well if you want to keep the other one shut the  up bro I was uh yeah you have you have to double down man you can't be like I'm so sorry I was on the road with Lou CK um I just saw some bubbles over there where by your cork yeah looks right there something's over there yeah turtle or something yeah probably tur so you're on the road what was other thing that you called it from dou a neemod neem could have been a Neema you were on the road with Lou said yeah I was on the road with Lou bro and uh it like that damn swarm about the capiz bro like leaning to one side oh no right they might Little Rascals dude it could be like Alfalfa and  lady that Swan is taking on water dude he might be getting head dude yeah that's how many of those swans do you think flipped it looks hard to flip y yo you see this dude oh ah maybe I'm just  delusional maybe I'm on the  no something was moving it something was nibbling me it's all right all right worm gone let me see call a oh my worm ah look at that they ate some of it some some of it yeah something was  with it I knew it probably a  turtle I hate when I hook Turtles dude oh I've never that would kill me yeah cuz you pretty much got to kill the  Turtle I love Turtles man what I guess you'd have to kill it cuz that it would bite your  finger off yeah how do you kill it uh depends on what I got pet like a pocket KN just put it straight through it yeah brutal I mean I grew up in the woods I do I I I've had to like grab a raccoon by my hand no we we grew up everyone gets so turned off by this talk when I was little was like we would catch fish and put fireworks in their mouth and light them and people get  up like dude I don't know that's what we did yeah we didn't know any better I walked up to the pond one time and my cousin well I won't say I have a bunch of cousins one of them was just there hold a frog on its back and had a broken piece of soda can which was cutting it  just opening it up to like look and we like looked at the Frog's Beating Heart and we were just like whoa cool I never was like I  up I was like I was a frog that's type of  we used to do bro yeah people get get real people get weird about that though yeah we would catch catfish throw put like the fireworks in their gills and just blow them up why is that so funny to me cuz I'm sick I'm a sick human being it was funny it dude when you're little you're  10 right funny yeah you know I mean now obviously if I saw my kids doing that I'd be like yo chill the  out but it makes sense especially from like I don't know it's like you're catching animals and like you  kill them that's you know that's how we eat you know why can't we entertain ourselves by killing them and not not e them true very true bro and then be friends with dogs and cats only cuz we had to dissect a frog in high school and like yeah we had to do a a frog and an owl pet like a poop so I guess owls uh vomit these pellets out oh yeah yeah after they eat like rodit and  SC I think yeah that's pretty cool that was fun we had to do a frog and then the older kids had to do a pig but then someone stole the pig from biology class and threw it in the toilet so there was just a dead pig in the toilet all day was pretty and dude and again I it spread like wildfires You' be sitting there like yeah there's a dead pig in the toilet everyone would make a pilgrimage throughout the day and be like that's a dead pig in the toilet dude that might be the truest thing I've ever heard that's so funny bro it's so beautiful out here man dude it's it's hard it's hard to beat nature oh dude it's impossible water too just like I can sit I can just sit and look at it and I'm almost like man that's that's what I love about fishing man because like when I'm really fishing and not filming a podcast I rarely get skunk but even if you get skunk you're out here chilling dude yeah no it's you really can't go wrong that's I'd always just the deep sea fishing when I was little I'd be like bro you ever take your kids fishing no well teaches them patience yeah we went I didn't have any I didn't work on me every time we did it we went we went to the Poconos and like again they're so young but my daughter we would like cast it for her and let her kind of hold it and like they they just like watch you real stuff in and get ped but it is kind of exciting when you're little and you see like the fish coming in you get to hold it and my youngest she can fish for about 15 20 but there's this place that I like to fish here uh and they have a playground right at the lake it's perfect so I bring my mom and I'm like yeah take her over there and then my older she'll chill with me go play come back that's cool that's perfect yeah no that's perfect yeah it's pretty perfect man it's it's kind of the best yeah I D I could set a chair up here and just sit here and  stare that'd be fantastic I mean you you get the best of both worlds cuz over here we got a little bit of woods yeah but then over there you got all the sky well Austin skyscrapers yeah they stopped building that building which one I think that was a Google building or apple or Facebook oh yeah yeah why um because they built it uh if I'm getting the story straight they built it uh during the pandemic but then they realized everybody can work from home oh wow say it's like cap their skyscraper that's probably like 800 million probably a billion dollar building yeah I'd imagine cuz look at this it's supposed to be a sale and it's not even finished what is it supposed to be that one over there to the left yeah the on I see it no no no to the left of that one that weird like yeah that's supposed to be a sale oh God see it's not finished oh yeah true they didn't put the tip of it on yeah so they just  stopped yeah man that makes sense dude these things have become kind of obsolete gigantic Sky I mean I guess they make cool  condos now yeah nobody needs a bustling like 30th floor office space for 200 people I would even want to live on the 30th floor no dude it's scary bro I think my bill building got uh 30 floors and I they were like I like no I put me in the middle yeah my elevator's bad enough yeah true waiting I never really I never understood it I was always like get me like a house and a lawn but like we were in we stayed in Chicago one time we were in like a condo downtown and we were up like super high and it did look kind of nice like at night time the lights would You' see the lights in everyone else's place and people put different color lights in their building and it would just like until you have a storm yeah  dud storms are not like I have all Glass Walls bro yeah storms are not cool and you can feel the building moving a little bit every building supposed to sway a little bit  that yep no I can't do that yeah I would like to watch them watch them would be cool but yeah as soon as I felt myself move I'm out I can't do that even like going over walking over a bridge sometimes like enough cars go on it you're like have you ever played that scenario out in your head like if the bridge collapses like how would you you survive it when I drive across bridges for some reason I think I can survive if I drive in the Middle Lane it's so stupid like you're going down but yeah when I'm whenever I drive across a bridge because I'm like all right if the bridge collapses cuz I watched so many movies I'm like it'll collapse from the outside and then like in a movie I'll drive faster than it and you know that one big chunk of concrete that just misses your car it'll be like a movie so I'll be in the Middle Lane while the the back of the damn fish will just throw yours right there that you see that swirl oh yeah yeah yeah that was here we go telling you man I I swear to God I saw something over there the worm lives let me real mine in see what I can all right we got to catch a fish on well we caught one with uh my god oh it was a  duck underwater Oh that's what that was yeah little baby duck damn it dude that was probably was  with me earlier I don't know how true it is someone told me on the fishing shows they have dudes in scuba suits that like swim underneath and yeah my gr will say that dumbass  that's my dad used to say my said that dumbass  my dad would that seems so expensive he's like dude they got a guy in a scuba suit hooking fish that just sounds so you know how hard it would be to catch a fish by hand it sounds so stupid my Grandad used to say that bro when I when I watch Bill Dance and  there's a guy under water hooking the fish that's what say oh in bro oh F dude that's so I thought that was my dad I believed him I'm like yeah they definitely did that they got to catch something they come up with the crazy scenario or yeah I guess they just have like a couple good days and you save the footage but the old man in the SCU suit at the bottom of the fishing show just  like no I saw uh do you still watch fishing shows no so my buddy milikin he uh he has a you he's like probably one of the biggest YouTube fishermen on uh on on social media right now like he makes a living just going places and fish and I ask him I'm like yo you ever like and he's like bro sometimes it takes  two days to get a full episode really yeah Jesus and he's like I'm talking about like two full like eight hour days what did you tell him about the scuba suit technology no I I should I like bro why don't you got  scuba man Scuba Steve where sco just swimming underwater gripping big fish with their bare hands yeah that's total  now that I think about it that'd be so I mean you have to be out of frame you have to grab have a aquarium tank of like giant fish then they just like plunge under water hold a fish underwater keep it from swimming away which we know fish are slippery and you and for some and then hook it and he can't breathe because we'll see the bubbles true so he has to hold his breath while he's while he simultaneously hooks the fish because if he breathes we'll see the bubbles and then yeah true yeah back then too they didn't have like the editing technology I don't think to like edit those big bubbles out cuz yeah there would be huge bubbles coming up yeah well we we got to the bottom of that where's your dad from we grew up right outside of Philly oh okay so he's not I maybe it's a southern thing no no my girl used to say all type I think it's just haters dude just being like yeah he's got a scuba man on I dude I've never I didn't think anyone else ever said that he's got a scuba man that's so dumb that's so dumb believe he used to tell me I believe you know those signs that say no parking there's like P on the side of the road like a p Circle slash I thought until I was 20 that there were no peeing on the side of the Rogues but I was like no you can't pee there you can only pee over there I thought it was no peeing and then there the king the thing that killed me the most is we were at a uh they did trash my family all did trash and Demolition and we would go to like like scrapyards all the time when I was little so we're in this one like junkyard and like a cat came up my dad was like be careful that's a  guard cat that's like a junkyard guard cat and I was like for real he's like yeah dude they have guard cats they're worse than guard dogs he's like they'll come up and just like get your eyes and I dude was like telling someone in my 20s about like I was like dude some of you guys use guard cats instead of guard dogs and I'm like what the  are you talking about I was like a godamn it man it's too many that he just like made up on the spot that never told me we'll be like that and we're comedians we'll have a lot of stupid  to tell our grand dude it's so fun making it is fun to like make  up and tell kids and just leave them be like all right I tell my my daughter's convinced that like they're just allig every sewer there's tons of alligators and the different size holes of for different size alligators and she thinks like people walk around and like release like the big manhole that's for the mommy the daddy alligator if there's like a medium one like a gas line or like the small ones that's she thinks people just feed baby out it's so funny they have no  clue how anything works and it's very funny just give him a completely wild magical depiction I made my daughter get off Tik Tok because she was really convinced that uh pigeons were drones and she was like why have you never seen a baby pigeon I was like bab like I've never seen a baby  either but they exist yeah true you know what I'm like shut up you ever seen a baby bald eagle no yeah exactly but we yeah I've never seen a lot of baby birds but they like I've never seen a baby hummingbird that's so  funny man yeah I mean that's uh that's also no baby pigeons is like that's she's on like the outer rim of just a Vortex where it's going to I mean what lies at the bottom of that it's pretty  wild yeah man the thing that has me right now that's my I haven't read I haven't read about it just cuz I haven't like I hadn't have time yet but the  the tunnels the htic Jew Jewish guys in tunnels right now I just am like I don't know what's going on with it but I'm just really really enjoying the fact that that's like you know it's become like a you know Meme based not even like just like a meme with like words like it's just a thing now it's like a block of content that's captivating like the national attention and it's that's going to be a very fun one because then the news has to like do their thing like well here's the thing about tunnels and acidic Jewish people it's just so fun that that's like captured the national imagination right now and a dude that got caught emerging from it it's just like he  up you can't dude if you're wearing that stuff you cannot be  with tunnels dude it's just too much you can't now now having the internet if you're htic Jewish dude don't  with tunnels cuz it's just too funny for everybody else and it just brings up it just dude it just brings up too many good questions did y'all get the blueprint from uh from uh what's the Mexican cartel dud now El Cho did y'all get the blueprint from Choo dude they might have got Choo out he might have hit up the histic juw and they got Choo out possibly bro but also it's it's oh oh come on now could that just be leaves yeah I'm very very pleased about that whole thing cuz then there's dudes like I told you they had it's like dude you didn't know they had tunnels get out of here we're trying to catch a fish oh no no they got your worm oh dude there's a big one right here really oh no it's a turtle oh he's gone he's gone he saw you he's right there he's out go in peace Turtle damn you can actually see in here oh yeah you got those glasses on got the shades that was I thought it was a big fish that was that was just a tur  fall in like a dumbass oh I don't think we're going to catch a fish today buddy I don't think so man do one more do a little do a little side cast how about that there we go that's a good spot scuba man please scuba Man start praying to the scuba man SC man please oh but yeah that's that's pretty much my agenda for the week I got to go do stand up this weekend follow the tunnel story San Diego yep San Diego follow the tunnel story and then you know the nice thing too I like about podcasting that's like gives me a lot of pleasure uhhuh there's a lot of this is what pumps me up to just do them in general I just think about dudes at work the vast majority of people that work hate their job I've hated every job I've had for the most part there's been a couple I thought we all right but still like I had a kind of like you know I could only do it for so long right I do enjoy just letting people mentally escape from just  drudgery exactly that that is the joy that podcasting brings yeah uh I I I'm pretty sure this podcast gets more viewers because uh you know a great percentage of this podcast is the Aesthetics true you know but you can still watch  at work I did it yeah I  I phoned in jobs I think harder than anyone that's ever lived I worked in I never I grew up doing construction so when I got in an office it was just like it was alien to me I was like nobody does anything and it's like if you talk to people in offices they'll tell you like yeah dude the majority of my day is like pretending to be busy so I don't get fired it's  up but I would go in there what the worst job you had changing the fryer oil that was nothing bro the uh that sucked that  blew uh cuz at that job there was they get they got mice all the time so like they they had glue traps for the mice and every morning I come in there' be three  mice on glue traps I'd have to go out back and  Crush their heads and it was just like it's a terrible way to start your day dude I started drowning them in Cherry Coke cuz I was like what would be a better way to die for a mouse than getting your head stomped on I someone told me drowning is like peaceful I I don't know I probably another who survived it to tell us they just say they say like I guess when you start to drown maybe like it like I guess it's like a lack of oxygen like it's like maybe it's like doing whip itss like you start and  yeah maybe something like that but so I was like all right I'm going to start I started drowning mice and I was like Cherry Coke is like delicious so I was like that would be kind of tight to drown in Cherry Coke if you have to drown in some substance right Cherry Coke is that true although what would that be like chugging a two L you ever chug a lot of soda at once and your throat just  gets  up yeah I might have been doing those mous or micea disservice but no that wasn't the worst job the worst job I dude so it's like it's split so I I've done like my family does demolition so demolition is hard work it's like you're breaking stuff it's kind of sick though cuz you're breaking stuff but the one time we were doing this building it  sucked cuz like we couldn't open any of the windows up cuz it was like the it was like asbestos or something in the window window so like you weren't you had to wait for asbesto guys to do all that stuff so we had to like work in this building there was really there wasn't a ton of ventilation they like opened doors eventually but we were just getting in there chopping down like drop ceilings like little stuff and there had been pigeons it was an abandoned building so pigeons had taken up residence in there so they  all in the  tops of these Dro ceilings and it was dry so when you you know you get bird flu it's like when you breathe in pitch and  and all like bird  yeah bird  dry you can touch it no problem but once it gets wet all those germs and viruses and  get like they like wake up or something so I would drop these drop ceilings and dude it'd be like a bare concrete floor the drop ceiling would drop cloud of pigeon  and then to the point where you'd come back into the room and there'd be I swear to God like a  half inch of pigeon  covering the entire floor and it's just falling down your back and you're sweating that   sucked um but dude I I swear to God working in an office was the worst cuz C like like working construction is physically kind of like laborious but like dude you just Crush coffee and start breaking stuff that kind of ruled and you at least like you're exercising you feel good at the end of the day right when I worked in that office I would come home and just be like  dude I just sat inside all day didn't even do I didn't use my mind I didn't use my body I just  sat there that  sucked man under underneath like fluorescent lighting but I used to do a thing where you know you can set your screen saver to like not come on basically right so I would work in an office and I would turn my screen saver off totally and I had two bosses but both of them worked in different states so one guy worked in like North Carolina the other guy worked in Texas so I would call the one guy like yo the other guy's got me really busy today like you might he's yeah just and I call the other guy like yo that guy's got me real busy so I would tell both i' pit them against each other they didn't they were in different states they didn't really tell talk to each other I hope they didn't but I would tell them both that I was busy Set my screen saver for never come on and then I would just  leave all day and like walk around do stuff that was cool but that was still I swear to God that was still the worst job I've ever had cuz it was so boring yeah I would my friend work down the street and I would do things where I would like oh what's that nothing I would sit outside I would wait for him and like try to like see if I could like stalk his movements so like if he was going to lunch I'd see if I could like watch him go to lunch without being detected oh wow and then at one point I knew a time he would get out of work so I would like wait for him and like try to scare him outside it was that was kind of fun if I would have had a job with a person like you it wouldn't have been so bad like like friends at a job also can make a job better that's true but no I was uh dude they I actually I I was in there just refusing they would be like do this and I'd be like no I'm not doing that I would refuse tasks I like I'm not doing that so we had to read the story in college did you ever hear about bleby scrier no it's a short story where the whole story is this guy and they're trying to get him to do jobs in an office and you would go I would prefer not to do that that's the whole the story is about them be like what the  man you can't just say no to your your work so I started doing that in this office job being like yeah I'm not doing that and it actually they were like it was an internship so they were like H  I guess we'll give it to someone else then so then I thought in my head like yo you you have total control over your job as an employe then I was a dog walker and they Tred to give me this like shitty assignment and I was like yeah I'm not doing that and they're like you're fired you're fired right now oh  yeah I I think the worst job really was uh restaurants pizza delivery kind of sucked really yeah I was delivering pizza in the hood man I was getting like it wasn't good I had to like same time money Pizza stuff dudes would like grab the pizza box I'm like that'll $31 sir and they're like doing a little it's all there I'm like oh let me count it you're holding pizza and it's it was yeah that was not good that was deling peace in the hood was not the move I don't want to die for a large piece yeah dude especially too at the time I was like I didn't have any money so I was like kind of living and dying by it so I was like bro no way because then it's like I'm not not only I not getting tip but like yeah if I get  on this large pie in this two L like I'm not trying to for $31 the pizza place oh you had to pay for it they stole it I don't know I never I never got to that I don't think they would fully held me on the hook but I don't know you never know oh that  pesky Turtle bro yeah a little turtle probably still messing I'm trying to think what was the oh yo on now no no no that was a scuba man tugging my chain yeah dude I don't know the wor oh you still got a worm on there I'm trying to think I'll do one more the worst job oh I know my worst job dude oh no there there we go it's cool worst jobs easy I had I worked for a pool company when I was 17 and I had no experience I mean obviously I was 17 I didn't know how to do anything but um  so I was working for his Pool Company and the guy just to give backstory it was in this like little kind of like not even a multiplex it was just like a driveway that opened up to a parking lot where there was like multiple businesses there yeah so apparently this guy had a pool company and it was going okay he was doing well he was making money and then he had a guy who he knew who was like not doing so well but this is like when AOL was coming out and this dude was like hey uh I'm starting a thing where like dudes can I I swear to God this is what he was like you can find women in your area like singles meetups online uhhuh so he started like just hooking dudes up like a like a Proto Tinder of like oh wow way early on like matching singles up like you know those porn ads like find horny singles and your he was doing that like in the AOL days and and then he got into like softcore pornography and all this  but this guy's pool business  tanked and then he W and he gave his gu like for five grand I'll make you a partner you can buy in I'll give you whatever like 30% of his business and the uh the guy who owned the pool company was like  that man that internet shit's weird I'm not doing it and this guy basically the other guy who had the internet thing became basically a millionaire and this guy's pool business was tanking but they were right next to each other so we would come home from like dude like we'd be like painting pools By the way  sucks cuz whenever you're in a pool it's 30 degrees hotter cuz you're painting it white so the sunlight reflecting off so you're in a pool it's 90° outside dude it felt like it was 120 degre in there so you're sweating your dick off it  blows and then we would come home from this guy his business to this dude in the parking lot in the building right next to him literally crashing gas powered remote control cars chicks and bikinis and the  like they're doing like photo shoots in there and we'd have to like go in and just like put shovels in a shed are you able to say the company I honestly don't even remember the name of it oh but it's out of business now too it wouldn't even matter oh he just made a few million and dipped oh the name of the I don't know who the guy was he was literally it was a guy in a barn so he didn't own like he didn't he didn't own like bang bus or anything oh okay he just was doing like internet marketing with adult content that's why I was wondering if it's like big I wish no dude it was if it was Bang Bus that guy should have  for real like just buried himself in one of the pools no it was just like he was just doing online marketing and making a ton of money but yeah dude that that job he would literally You' be CU like they dig pools out with machines but then to get like that like clean Edge on them you got to go by hand so it be like me and three dudes in a trench like a basically a pool just hand shoveling it out trying to get like a nice Square Edge and the dude would stand on the top of the  Edge and be like dig dig dig dig why is your shovel stopping why like the whole  time oh it was crazy dude so how long

think weed is a drug you're adorable you really are oh you are the cutest thing ever do you also think voting for president matters okay it doesn't if you want to call marijuana a drug to stop children from doing it  way on board with that absolutely but I'm 32 let me have this one have you smoked weed in your 30s it's not that fun it's not fun enough to call a drug that I know for sure to

Jin rumy all the time oh uh she talks about death with an ease that rattles my bones holy  it's creepy it's like gang members in my nana talk about death the same way like these streets going to take me out I Ain a little Mor ass  you're like all right Nana stop it stop it Nana you ever talk to anyone over 80 about death it's just facts no emotions closest I've ever came to interviewing a serial killer just sitting there like Nana what happened to Rose next door she's gone she move you're never going to find her did you kill rose like Jin oh you sneaky  just so at this game  n I'm originally from Colorado that's where I grew up and uh what okay one guy I like altitude weed's legal there that's the thing marijuana's completely yeah oh look who comes to the party  burnouts couple seconds late completely legal you can walk into a store in Colorado and buy pot with a debit card sounds great on paper like communism I hate it because I'm from there it sucks it's different for me you got to understand that I grew up there so now all of my Stoner loser friends from high school that were just supposed to  disappear now run and operate their own dispensaries they're the most successful people I know any clue how much of a mind  that is dud for the last 14 years they couldn't get jobs cuz a cloudy piss they kept failing their drug tests then with one vote they became the top experts in their field they're weed suo that's what they do now they're all experts they're like oh you should try this it's a mid-grade sativa it's it's got nodes of pineapple  you Dennis live in your mom's basement oh you're better than me now you sell government weed all right good for you what a shitty thing to do to weed weed is the goofiest thing on the planet why would you want to what's the whitest thing to do is make an old fan oh have you tried our Aspen cush I hope you ski into a tree it's just like why would you do that to weed you don't need a weed somier by the way regular SoMo are useless I'll say that Jesus I'm sorry the whole second show was all foot in the mouth wine experts it's an unnecessary thing by the way they're not even real Waiters they're not they don't take sections they're just there to judge you about not knowing anything about why they just talk  right to your face walk up to the table like what do you want to drink common mouth I don't know of course you don't this is an oldw World Mero pairs well with a nice cut of beef does it you fancy alcoholic why don't you stop swirling that glass and call your kids CU they miss you on the nose I'm getting missed birthdays thank you for laughing that children of Alcoholics I just don't like anything that's fancy for no reason there's a lot of that  it's just fancy to make you feel like garbage  dog shows that's a necessary the Westminster kennel Society it's people in suits walking dogs that's what it is but they trick you by using broadcasters with hush tones who by the way just oddly sound sexually attracted to the animals they like up next is oh that's that's a pure golden retriever he's trying to  that dog they always bring up the lineage of the animal like it's better than you cuz they know you're watching a dog show like this is Rosco a pure beagle who hails from Seven Champions no he doesn't I bet none of those dogs fought anybody most of those dogs are inbred do you know that about show dogs yeah they have to  their family like some sort of Game of Thrones plot line they're blue blood in it which hum don't do by by the way anymore we're not doing that but I guess if humans inbreed it's hillbilly but dogs do it and it's regal it kind of does sound like I'm arguing for inbreeding like if you walked into the show right now you're like what the  is this guy talking about like come on yeah want to kiss you cin maybe that's what we should do maybe we should just do a Westminster hillbilly show just have a guy in a suit with a leash and on on the other end is some fat guy in overalls just sweating doing Simple tasks just Obama's a terrorist and they're like oh is he pure Appalachian I think he's 100% Ozark check his genitals if you can't tell I clearly got high and watched one dog show I was raised by a single mom yeah sure it's my mom she like I know  it was grueling  grueling um and uh I'm an only child which is a weird relationship it's like being raised by your roommate like now I'm an adult so now my mom treats me like a friend uh who owes her money that's the relationship she's like you want to get me back for 88 about school supplies it was five single moms are like so tired all the time and when you're an only child raised by a single mom you learn pretty quickly that you're the reason she's so tired you're like oh yep all right I'll go back sorry about that you just can't be like you know simp single moms are busy like they're legitimately very busy tired people like having a conversation with a single mom is like trying to order from a restaurant that's always closing she like what what do you want what what like H ham hamburger and like yeah I know we're out man come back tomorrow what the  yeah dude you just can't you know like they're so tired there's certain luxury like I couldn't I couldn't be afraid of ghosts like that was a luxury in my house because my mom was so tired you know like like if I ever went up to my mom I was like I think there's a monster under my bed she be like I hope it just  eats you I would love a free weekend to drink wine with Linda that was a weird kid I had a ginormous head and a tiny body I had this voice I found a DVD I found a DVD of my my cousin's 7eventh birthday party that my aunt took from a tape and put it on a DVD and I watched it and my little cousin's just playing pinball and then I just Trot into the shot and I'm like when the light goes off it means you're done I'm like oh my God that's a lifelong thing what did a witch curse my mom when she was pregnant your son will have the voice of thunder in the head of a float it is like  this deep voice I would have liked it if I was alive like 70 years ago I could have been one of those groups where all I do is just go boom boom boom had some record his SE like that guy's Got Talent I'm like I had that voice as a kid for a single mom mom's just trying to catch some D on the weekend I come bumbling down the hall like nope s later dude that was a lot of effort single mom in the 80s dating that's some  effort now you can just Tinder from the couch keep swiping left until you find your kid a new dad oh is that not how that works I'm sorry that I believe in love my mom used to dat out of the classifi that's commitment a lot of young people don't even know what that is yeah there was a time before the internet there used to be a time before the before match.com when people used to fish for dick out of the back of the paper we got my stepdad out of the paper like a used Buick my mom highlighted his ad was like I'm going to check with the previous owner but Al looks pretty good so I feel bad that's what happens you grow up and you I just feel like incredibly bad that my mom was like alone just raising this  strange only child because every only child is weird you're a weird kid because you're the only kid it's just adults so you converse with adults like very maturely like uhuh and then you get around kids you're like what do you do I bite you or fight you I don't know it's all about you cuz you're the only kid adults are just like oh hi child and you feel like a fancy young Emperor where you're like I want an intendo for Christmas and I was a weird kid I talk to myself a lot did other weird  I'll admit it to you guys for two months when I was eight years old I thought I was possessed by the devil thank you for laughing at that some audiences just don't react like it's an admission of guilt like oh you were the dark lord okay I watched The Exorcism and The Omen back to back left my friend's house and I was like I'm probably the devil if I wasn't why would all those dogs bark at me every time I walk down the alley here's the shitty part I wasn't even confident about it like how much does that suck I imagine if you're the devil you're like bow down before me I was walking around like everyone's going to hate me I don't want to rule the world with evil that was like an emo devil that's what was an emo Satan I was like I'm a fallen angel couldn't even  enjoy it that summer my mom sent me to summer camp for the first time and when you don't have a lot of money and you go to summer camp it is always Church Affiliated uh which I didn't know I just showed up for the first day of camp saw a bunch of crucifixes and I was like they are going to be so mad when they find out the devil is in Cabin Six ironic booking honestly completely forgot that I might or might not be the Dark Lord completely I had such a great time I made new friends I zip lined uh I learned how to build a fire it's pretty important if you're the devil I touched a horse for the first time me and one lady everyone else apparently grew up riding  show ponies so I didn't know the show in Philly was going to be all equestrians they're like Oh look The Peasant boy touched a horse when he was it even made that horse noise when I touched its face it was like I was like oh that night they were like all right everybody it's dinner time we're going to serve Salsbury steak uh which it wasn't it was just hamburger patties covered in this mushroom sauce but I'm dumb so I was like oh Sauber steak I wonder how I how many I can fit into my giant head I ate probably good five or six and then almost immediately after I was done eating they're like all right everybody time to go outside for a prayer circle which I had never seen I wasn't raised religious so it just looked like a  up game of Red Rover but I'm a follower so I joined in I also harmonized badass I found out and what it is is it was just a bunch of little kids singing to Jesus and I was having the greatest time of my life just singing these love songs to the sky about five minutes in my stomach turned and I started sweating uncontrollably I had two thoughts at that exact moment number one that wasn't Salsberry steak number two if you throw up everyone will know that you're the devil everyone what would make the devil throw up more than young children singing love songs to Jesus I'm sitting there fighting as hard as I can at 8 years old just like don't do it don't do it don't do it and then we go to hit a high note where we're like Jesus and I just start violently projectile vomiting violently gray colorless matter you know like the devil would and I'm not throwing up like a cute eight-year-old I'm not like oh my tum tum I'm like yelling it out of my face like ah everyone is staring at me everyone at camp was staring at me and all I could hear in my head   was I'm just like I'm not the devil I'm not the devil your mother sus cocking hell dud I  left I left the next morning I went home you know that weird kid that goes home early yeah that was me uh that kid's the devil and the devil goes home early my mom picked me up immediately terrified like are you okay I was like I threw up in front of everybody she's like it's all right buddy sometimes your stomach just gets hurt and I was felt so good I was like Mom I think I'm possessed by the devil and in a way that only a very tired single mom could she just looked at me and said why would the devil want to possess you oh yeah cool good point Trish uh never thought about it like that I think we just solved one problem and have shattered that into about 700 more so I will never wear a tank top out of the house I just recently turned single better oh dude cool that was the reaction I was looking for all that steamy dick getting thrown up here nothing like some Delco dick getting winged at you just bait into it I say turn signal it's just better than saying I went through a breakup because then everyone does that  empathy where they're like you know it happened you know pain breakups are painful but sometimes necessary like the hydrated dumps is that to is that too coarse all right super painful then Super relieving that's what it is you're like no why am I going oh I think I'm going to joke I feel good feel like there's room in me I knew the I knew it was going to happen I just knew the breakup was going to happen uh she moved to LA and I live in New York which is basically like trying to  astronaut he was like there it goes all right let's go jerk off again it was my fault I'm dumb I I had a beautiful girlfriend and I let her move to LA not like let her but like you know encouraged it which is  stupid cuz you're like no it's going to work love always wins it doesn't I don't even think love makes the playoffs to be quite honest I think  love is in a rebuilding year this year going for a high draft pick I moved her out there like a   I helped her move out there you know in horror movies where the teenagers are going like to the Haunted Cabin and then there's that old man who's like I wouldn't go up that road the family was murdered there about 20 years ago no one ever comes back and then the teenagers are like  you old man and then they die cuz it's a horror film and not a porno I was helping my girlfriend move to LA and I rented a car for a week and as I'm Renning the car the guy behind the desk was this old dude he goes man there's a big suitcases for a week and I had two of her suitcases with me and I was like oh these are these are my girlfriends she's moving out here you ain't moving with her no lot of wolves man I'm like why would you say who the  are you who says that to another man I can't go back east no one wolf dicks getting thrown at my girlfriend why would you say that to me all that available attractive dick in Los Angeles and you're making me feel bad about leaving that's what it was I was just too insecure to live across the country and that's what you know I don't know what to do I asked the guy friend what I should have done that was the dumbest thing should asked a girlfriend I would have gotten nice constructive advice I asked my guy friend his immediate response was just jerk off on Skype what no why do why do I think she would want to watch that just grainy footage of me and my awkward naked body folded into a desk chair just like do you miss any of this and she's like no not at all I don't miss that at all just video of awkward breathing pattern like hold on hold on I'm almost there this such an incredibly irant thing to think that my girlfriend would want to watch 3 minutes of nothing but under dick under dick Philadelphia we're all adults we can all agree that under dick is the worst part of the penis dicks are like Bridges you only want to see them from the sides and the tops you see it and you're like that's an impressive structure then you see it from the bottom and you're like oh God it's all support banss that's a dick joke that only works in cities with  Bridges  Falls flat Omaha I tell you that now I'm back to being single that's why I need that tank top confidence smoke too much weed first off comedian are not good at being single all right we're too weird if there's a comic that's good at being single you're a  sociopath we're strange people not only that but as I said I smoke a lot of pot so I'm always just scared and hungry all the time like if a girl wants to successfully hit on me she just has to slowly approach with a handful of Trail Mix so I slowly approached all right she's like yeah Ashley he's eating out of your hand I don't know why but that reminded me I uh now I'm single and it's like you know there's guys out there that are very like I'm ready to crush some  no woman did the women don't want that if I ever met a girl that was like destroy my vagina should probably call your  dad I think there are some deep issues bubbling into the surface feel they're out of my pay grade that's what it is that's the horniness of America right now we're just the we're still number one America's number one at just being crazy horny we push sex on the people that have no business having sex like there's a commercial most of the guys have probably seen it if you watch ESPN it comes on after like the 18th Sports Center at 3: in the morning and it's this old man probably 80 85 years old talking to the camera and there's very somber music so immediately you're like oh mesophila got it this dude used to probably chew on asbest back in the 20s that's when they called it  bubblegum but this commercial this old man he's like super sad and he's talking he's like and I have a condition called Low tea for low testosterone and then they do a miracle wipe and the next picture is him shirtless and jeans on the beach with a young woman and he's just  jacked he's like super muscular but he still has his old man face he's like I'm on testosterone replacement and my sex drive has never been H they're putting our Grandpa's on steroids and no one is freaking out about this everyone's losing their  about A-Rod no one cares that our pews are on peeds you're 80 maybe you're done  maybe maybe at that age you're supposed to be eating soup and falling asleep in front of the television I don't want my grandpa walk around the house with his shirt off just like where's that Nana of yours give her this early bird special you will not you're in the middle of a game of gin rubby it just makes me think like  man I don't I don't think I'm G to have kids I don't know right why not just have a bunch of expendable income I mean all my friends are having kids all of them all my friends were procreating which sucks to be high around most of the time Stone staring at my friend's kid start thinking man you are the physical embodiment of why this friendship does not work anymore seriously you're a bummer no some of the time I'm standing around High and the kid's like I want cake like me too I I like him that's a good addition to the group it's like a lot of cake talk going on some of you guys got tense when I said I get hir on my friends kids don't freak out they love it the kids are you kidding me I'm their favorite friend because I'm a poad I'm the only one that listens to their nowhere stories yeah every sober adult ignores him I get emotionally invested just hanging on every word of some confused four-year-old running up to me like I was in the basement and I saw a monster and then I ran upstairs and I'm like but you got to wait you're okay yeah dude don't go back downstairs I knew your house was haunted I could feel it felt it felt the energy changed something brutal happened in this house little kids are creepy they just are I'm sorry I know if you have them you love them third party perspective they're so good with technology the new ones being made that does freak you out at all how just exceptional with technology have you seen a 2-year-old on an iPad it's terrifying how accurate they are most of their lives they're like put an iPad in front of him like boop boop boop boop boop boop boop boop then back of you like like  you I don't believe that I just watch you do a bank transaction  don't you Kaiser so me put the money in my overseas account and up I want to go up full of  I've been very lucky to do comedy on television very lucky and then I got luckier CU that television show took my standup and put it on YouTube so whenever I feel like having my old  I got to read YouTube comments about my standup comedy it's ah brutal it's the questions that hurt the most it's like what's this guy trying to do make you laugh this guy sucks at life that's what you to smile and it just devolves into a couple load Moes and you one guy's like this guy needs to suck a dead dog's dick for what for what making a clever observation about iPhones  you Ajax 77 and the nine people that gave you a thumbs up on this comment that's what it is man the internet's is coming through and it's  destroying everything and no one's noticing because we're just too busy in our phones it's not looking up and the internet's just just destroying it all internet broke jerking off no one noticed yeah it's gone jerking off it doesn't work like it used to before the internet back when it was underground for the internet  made it all mainstream meant more it was like Punk raw a lot of young people in here that that don't really remember that time if you're a man and you've grown up with the internet I can't trust you as a man cuz I know you've never earned a jerk earned it some of the more established seasoned gentlemen in this room and ladies remember what it was like remember nice 90s nut go to a room alone with a magazine and climax off your thoughts like a  sorcerer it moved you and that's why it was there it was the it was the universe's reset button for us that's what jerking off used to be before the internet after you done jerking off you're always like well I'm never going to be that person again and then the internet came out and everyone just started just taching it like a labat touching a button like ah lost of sufficiency that's all I'm saying it's not as efficient now jerking off basically is the new blowing your nose know that's it's you do it before you leave the house and you're slightly less irritated porn got available too quick kids are watching porn now younger kids are watching porn I'm talking 11 12 years old that's  way too young I was 13 the first time I saw a porn it does make me sound a little bit like an  but seriously you should wait first time I saw a porn I was 13 and it scared me I was like what is this a surgery video I don't want to because that gallbladder is inflamed now kids are watching porn at 12 by the time they're 14 they're going to be like grizzled porn producers just eating their cereal like what is that double anal doesn't do it for me anymore I'm not 11 you're like all right 12 years old all I wanted to do is see a titty in motion that's it simple man simple goals just wanted to see a titty in motion I thought I didn't have a man in the house I thought that's how you became a man I thought you saw a titty in motion and you touched your dick and you're like all right now I drink coffee and I understand taxes should probably start looking for my own home real soon but it just wasn't available like that like I had to wait for a free weekend of HBO I didn't know when that was going to happen all of a sudden on Thursday the channel worked and I was like well this weekend took a turn go study the TV Guide like I was on trial for murder looking for my alibi like at Bikini Island 3:00 a.m. that's where we'll strike I sense a titty in that hour pull my sleeping bag in the living room just wait wait just start fighting sleep like I'm in some sort of jerk off boot camp how bad do you want this I want this so bad never made it never made it always fell asleep always then get woken up at 6:00 a.m. by some Screaming T evangelist just like you got the devil inside you I'm like I know show me a titty and help me out the internet came out and I just  jerked off all the time just doesn't maybe that valve you know it was a release valve that's what it's there for if you really think about it jerking off you're like that's how I come I'm like what an awful sound I'm just saying maybe you know maybe it's time we evolve maybe jerking off maybe that's in the past I don't even watch internet porn anymore gave it up instead I go online and I watch emotionally moving videos until I Cry hard I cry so  hard that's the new jerking off that's the upstairs orgasm it's easy to make your downstairs leak it's hard to make it upstairs like see how weird you guys got cuz I called it crying see you're like what the  I talking about tugging on my dick two minutes ago and you're like yeah I bring up crying you're like you monster so I don't call it crying anymore I don't I call it face coming that's what I call why not it's an orgasm for your soul every time I masturbate when I finish I'm like why did I do that I didn't need to do that after a good cry after a real good cry I'm always like there's some good in the  world I could still feel you guys are like

Bill Burr,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oedGGTLCSYo,from New York City Comedy Central presents Bill Burr all right thank you thank you very much all right nice nice to be here beautiful theater here I didn't do anything today I'm a loser man that was still when I was sitting around I was watching that show I MTV Cribs you guys know that show you don't show with this show all the rock stars and the rappers houses and all their stuff does that show make you feel like a loser kills my self-esteem I'm sitting there watching Britney Spears she's like 20 years old she's like oh my god this is my helicopter I had it spray painted pink to match my top today so cool I put some glitter part we're gonna fly up to the house I'm like 34 sitting on a futon eating macaroni and cheese like oh my God I'm a loser I'll never own a helicopter you know what I love about that show though all they're doing is showing you what not to do when you get rich seriously because none of those people are saving their money half of them all they have is One Hit album so should they really be buying all of that stuff 20 room house 17 cars he's just like dude don't you watch Behind the Music haven't you learned anything from that program you're going to be smoking crack in like six weeks save your money no they're done my type right now man if you want to know how to be rich don't look at a rapper don't look at a rock star look at a guy like Bill Gates that dude is so good at being rich it's like irritating he makes like 30 million dollars a day and look at him he dresses like he works in like a shoe store but that's why he's always gonna be rich he's not showing off trying to like buy all this flashy stuff like walking around like like an iced out laptop Medallion hanging off his neck have some fuzzy pimp hat to the side sitting in a hot tub with some you know have a in his crew just for the hell of it have you noticed a new status symbol of rich people midges I'm serious no entourage is complete now unless you have a and you know what that's good for midgets seriously because historically those people have not gotten good jobs even when they book a movie they never get to be the lead never get to be the hero they always got to play like a troll or a fairy run an album under a bridge biting on somebody's legs so I was listening to George Bush today you guys like George oh yes no I like George you know what I like about George Bush he makes me feel like I could be president too he's like the first guy like from my reading level you know like the first guy like from my math class to finally go out and do something you know what I love about George he can't say the word Terror he can he uses the word every speech he can't say Terror he goes tan he goes America will not stand for 10. anybody supports tear dear terrorist we're gonna get you what kind of President goes we're gonna get you  he's like some redneck they dragged out of a barbecue put them in a suit dog just standing on stage going we're gonna get you you should just be up there with a couple of bloodhounds going go get him move smell the shirt go get him damn that Blue's a good dog I'll tell you one thing I have realized though when you go to war man that's the one time when you really have to like appreciate rednecks though no you know why because rednecks they're like America they're like the one group of people that actually want to go to war everybody else tries to get out of it like rich people never go to war you ask a college kid if he wants to go to war he's just like um I'm taking the Sociology class and I think was like really stupid my roommate's like half afghanis that's gonna cause some static hell yeah absolutely I'm ready right now you just poured the direction buddy I'm ready to do this now they're frightening people but you got to utilize them seriously you want to scare the enemy okay and rednecks are like America's pitbulls they should just sedate those people drop them off in Afghanistan just let them run wild just be like dude just go do everything you ever dreamed of doing just go crazy have one of your friends play the banjo it'll scare the hell out of you seriously you wouldn't want to draft a guy like me I'm a comedian I'm useless I'm a coward I don't like confrontations you draft a redneck not only is that dude a psycho he'll actually save you money those guys show up to the Army like here's your M16 they're like I already got one up in the trunk you ain't never seen before buddy I went on the internet got me some of that surface-to-air stuff took it out hunting got me a moose and a duck at the same time I didn't even see the duff duck was over her I'm aiming at the Moose Ducks over her that's my peripheral over her and the shot went up the moose's ass and the shrapnel from his antler hit the duck duck came down best damn dog ever right foreign  I took the subway here this evening I hate taking the Subway because I have a very like howdy Duty kind of mug me kind of face no people tend to mess with me when I'm on the train you know so I don't look at anybody when I'm on the train I just like stare at the floor you know this is a true story one night I'm sitting there I'm staring at the floor there's like 20 other people in the middle of the train all of a sudden I hit this lady's voice at the back of the train I swear to God she's sitting there she's going she's going ow I swear to God she's like oh  and you know it's like you don't want to look when some stuff like that's happening you know you try to ignore it you're just sitting there going like settle that make it go away don't want to see the rest of that but it just keeps going she's going hey sit out so finally I gotta look I look down I swear to God man this dude has got his girl like right by the back of the neck he's going to shut the hell up shut up she's like shut up so I don't know what the hell to do you know because it's like I really want to help her out but I don't really know how to fight so what am I gonna do I'm gonna walk down the end of the train five seconds later I'm gonna be gone  so I didn't do a damn thing I didn't I just sat there I was like to hell with her she picked him it's not my problem I don't know if she's into that kind of thing but so I was watching a little bit of Oprah the other night I don't really like that show my girlfriend likes it and I want to get laid so you know no no you pick your battles you don't like about that show they always examine relationships on that show you know I realize whenever they do it on those talk shows ninety percent of the time the dude is always wrong it's unbelievable two people ninety percent of time guys always wrong he's always like this woman is always like totally innocent like I was just trying to make them some chocolate chip cookies and he didn't think there was enough chocolate chips in the cookies so he started beating me with the cookie pan it was horrible then the guy's like always the biggest more never like well what they want some cookies now I'm not saying guys aren't jerks I'm a good example of one you know what I'm saying but women can be jerks too they should balance it out like you know a group of women I'd love them to do a show on are those 24 25 year old gorgeous women who will go out and like hook up and marry like a 80 year old rich guy you ever seen them hanging out like Hugh Hefner some seven-year-old guy in his pajamas now if they were just honest about it we're like look this guy's gonna die in like seven or eight minutes and we get a bag of cash and Alexis I wouldn't have a problem with it but they always try and lie and be like no I love them for who he is it has nothing to do with the big yacht there's just something about the way he drools in his bathrobe as he pushes the checkers along it's really enjoyable he's gonna be like lady y'all humping him for his money something I could never do man if some 80 year old billionaire Rich old lady came walking down the street started like hitting on me sitting like hey there sonny you know so I grabbed my ass oh you're pretty firm what are you in the Navy or something this big lady get the hell away from me right you're old you're gross you know I'm sorry I'm sure you are unbelievable back in the 20s when you're doing the Charleston making beer in your bathtub but you were at least four decades Beyond humpable I'm sorry no how do you have sex I don't understand how do you have sex with somebody 40 50 years older than you I'll tell you the only way you can do it you know what you got to do you got to put the will on the headboard No so at any point if you lose your nerve you just can read some of the stuff that you're getting you're just sitting there like oh my God this is disgusting what is becoming me oh a house in Miami okay I can stick this out a little bit longer I guess this isn't as bad as I was thinking a second ago now I got some issues I guess I do I'm not gonna lie to you like a beautiful woman I don't trust beautiful women I just don't you know why because you know what I've noticed in my life as a man beautiful woman only around when you have stuff when your life is going on great they're all over the place but when you're broke you can't find a beautiful woman you're like under a bridge there's like trolls and ferrets running around they're just not around then the second you get some like you get a little money off they come out of a woodwork like oh my God you have some stuff can you buy me some stuff I want some stuff too then the second should go broke oh my God I left something over here next to this guy he has stuff I've always loved you  no you know what you want to solidified my issues this is what solidified it okay I was at a Yankees game one time right I'm sitting there it was like the end of the inning and Tino Martinez catches a foul ball to end the inning you know they always throw it into the crowd this is like a hundred people going Tina there's a beautiful girl sitting right in the front row of course oh my God I have these eh I could sit in front of hell what this doesn't happen to everybody so there's a hundred people asking for this stupid ball he walks right up to her does it just hands it right to her didn't flip it didn't toss it handed it right to her you know what I'd have to do in my lifetime to ever catch a fall ball first of all would have to be like the one in a million chance that the ball was actually hit way the hell up where I was sitting and like the upper upper upper deck which means the ball is going to be coming in at about 100 120 miles an hour so I got to figure out like which body part I'm gonna sacrifice to slow it down and then I gotta pounce on it curl up in the fetal position as eight guys punched me in the back of the head and I pray to God that I can hang on until security gets there and he just walks right up and just handed them all she probably didn't even know what it was like basket oh baseball oh my God let me take this home and stick it next to my other unbelievable free things that I don't appreciate shelf in my house so anywho I was taking the uh I don't know you want the greatest thing about this job is I don't have a boss that's what I love about this show I never wanted a job where I had a boss that's why he's always working like warehouses because my boss gave me a rough time I could just get on a forklift and just like drive away from them you know and I realized that was too stupid to run a business you know what I mean I just knew I was never going to be that guy in like you know in the big office big long table gone we know we in the fourth quarter we need to increase increase production okay Kathy you're using a little bit too many paper clips and we need to just kind of tone that down not single you out we're just kind of I could never do it so I realized the only thing I could ever do my greatest thing could ever do was work on one of those cubicles and I refuse to do it cubicle should be illegal man you know what a cubicle basically says it basically says like you know what we don't think you're smart enough for an office but we don't want you to look at anybody so you're gonna get in there and you're gonna shut your face and you just get in there and you're like hunched over typing away around lunch time you pop your head up like a gopher like hey Steve you want to get a sandwich I said get in there and shut your face I wish I was just asking for a sandwich or something God I hate that guy I really hate that guy it's time to go on the internet and look for a weapon  pathetic man you know what I love about the cubicle I always love the pathetic attempt to try to make the cubicle like a home you know what I mean there's always like a stuffed animal in there or like a picture of your mom with like your disappointed eyes looking back out at you like why have you accepted this since your lot in life why don't you have the balls to get up and walk out of this thing I'm telling you those people need to be rescued you ever walk by a cubicle the person in the cubicle always looks back out at you because they're starved for some sort of human contact they'll just start up a conversation like hey hey raining out I haven't seen the sky in like six days they don't let us look out the window so we go there this is a true story man I'm standing all right minding my own business all right this black guy goes again on the train right all of a sudden the door's like closed on them you know when that happens they kind of open and close it it's like they're trying to like dice you up so it's like typical New York there's like 20 people watching but nobody helps out everyone's just standing like wow I think it's going to cut his arm off so the dude's stuck in the doors the conductor comes out starts giving the guy a rough time as he's stuck in the doors he's going come on buddy let's go he's like at home people up let's go so the dude in the door starts flipping out what the hell are you yelling at me for he's like I'm stuck in the doors then he makes it racial he's like I bet you wouldn't say anything to all these crackers sitting over here it was like me and three other white dudes sitting there so he gets into with this guy he keeps coming back to that point like I bet he wouldn't say anything these crackers sitting over here and after like the third or fourth crackers sitting over here man the three white dudes trying to kind of start like looking at each other like dude should we let be getting offended at this point this is getting ridiculous I can literally feel the heat from his fingers he's going crackers sitting over here somebody should do something do you know what nobody did just sat there and took it that's what sucks about being white in that situation there's no Unity there's no brothers when it comes to white people we are not we we are just complete individuals we don't care about each other we're not it's not my brother my brother lives in Ohio I don't know that guy I'm not concerned about over here I'm concerned about from here right here here that was unbelievable I got called a cracker for like 18 stops I'll tell you that's funny though when someone gets raced with you when you're white because you're not allowed to get racial back you know what I mean so it's kind of like awkward the dude's going off the white boy you crack up you're like dude you stupid jerk no you can't get racial back because the second you get racial back when you're white then all of a sudden they like wheel out that Podium and have like that press conference you got to be like that guy standing up there going I yeah I disgraced the company I disgrace myself I just like to state that there was no air conditioning on the subway I wasn't thinking clearly I have nothing against Mexicans and went to Tijuana I had a great time please please don't do this no that's why a lot of white dudes we can get up tight in certain social situations we got to watch out for the podium no that Podium can come out of nowhere you're not even trying to say something like yeah I'm thinking of getting a shirt uh what shirt I think of the black shirt what the hell did you say I said black shirt I should have said African-American shirt I apologize please I need this position I have a mortgage please don't do this so anywho I got a computer recently that's like one of the biggest things of my life I'm really trying to get like more like you know into this whole technology thing I'm awful with computers I'm one of those guys basically every button I hit on my computer my computer has to like shut down like regroup somehow like deal with my idiocy you know what I mean then there's always like some eight-year-old I see later on laptop like breaking into the Pentagon downloading movies that haven't even been made yet and I just got a plane ticket for six bucks you just want to slam his head in the thing I'll tell you the only thing I like about my computer is I really enjoy spell check no I love it you know what I love about spell check you know would be close to getting the word right have you ever noticed that all you got to do is just get it like somewhere like within the ballpark of the word it's almost like your computer can just start guessing like gosh I don't know dinosaur you know when you're sitting there like an idiot like nah I wasn't trying to spell dinosaur so now what does your computer do it starts throwing out like every d word it can possibly think of like okay how about dictionary diary any of this stuff looking familiar are we moving towards the goal or away from it you have a spell a word so bad though your spell check has absolutely no clue what the hell you're trying to spell what do you end up getting you end up getting like a question mark you got a million dollars worth of Technology just looking back at you like just like you got me buddy which is pretty amazing because I have all the words yeah and that doesn't look like any of them I can't even make a guess that's so screwed up would you like pass out whack your head off the keyboard please tell me you're not that stupid all right that's it for me you guys have a lot of fun thank you very much God bless you thank you for coming out  thank you 
Bill Burr,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vn6MHmDo_Ck," thank you music  all right thank you thank you thank you very much thanks a lot  thank you Jesus Christ give us some free tickets everybody shows up huh he's like this guy  rocks man three tickets I like this guy alright well it's uh it's good to be here man nice to be back down here in New York I didn't do  today I didn't lose her man she sat around watching TV and all the type of stuff and I'm gonna tell you something man you know what I'm sick of pedophiles and sex offenders they're there on every channel everybody is doing something on sex offenders you know it's like dude I got it there's people out there touching kids you know but it's not everybody it's a very small portion of the population so you know take it down a few cuz you're making it  awkward out there dude you can't say hi to kids anymore I love kids I love it I like making faces at him on the airplane making them last now paranoid a sex offender making me feel like a freak you know I'm terrified of kids now remember back in the day when a kid would come walking up to you you can pat him on the head hey rusty how you doing right now that kid comes walking up and like do get that thing the  away from Syria to get away and drop I'm not around just terrified get that thing away from me all right don't need the FBI or that's a catch a predator guy to come walking out like what are you doing here sit down let's show to catch a predator man that is horrible PR for white people huh Jesus Christ can they move that show to an urban area every once in a while just pitch a couple of hour Kelly's pee get on some kids you know just balance it out a little bit it's like this every dude walking in that house got to look like me oh you're gonna  anger oh  how about it's unbelievable everybody is talking about pedophiles and all that type of stuff I don't know maybe that's moral nowadays it's like easier now because the Internet you know you know cuz back in the day he had to work for right you know you got to get an ice-cream truck let's figure out when the kids got out of school you pick a straggler you know I just go on the internet just google WWWE Road these parents are falling asleep you know you're in there that's unreal what does I say we saw a kid riding a bicycle down the street you you're never gonna see that  again you never see him playing outside him some parents just have him inside now man they just feeding him and feed them you know he's making them fatter and fatter trying to make them unfuckable  you can't get that kid in the car I'm serious pedophiles in general they're very skinny people they're gonna start chalking up their forearms it's just a theory honestly don't take this  too seriously you really think that is do you think that that's why there's I don't know rented that movie uh pride recently if you guys seen that movie let me see that it's about the first all-black swim team and the difficulties they had to go through being the first all-black swim team it makes you question how many of those white people are evil movies are they gonna make it's like it's all the way down to swimming you know I'm starting to run out of white guilt you know now let's take those movies they started off unbelievable start off with roots right white guilt was at an all-time high I could barely even watch it I'm like dude I got it my ancestors are evil okay please please turn the channel dude please turn the channel they still hitting them  during the chin this is gonna be on all week Jesus Christ early 80s it was like a football movie then like cuba gooding want to be like a scuba diver I remember that  and now it's all the way down to swimming and I gotta admit I don't think I give a  I'm not trying to be a dick but it's a recreational activity plus I've been in pools there's spent black people in the pool you know I never saw any white guy like trying to like  like prevent people secondly just like making this  up I'm I'm not being a dick here either okay just to clarify you know I just want anybody coming up to me after the show line you know I was thinking it then you  said it I'm not saying that I don't think jack  people should be loud let's put on some speedos and go for a dip I'm not saying that  I'm just saying these movies he like the characters aren't even believable like they always have to have like that though the over-the-top uninhibited white racist character you know know that guy he's a guy like he's supposed to represent all the white evil you know he's like the dude they always have like screaming during the movie trailer they'll be like they were the first all-black swim team vein in his forehead is screaming  look not even looking around you know dude it's ridiculous real racism is quiet it's subtle people look around first make sure that you know that make sure the coast this disclaimers like dude you know I'm not racist but these insert group name followed by  up conversation right that's how it broke down just some guys  will prove this I work at the bank but I'd be fired immediately please I'm just saying can you just make the  like believable you know the honest thing is those movies they're starting to give me a complex you know cuz any time they do a movie about a group of people that thinks dumb  about another group of people it's always like white dudes so it's like a white dudes the only ones who think ignorant  about other people you know no Mexican guy ever walked up to somebody from India like dude what the  is that  you fight to see I was walking around well you guys don't eat cows you bunch of bags cousin why are you wearing sandals sandals discussion back  now I'm just saying you know just balance the movies out a little bit like just have some of the evil  that black people say about white people you know what when we're not around you know like like what are some good examples you know you're hanging out we had a rough day you know what are some of the classics you don't want to smell like wet dogs right you got headlights or something like that right just just slip some of that  in there yeah a little pool wash your hand while the  brenda's make it seem a little more dude I'm just saying it's all the way down to swimming where the  do you go from there we do like ping pong they were the first all-black ping pong team they're gonna steal the paddle  you got to go out there and show the white man y'all been ping-pong no I'm not I'm not saying now oh so he's just weird bringing this  up but no I'm not saying white people aren't evil either cuz I know where you I got they'd evil in me head oh I can so I can feel it that's why I try to suppress it I tried to dress casual you know I mean I'm serious man I tried a suit on the other day I felt it coming up like  man I want to take over some  right I'm gonna start telling people what to do our little blue to late flaming on my secretary you know do not even like those movies when they make black and white people get along man even those ones seem ridiculous you know cuz it always has to be like some sort of lesson and those movies just like you know I never looked at it that way this like that never happens you know any time I've ever hung out with a black dude at no point during the evening as he like tried to like teach me how to dance you know you know that interracial Footloose moment they always have to have in those movies and I never go to his neighborhood and like try to like save a school you know how many times are you gonna make that movie you know that movie the white person goes into the projects they just have to make a difference you know they just made that movie again what that was at Hilary Swank it's like did you even need to go see it it's like let me guess she shows up and they don't accept her right and she goes home she cries to her feminine boyfriend he's wearing sweat pants and he's cooking something for some reason right and he convinces her he convinces her to give it one more chance right since she goes back down there she starts drawing out their inner beauty next scene oh they put a do-rag on her she's got  dancing and it's just embarrassing for all races all the love of God stop making that  movie through the amount of times they made that movie I would think I would know somebody white who actually did that  you know Mike knows that's what he does yeah sit around and watch SportsCenter you know he's in the projects every weekend writing his name on the blackboard my name's mr. Michael all right who threw that boots through that just annoying after a while you know and it always  works out too anytime the white person goes down there I want to make that I want to see a movie where it doesn't work out like the white dude goes down then the first day just gets the  kicked out of them just leave it all negative you can't  something nice I could get a goddamn word it there's a trade-off prescription so he's something I saw the other day I'm not seeing a long time you know what I saw I saw balls on a dog  hey remember that  dude I have not seen that since like the late 90s I still like sitting there looking like I remember that  dogs used to have balls I remember that oh thank you hit your friend look at his balls you know what everybody would laugh no but somewhere along the line it became socially acceptable to cut your dog's balls off whether there's anything wrong with them or not under the whole fear of like well we don't do it he's gonna  another dog they're gonna make more jobs what are we gonna do with all these dog I love that  what are we gonna do it's like dude they're animals just let him go I'll be fine they got fangs I got claws they'll form packs you know they'll help with the obesity problem in this country you know you come stumbling out of a cheesecake factory just like I heard of  Rock run to get SUV size and Dukes of Hazzard style right now I'm Pro dog balls I am I don't use anything wrong with it doc should be able you know  who we wants to and it's ridiculous no I want to get a dog I want to get it duck I've been dying to get a dog and immediately my girls immediately what we have to get it from getting your job you'd have to get fixed I'm like why do we have to get her fixed why yeah uh I like well you're not a veterinarian she's like when they they are you great then it's a stalemate neither one of us knows what the  we're talking about so let's not start cutting anything off the animal right so of course she's a female she's got to go out and prove me wrong goes out gets a book okay it says right here you get your dog fists he's left leg to be aggressive okay okay  just listen man except he's less likely to rip up the furniture huh yes damn thing you know I just like sweetheart when we were a kid we had a family dog all right he had his balls okay guys sure occasionally he humped your leg you know but generally speaking he just laid around he begged for food you came home he's excited but he wasn't wearing a raincoat like jerking off 15 years without incident put his balls you know no sexual harassment nothing no I think I think it's I think it's weird how like human beings we're trying to control the population animals you know like anytime the deer population gets out of control some do but literally get on TV and be like all right deer population is up to about 17 18 hundred realistically we need to get that number down about five six of them all right start the bark you got a gun  shoot one in the face I'm just sitting at home like what are they they're doing that's so bad for the environment you know we're gonna need all the  grass coming up to trees just nibbling just nibble it though the deer didn't put a hole in the ozone layer all right that's not a bunch of dogs clogging up the freeway since us right we can  all we want no one's gonna stop you get out you could have 15 kids have a sixteenth on the way no one's gonna get on TV and be like all right  do what you gotta do this guy's you can just keep banging away you can just keep banging away making one useless mediocre not gonna invent  kid after another I don't understand people like that so I don't you realize after your third loser kid you don't have the DNA to make somebody special like what are you doing are you doing you're just making more in the way people just walking around looking up at  you're trying to get down the sidewalk you know but you know that too whenever you're going to the deli there's always that guy in front of you doesn't know what he wants but kind of what kind of brother sets like dude stop making that  guy Jesus Christ that dude that dude is everywhere that's why I love old people I love old people that was what their family photos cracks me up it was right we're all proud like well we had five kids and then they are at five so I can none hit that  I don't recognize anybody in that photo he just made 30 people we're all taking a  every day that ends up in a river that's not a family photo it's an environmental disaster and you framed it  no that's my solution for global warming everybody's talking about cars and oil that doesn't matter it's just too many people you know it's 20 people doing it so says you know you want to help the environment just stop  right I'm not saying stop  but you know pull out you can still have your fun right you got to stop looking at babies like they're these cute things all right they're not they aren't they are cute but most of them just gonna grow up there's gonna end up being those  and like an SUV that doesn't pull out far enough into the intersection right now you gotta wait a whole nother light to make a left and you just sitting there losing your  screaming at your windshield with this dude didn't need to exist take there's no reason for that I don't know that's my plan they should just make babies illegals like the next like 25 30 years right that'd be great think about somebody's born three people born every second to one person dying right see if you're not making any buddies like bamps let me just died right so we just fell down some stairs somebody just tripped over a skateboard right and you know what  lanes just opening up on the highway right you know you get to work a little sooner you're in a better mood dude you get it down to like 30,000 people 32,000 people be the  right Superbowl comes around everybody can go everybody can go 22 you get to play the odds of you making it in the NFL it's ridiculous good even if you suck you can still need a block on punts you feel like a wedge breaker maybe that guy holding the first down marker you wouldn't have to recycle there's no us 30,000 people man everybody hears you could literally drive your own tank drive a tank you can throw toxic waste off the top you could shoot a bald eagle right in the head  all over my tank look people I don't read okay seriously none of my  is researched you know all the  I'm talking up here I think I'm on to something with this you know it's like I'm eliminating people but like no one has to die that's it you stop making do we're gonna end up like China they gotta go over a billion people just just jam-packed everything it's like the supper he's just standing there you can't even fall asleep oh  sign but the hand just jammed max you never think about that  just standing I'm gonna be sitting there first of all how easy is it to get away with the crime over in China you know first of all you pick somebody's pocket you don't you don't have to run away you just  weave your way back across my wallet he's right over he's right so he's got black hair he's five foot five he's pressed like it's in Reservoir Dogs he's right over there  that's what we're gonna be headed how many more strip malls can you make please to get doughnuts and people to get their nails done everybody's all excited this area's really exploding it's funny it's like no dude people are  and then they're just building more  I don't know I get my act together man I'm really yeah really the critical point my life you know I am I'm seriously I'm a  psycho man I realized this about myself that you know I'm not married you know and I'm really getting to that critical age where you know pretty soon I'm just you know I got to pick a street either I'm gonna get married you know I'm just getting up being that creepy old guys hanging out in a bar you know red chest hair hanging out of hand now seriously I don't know was what's wrong yeah I just uh I think I just stayed single too long and it's just brutal there's this critical point when you stay single too long and when your brain switches from you know like don't say that time yeah  it sit see what happens do it and once you cross that line this did the evil that just just opens up it's just you know I don't you don't I just find women that just like I think they're great I don't want this to come off like I don't come off here like I'm some woman here cuz you know I know I'm a psycho but it's just like I don't I just find him to be like relentless just every day that they just they just gotta come at you they just wake up they have an agenda and they're like these psycho robots could never run out of batteries and every day this right you got to deal with that everything with a hey I need to raise it and you literally you know every day it's like waves hitting the beach you know every day just a road and a little more your life away you know just waking up inch by inch so every day just why are you hanging out with him he drinks too much where'd you buy that that ugly throw it out so one day you just hanging out in the middle of a lagoon just floating there your baseball cards and waving to your friends back on the shore don't get me tickets I still like sports oh here she comes here she comes hey honey are you doing no I'm trying to I'm trying to learn how to how to pick my battles with my girl you know what I am you know I used to argue all the time I'm just trying to pick the battles some days they come at you you think you just got to let him go just let him go and follow him to whatever dumb  they want to do later picnic your picnic good Bank anything then other days you just got to get your hand up you just got to just create this perimeter son for them to bounce off like you can send that psycho energy in another direction buy yourself a couple of hours for freedom before they bounce off something else Harry now they're relentless they never stop and there's no reason for me stop you know why this because you can't hit him that's what it is think about that there's no physical ramifications for being an  when you're a woman do you know unless you haven't how much of a dick I would be if it was socially unacceptable to kick the  out of me dude I would be trashing everybody I saw see some big muscle-bound guy but I can't do that right every guy has a line and if I cross the line I get blasted in the face totally acceptable right but with women there's no line they can just keep coming at you do they can do stuff worthy of like a suplex and they'll just stay right next to it any of the decency to run away like light your clothes on fire they're like - yeah I did that  so proud of my work I stuck around to see reaction I invited a couple of friends to heckle you as you try to stomp it out with your bare feet oh yeah they like you your car sign your name Susan did this  yes it like now can at least put her in a headlock give her a couple of I feel bad for women that unit you never get to feel that you guys should should do it to each other you know just every once in a while just haul off and just blast one of your friends in the face you know it's good for you know I know yeah I know it hurts you know you can't feel you nose your ears are ringing but I'm telling you man it clears your head and it causes you to like evaluate yourself I swear to God any time I ever got punched in the face I was always pissed but at some point during the drive home I'd always be thinking like you know it's kind of being a dick back there you know I really think about it I probably shouldn't have said that last  you know and you mean you'd like make that adjustment it's not an  I can't believe he's just gonna actually my girl punched me in the head on Valentine's Day few years ago yeah I want to hear this story this is a great one this is how much of a dick I am that I can actually tell a girl I love her give her a card and somehow at the end of the night she still blasted me in the head you know I can't even what happened all I know is she said some  then I said some stuff then she said some more stuff and I said  I'm going for big air I said the last  and next thing you know she just came flying at me right fist balled up okay and at first she was just hitting me all in here you know which is acceptable right it's a holiday let's  keep at night you know let's keep it next right I gotta admit I was blocking most of it at first right I was doing the rope-a-dope I was leaning back pulling her head and I was leaning on her talking  but it's fire her out right and then all of a sudden she just went up top  blam it hit me right in the side of the head you know what hurt the most was not that she hit me was that after she hit me she didn't have the decency to hop back like like maybe something was gonna happen she knew nothing was gonna happen it's against the rules so not only did she get to blast me in the head she then got to do like this UFC talking  thing in my face oh brother then she started like breaking up some stuff you know of course it was all my stuff and I'm just standing at okay don't look her in the eye stand as still as you can better calm down oh that's great that's something mined from high schools that meant a lot to me evidently not to you it's funny I was doing that  I have a cop with his knee in my back but evidently you have a vagina so that makes it okay I just have to stand here and all I don't know it's gotta be me don't you know I get into too many arguments I do I got an argument this girl the other day you ever meet somebody like within the first couple of minutes of meeting them they feel like they can like sum you up just like you know what your problem is and you just have this unbelievable urge just to take their head and just mush it into whatever they're eating you know and really hold it there for a second you know like feel the panic and the back of their head it's like the air bubbles become like less and less frequent you know they have like weird thoughts like that place random violent thoughts you know like I actually had the urge that elbow an old lady in the face the other day no it's not real I swear to god man I was going I was going to get off the plane right you know the rules when you go to get off the plane it goes row by row by row right in this lady's all like ooh I'm 90 I get to cut everybody right so she starts waddling around me you know I'm competitive I start boxing up right my luggage I swear to God I did this I'm literally taking up the whole aisle and all of a sudden I just go around him she just starts waddling all around me and then I just fill my elbow like dude you're gonna take this  back come on dude you got a wide open shot you know just give her equipment she's not gonna feel it she's gonna go down and you can play it off like but I didn't do it man I got I got my body under control I come on man we can't do this  this is wrong and I thought I was in control and then she got like right about there then I fell off my foot going to we can still trip her throwing that out there all the time I do I didn't do it I didn't I didn't just you never think  like that you never just walk down the street see somebody up on a ladder I just want to go over just oh just to do it you see people like eating you know sidewalk cafe that's all I'm saying it was one of one of those moments this girl was annoying me she was eating something and I was envisioning plunging her face right into it hi this is face what happened okay she tried to say I was homophobic I think she's full of  and this is the story all right we were in a diner right we just got done eating okay it came out I was looking down at the ground and when I looked up there was like these two dudes like hardcore making out you know it's like I wasn't  ready you know what I mean it was all it was it wasn't ready it's like you know you ready Brokeback Mountain or I'm walking through the village I can get my brain prepared for what I might see butts like I wasn't  ready you know I just eat these fries my god dumb  you got to go to the gym you know it's in my own head and when I looked up these two dudes one guy the beard just going at it so the second I looked up I just went like that's all I did real quick I just then this girl was just clearing it with that homophobic yeah how my father could not know homophobic I got no hatred you know I got no hatred in that area she goes what was that all about I was just like a visual thing it's just you know she goes what are you talking about Oh put it this way the first time I ever saw a porno I was like 14 years old I had no idea what doggy style was but the second I saw it my brain was just like that is the  I want to  do that some point in my life or I convinced a woman through that quick me right my brain was like yes my dick was up everything was in agreement that this was a wonderful thing and I had no idea what it was but in the same token if at any point during that porno somebody started like kissing somebody's feet I like sucking on their toes it was just close to me but that doesn't mean I hate feet and I don't want them in my neighborhood that just means I'm not into that  just same thing with the Gators I have no hatred in my heart for gay people all right they're cool they're funny generally speaking they're neat you know I got a lot of positive things to say about him you know it moved your neighborhood the property value goes up because they make it fabulous right they can't reproduce so that I'm making more in the way people wonderful for the environment god bless them but hot fart is political correctness goal that I got a look at some  that's making my brain go like  away right I'm supposed to override that start like cheering on their relationship when you think it through it's just there  notice ridiculous you're gonna tell me some gay guys never walk down the street scene to straight people straight people just going at it and never just sound like Oh God I'd like walk it off huh you can't help but that's just how his brain is wired right he just like pudding good I'm like dick but there's no hatred in that okay alright just couldn't  explain it to this girl she's a guy yeah um  it's like not what's on the same up you see a big guy eating a sandwich right and he gets a little mustard on the side of his face right you  look away but that doesn't mean you want him to choke on the sandwich then you want to get a bunch of friends to beat the  out and free the sandwich right do whatever you put your mouth on is the most intimate thing ever right there's no middle ground it's either like yes or  that there's no middle air you know balls right you just and you just insert yourself into the situation like when you watch a porno there's there's a guy and a girl but you're not looking at the guy even though he's right there you're just looking at the girl and you're just thinking yeah that's what I would be doing to her right but if you took the girl out and there was just some guy just sitting there just dry-hump you you'd be like this  is horrific right so what I'm looking at two dudes kissing it's like a stalemate there's no place for me to insert myself into that situation it isn't horrific right does that mean I'm  up you know don't love about that joke you guys got it after like the first example yet I felt the need to give you so it's got to get my  together man that's basically it started going back to therapy again I just can't thank you I just can't do therapy I try I start telling my stories I just start  laughing and then the therapist is always looking at me like you know I'm like come on it's kind of funny right nice ah so he's trying to get me to bring the walls down so you know I finally one therapy session you know I start getting a little emotional and then all of a sudden he goes he goes okay yeah just breathe and the second my brain said what a douche and I just a meter just I just hate no just the wall just came back up again you know I don't maybe I'm just fighting it you know maybe this is who the  I am I like Corvettes you know maybe I should just be this should start making some more money you know you never think about this  I don't know how you guys how do you stay married how the  do you you do it I know you take the happy family photo it's just sitting there you know you never just think of that just some day you know just slam in the garage door in your head putting yourself in a coma for a couple of just all happy okay never done leads to say happy proud all right I don't know I like  up  man I like when crazy stuff happens I like stuff for like in sports I love watching sports like I love all that stuff like people cheating like with steroids you know I am so Pro steroids it's ridiculous I could give a  I could really give a  you know I don't know what Barry Bonds is doing but whatever he's doing I hope he keeps doing it I hope he just comes out it's like one big chest muscle with like a bat sticking out just keeps cranking him over the fence you know who gives a  you people have been cheating since the beginning since I was watching put baseball in the 70s half of them were on coke you don't think that that helps you see the ball a little better you like wired out of your mind like dude I can see every step 12th inning you're all  Hancock no I love all that stuff I like when you know people fall out of the upper deck when athletes punch people in the stands I mean that's that's just like what's entertainment for me now you know I like that Jimmy the Greek moment that happens to sports you know like once every four or five years you know that like some 50 55 year old white dude tries to explain why black people are kicking the  out of white people in practically every major sport you know and it always goes down the same way right there's always like three white dudes and the one white dude in the middle he's always like the guy with like the theory you know he's okay I know it seems these are these African American athletes yeah they seem to have this saw this quick twitch muscle fiber you know there's a slow twitch and there's on this quick twitch and the second they do says that like the other two white dudes start like sliding on a frame like they're inside get fired not be part of this highlight nice no Nanette keep that seat warm right gonna do the middle he's just like hell-bent on gettin fired you know he's just he's such like bringing up slavery never deli they were breeding the strongest man with the strongest woman in that quick-quick the literally 20 minutes later that dudes on TVs like fired right he's crying his family standing there he's got like a box of  from his desk with like an Emmy sticking out and the slope is just try to make a point no I love that I love to seeing people mess up their careers like that it's just funny to me plus I got a mitt as a white dude on some level I have to believe in that theory because it's like a white dudes that bad at basketball I can't even watch the NBA anymore man it's like every high like the white dudes like that the planking does like his nuts in his face just sitting at home like for the love of God tackle the guy Jesus Christ get out of the way you ever get tired of those two nuts flying over your head you know you're gonna be on SportsCenter just get out of the way dude I'm telling you there's got to be something to that theory I saw this show one time on runaway slaves it's one of the most amazing programs I've ever seen in my life but when you ran away as a slave you didn't run to the end of the driveway and be like  that job to start walking dude you wanna like run through whole states this dogs chasing your hurtling  you're swimming those are the first  triathletes and there was nobody helping him up there was no cooler on the side of the road like come on man  dude you are on your own is it any wonder 250 to 300 years of that  and then I'm gonna do up in gym class I come from hundreds of years an alcoholics I got like half a liver you know I mean you know what's funny to me about that stuff you can't even like you know I obviously know that that Theory's crazy but it's just like you can't even bring up how well black people do are doing in sports everybody gets all weird about it which I don't understand cuz it's like a compliment you know like feeling weird it isn't right now you know I just brought that  up I'm saying something good right I said I saw a coach get in trouble for that  like his team was like Owens six or something they just couldn't win it every week the press was just getting on him more and more and more right and the duty was just like flustered and he had like a moment of honesty they're like why can't you guys win a game you know the offense isn't getting it done you know defense yeah too slow and it's just rough tell me they gets all black guys on this team with everyone started freaking out like they had no idea what this dude was talking about it's like are you watching SportsCenter or do you see the Olympics like I love 200-meter dash right there's always there's always like like like nine black dudes and then that one token white guy and like Lane eight I'm just sitting there cone come on man one time just one time put in the bronze just do what you got to do the white dude always stays with them to like the first turn then he like  blows out what's on a flat google it where's that weight through the next Olympics he's like up in the broadcast booth his careers over is where he's like a commentator yeah it's gonna be a great race still can't feel my  toes but I'm telling you now I don't get it it's like a complan we're saying you give you fast that's a good thing right people start all freaking out you're acting like that's all we can do you saying we can't be scientists no we're not always saying is if there was a race through the microscopes you  would win we're just saying pictures that you get there first you lap pool would be flapping in the wind I get there like three minutes later all cramped up with you we're looking at bacteria now you know fresh features I don't see that woman like no I get into those arguments all the time all the time friends of mine I'll be like well how come anytime a black athlete does something they say it's an athletic move any time a white athlete does it they say it's an intelligent movement it's like whoa fair enough man it just just depends on what you're doing you know I mean it's like you know if you read a defense white or black that's an intelligent move right but if you take off from the foul line jump over nine other dudes and throw the  down those other nine guys aren't standing there like  one I think of that  around guys superhero  flapping in the way with a big s on your chest I'm telling you man hey that's the funny thing about Hitler  let me work through this idea no that's my favorite my favorite sports clip is that Jesse Owens  I just love it because their whole angle was  up but he made Hitler leave in like the third quarter right he's putting down his number one finger just  walking out of the stadium feet right there whole thing was like we are going to create these superior days it's like dude I think we accidentally already did that you sent a select group of people to the gym every day for a couple hundred years that's better that's the  dunking on us every day dude how quiet was that limo ride home with Hitler you don't say you know he was talking crazy  when they were on the way there they were all amped up dude I'm going to dominate Sieg Heil is going on then whole ride home they're just sitting there all quiet you're sitting next to an even angrier than usual adolf hitler trying to make some sort of small talk like this it just wants nice day isn't it dude I can admit man I'm fascinated with Hitler man I am just how the  that guy ever came in power cuz did he ever look like he's in a good mood in any of those clips everyone's flapping around there was nobody even in the beginning to be like dude is it me in this guy's crazy I don't think of us fast total  block you can't even have around women or nothing you know no you know what as crazy people can take over  that's what it is like regular people we honor you just never say  you ever notice a like you'd be on a bus 30 decent people one crazy dude can take over the whole bus right nobody's just sitting there everything's great then one crazy just starts screaming and the second that happens all thirty people like that everything up against them to get hepatitis their buddies freaking out like why does every just pounce on the dude I think every regular person should just have like a chloroform rag like right in their front shirt pocket and the second any crazy  happens if you're behind it it's on you you just pull it out take the guy ready jump on you time up it's at who's possibly the next Hitler across the forehead you keep an eye on right nobody it's so hard it's just hard to speak up that's the  you know like I was on a target the other day right not bragging you know know what I'm standing there with a buddy of mine right he's a bouncer he's a bouncer and this really like crazy bar so he knows like all these scumbags and it just so happens that one of them just so happens to come walking through the target so my buddy goes to wave to him like hey man how's it going and riding this guy being like I know it's gone pretty good he just launches into this tirade about like like immigrants right in the middle of target so how's it going tails go god damn Mexicans keep coming to this country take it all the  job immediately everybody in line like Oh mm he's still there I'm not looking I look the last time it's your turn to look I'm not looking at you just look this guy was going off nobody did  clued me cleared me I wasn't looking at the guy evenly people who worked at Target they just kept ringing stuff up like you three socks for a dollar that's amazing think it's gonna rain out dude it was a classic chloroform moment this guy who's doing he was old like a  Hitler open-mike you know I'm just going off he was learning how to put thoughts together right how to speak in front of groups so we should just came up through some skittles on the ground you take him out legit but nobody did  you knew there was like one guy working at Target like some crazy dude peeking out from the back like I like this guy this guy's right so he follows him out to the parking lot they jump in his El Camino now there's two of them right I don't know I mean I'm into a conspiracy theory man that's my thing you guys into that  you read that stuff I do I ain't fast food fast food I think it's like a conspiracy you know I think that's how they just keep us dumb you can't even think after a while you ever notice that  like it may be a whole day planned out eat one egg McMuffin you just on the couch yeah you don't  my dreams do this it's unbelievable healthy food you can't you can't even smell it you have a bag of apples right in front of my face like my eyes are closed I can't smell it 200 miles away oh  is it KFC well then you get a bucket of it tell you never know say I'm in Aris whenever the government  up all of a sudden like McDonald's has like a new sandwich you know you just sitting there screaming at your TV I'm gonna get pardon all these CEOs noumic  so anyways yeah so I have a lot of like I have a lot of  up thoughts man I do this is the most recent one I had you ever drive down the street and see like 30 people up on a sidewalk you just think you don't do it you just fake it that's what's like separates the psychos from the functioning psychos right psychos they just think it  it they do it look at the wipers going to make a day out of it right but it's a functioning psycho not only do you not do it you actually analyze it like man if I just leave my hand right here nobody knows who I am I move it two degrees over here I'm on the cover of Newsweek and instantly famous right right here nobody knows me just a regular jackass like hey Bill want to come to the cookout you know maybe you could bring that that potato salad was such a big hit last year one of the most horrific stage it's gonna be there you can strike up a conversation maybe hook up with the no indication even try to stop  no I had those thoughts all the time like recently my girl took me to AI street fair right you guys aren't minitor Street fair you know they closed off the box right close off the block it's like shwarma there's like  made out of buttons right people with no teeth are making keychains you know it's a typical girlfriend idea it sucks and it's gonna take all Saturday right right she's like all excited she's like swinging my arm I'm like praying for lightning some sort of scaffolding to fall down on my head you know so she comes out first place she comes up to us is this big table nothing like homemade jewelry right homemade jewelry okay it's got twigs in it macaroni it's  and he's a table of  right but she loves it right she's not gonna gonna stop me so punchy right she's like trying on the earrings do you like these do you think these are nice right I want to be like now but they were nice they'd be in a store all right there being a roof some sort of structure would be built around this this is  this is a table of   but I don't want to be a dick okay that's great you know John you know I'm gonna go eat some air okay even though we're outside I think there's more air to be had you know Tubbs I felt that I was gonna snap I literally watched by two three tables of wayne's this lady staying there with this big table and nothing but muffins right homemade muffins it's like 85 degrees out she's standing there there's big table nothing but muffins she's got this big stupid look at the muffins and they look in her face and the second I saw that  that part of my brain was just like dude what would happen if you just came up and just said hey lady are these your muffins oh yeah I just started gonna  plant like how many of these muffins could I wash before anybody did anything I mean realistically I think I could have got the whole table because even if you saw me doing that  it will take at least five to six seconds to process like the game you ate the muffin off it but just seems like a waste of pastry you know there's no security  like that this don't dude standing there he's pushing them up it's okay LM on it sorry we're gonna have to ask you to leave they just took me out so I just started thinking a horrified  up look in this lady's face as I started slamming these muffins and out of nowhere I just started laughing like a maniac I'm like slumped over this fried you know card I'm dying my car looks to me she's like what the hell you laughing at and like an idiot I actually tried to explain like she was gonna get it on some level right   and she's just looking at me like why do I go out with you but I swear to god man if I never broke eye contact the second I started hitting those things that girl wouldn't even been able to call for help I would have been in her head  thank you  thank you thank you"

powdered food plant some tukiti get a windmill right and that's all well and good but if you don't know how to fight all you're doing is gathering supplies for the toughest guy in the block right he's thinking about that what am i gonna do some dude turns me upside down starts shaking the gold coins out of my pockets i gotta get a so i'm on the road right i'm in reno great gun town so go down to that little gun store right come walking and there's some redneck there i'm like hey man i want to get a gun he's like i hear you what you looking for what you want mossberg over under 357 magnum right such rattling off all this gibberish right i don't know  i'm trying to play it off i feel like a  because i don't know anything about guns so i was like what do i do here ah hell i'll go i'm going to go with honesty i go look dude i don't know anything about guns they terrify me but i'm worried about the zombies all right dude's just like you need a you need a shotgun man it's got a good sprint it's easy to load doesn't have a lot of working parts got a good spread he kept saying that he's got a good spread i'm like what does that mean he goes well that means you ain't got to be that accurate he's got a good spread further away you are the more  you hit got a good spread in fact you got a problem over here you ain't even got to look you just turned wow that's it you ain't got a problem over here anymore anything that was even remotely a problem ain't there anymore trust me and then these people here they saw what you just did here you ain't got a problem here either 90 degrees taken care of right there one shot these people get smart flip it over wow that's it he's got a good sprint so i'm like laughing my ass off i'm like dude look i just want to shoot the guy i

know  about guns come on do me solid here girls well look you have to watch the movie guy go blah blah blah he kills three people real life man you miss you miss all the  time you miss enough times

like wait a minute i live with my girl i can't just show up with a shotgun right that's not some  you can just come home with if i found this stool on the side of the road i can come home with this look at it we could we can refinish it we can carve our initials in it we can have a good time right they just show up with a shotgun hey got it for us right one barrel for you one from me now so she kyboshes the whole thing until the other night somebody broke into our car sitting in the driveway starts  with her head right so she starts reading up on guns you know she's reading too much because now she wants to get one but she's just like well i heard you got to keep the bullets in the safe keep this dock in the garage and then what then when i run around the house and assemble it there's some dudes chasing me with an axe you know even thinking this thing through sweetheart he's running around with where's the scope it's in the living room he's in the living room no we're getting this thing i want that  thing loaded right on the bedroom wall right there i'll put that thing in my jam jam sleeves just like that there's no other point that's funny though when you talk about getting a gun you know people like they either totally forward or completely against it you know they either go nuts and start screaming right or they start throwing out those stats yeah actually you you increase your chances of getting shot by 80 percent the second you get a gun in the house really what because i'm gonna load it and shower with it like the  i know it's dangerous you get a pool in your backyard you immediately increase your odds of drowning in your backyard right you couldn't do that before now you step on a rake and you go no i'm telling you i don't buy any of that  stats are so  stupid you know not that they're stupid it's the way people apply them you already have your mind made up and then you go to imright.com and you start memorizing a bunch of  and just just throw it up at people this guy tried to get me to go scuba diving like i'm not going i don't want to get eaten by a shark he's like well actually 90 of shark attacks actually happen in shallow water it's like no  that's where the people are now it's called the beach 90 of people are frolicking along the coastline it's like there's people swimming to europe let's go to iceland you  right  i don't know but actually i actually like los angeles one of the few east coast people that likes it all my  new york friends and boston friends they come out there try to get a good slice of pizza and four in the morning they can't like just  play socks it's not like exactly where i left what's the point of traveling if it's gonna be different you're so  stupid get a burrito and go on a hike what's wrong with you you're gonna go to hawaii there's no pond hockey this place sucks  i got to admit the only thing that freaks me out about los angeles is all the plastic surgery i don't get it why do people get plastic surgery you know why can't you just admit it's over you know you had your time stop trying to look  in your 50s it's weird dude their faces yank back looking all shiny right not to mention they haven't even figured it out you know why would you get a facelift can't you look at other facelifts and realize they haven't worked all the bugs out yet right that's what you want to look like like you just lost a fight three days ago don't be a hero let somebody else go in there take the  beach you you lay back wait it out they're just lying to people i know it looks great it looks great

then you  go in don't be a goddamn hero you know look at hair plugs hair plugs don't look half bad now saw this guy the other night on tv it's like oh god i wish i did this 10 years ago it's like no you don't ten years ago when they were stapling ant legs to the top of people's heads remember that your eyes would water looking at their hairline like is that is that sewn in i see pine tar they used to put you in like a headlock hold still you like a nail gun hold still you guys would tap out after a row and a half  it i don't give a  you wish you got hair plugs 10 years ago do you wish you got polio 60 years ago what else is on your wish list sir no you don't  with your face okay i understand liposuction they screw that up you can put on a shirt right there's no shirt for your face who do they think they're fooling but they're stupid you know and then you lie to yourself i'm just gonna do it you can do this just just kind of just going to have this done no you're not you're not you're just going to wax the fender in your car then that's it the rest of it looks all shitty well maybe i just do the hood and maybe i'll do the back that's how it happens then you look like one of those real housewives we face all twisted up  idiots how do i look they're they're idiots they look like i'm in my 20s no you look weird you look  weird you still look like you're in your 50s i just can't guess what year anymore because i've never seen that year i've never seen that shiny  look it's almost like you discovered a new age between 52 and 53. yeah people there's nothing wrong with being 52 and looking 52. all right you're 52. you didn't get  yeah what would you rather be 52 and look 52 or be 52 and look like a 28 year old lizard all right that's your options at this point you know what's really really like actually uh embarrassing is that the facelift that's predominantly a white problem you notice that i've never seen a black person with a facelift ever other than like the jacksons but they're all out of their minds right because their dad made him rehearse all day and sleep in the fireplace i jamming all night get in there you bastards no hugs no kisses his face permanently twisted up from 50 years of screaming sing  it's understandable with them hey do you know why so many whities need facelifts i love that word i'm trying to bring it back i love it it's funny why you know why do you know why so many caucasians need facelifts because we don't know about lotion see that only half of you left that should have been everybody yeah but a lot of you were sitting there like well what about lotion what is this lotion you speak of and what is the magic there in just to put it out there you can use lotion on other parts of your body besides your dick yeah if you ever wondered why your dick still looks brand new but the rest of you was starting to look like an aging pirate because you need to increase the circumference of the lotion distribution all right you got skin everywhere go check yourself out the bottom of your feet look like a prehistoric riverbed that's not part of the natural aging process you dried out i'm not judging you not judging anybody i didn't know anything about lotion never used it the first 33 years of my life never used it until one night i was going out with this black girl right she was getting ready and she was just putting that  on everywhere just slathering it on i thought she had like a rash or something what are they like poison ivy what's going on with you she goes no i'm just making sure i'm not ashy i said ashy she goes dry skin i went mar i guess i freaked her out a little bit because i was like ah she's like well white people get ashy too i was like yeah you know i don't think we do yeah i've been alive for 33 years no one has ever said hey billy you're looking a little ashy i never even heard that word until you said it she's like you're an idiot stick out your arm so i stick out my arm and ever so gently she just drags her nails down this smoke starts coming up it's like pastry flakes flying off track mark she's signing her name she's like you see that she goes that's ashy your ash freak me out i'm like oh  i'm ashy i didn't know anything about it all i knew was that i always got itchy in the winter couldn't figure it out always got itchy in the window what the  do i get itchy i thought it went the bath towel was dirty that's what i thought and i would change it out and put a fresh one now i'm gonna be okay take a shower dry off  itching again god damn it i hate the winner see that that's why you gotta hang out with everybody yeah there's too much information in the world and every group of people misses a little bit white people totally missed the lotion seminar at

like it's the routine right left then the middle just why don't you just fold it in half and  eat it you know what i mean it's unreal you know that's that that's when you know you know you met the right one when you want to slap the  out of him but you don't you know you want to leave but you don't there's something about them you just can't  leave right so don't settle down till you meet one like that that's that's when you know till then you know put a condom on you know just bang as many as you can so you don't have a mid-life crisis that's what you do don't tell your mother i'm telling you any of this  either   yeah that's my uh that's that's my game plan you know i do have a dog that doesn't count for anything i've never understood that you know i love my dog but uh i've learned a lot on being a dog owner man you know any dog's a good dog unless you're a psycho you know i got a pit bull it's still a great dog unless you're a  psycho and evidently i'm a psycho because my dog has been i've just been a complete maniac over the last like six months you know i didn't realize that dogs feed off your vibes you know like if you're chilling they're chilling you know if you're sleeping they're sleeping but if you're a psycho like me and you're screaming at the ref on tv being like dude you gotta be  kidding me i didn't realize that dog was over in the corner being like yeah you gotta be  kidding me  this is  i don't know what this guy's mad at but i love this guy this guy feeds me is it the door are you mad at the door yeah i had no idea i was amping this dog up i was so selfishly in my own world i'd be like on the computer and would crash oh really really dog's over in the corner with like a chew toy i never noticed like that game seven look she was getting on her face and one day i amped her up too much had no clue and i went outside we were just walking down the street and some poor bastard comes the other way and the dog's like that's that  lunge at this guy i had a puller bag all right dude i'm sorry man i'm sorry she's never done anything like that right looking down to dog what's wrong with you dogs looking at me like huh i got that son of a  didn't i i love you you feed me i got you how the hell did you see him that far away man your ears must be better than mine it's unbelievable right then i got nervous i got nervous around my own dog i started thinking  are pitbulls really like this do they just go psycho man this is nuts right that's another bad vibe to have around your dog because they pick up on that vibe right this dude comes walking down the street and i mean he's just start thinking like oh  she gonna do it again oh  oh  dog just looks at me like oh  what oh  what him hit him runs in another guy hit a puller back jesus christ i'm sorry looking down at the dog dogs trying to chest bump me and  right dude it got so bad one day she almost she almost ate a landscaper right yeah so i'm like i got to take this thing to a trainer man so i load it up in the prius and i drive over there right yeah i have a prius go ahead judge me  i love that  if you have a prius people you know you can't win you got a truck with a big lift kit people are fine because he has a little dick all right how come it's not because he is there's a dick down to the floor maybe that's why he needs all that clearance right you know if that means you have a little dick then if i have a prius does that mean i have a huge dick right because according to my friends it means i'm a  right  anyways let me towel off here for a moment so i  take this dog down to this trainer right and i show up got the dog in the back train comes out he's got his hat on backwards he got stubble you know big large cargo pants you know all shorts on and stuff and i'm thinking this guy's a psycho right and i look at my dog my dog's like sizing him up i'm like just perfect he can handle him so the guy goes all right when you hand this dog to me make sure you got the lease totally taught like that all right don't have any slack in it i said no problem right and somehow i  up i left a little slack in it and this dog just lunged right at the dude's balls right and just barely missed him and just got a big mouth full of his big cargo shorts right and immediately he just grabbed him goes all right get out of here get out of here right but instinctively i tried to help out he just goes get the  outta here yeah i didn't realize that the only reason why the dog was acting like that was because i was there and it felt like it needed to protect me so the second i left the situation immediately just became awkward right dog was just sitting there like okay like i thought we were like together and we were like friends and you were some bad guy and all of a sudden he just drove away and i don't know how to feed myself you want to be friends yeah i come back four days later the dog's laying at the guy's feet all right he's rubbing her belly she's reaching out playing with his goatee and  he goes have a seat why don't you uh don't you uh take me through your day with this dog immediately i started getting like this first 48 vibe right like they're coming at me so i got like defensive i'm like what are you waiting i take it for a hike every morning he goes that's good that's good anything you know special happen on the hike like well you know i don't know she takes a  i pick it up it's like all right easy you play any games with her i go yeah at the end of the hike i let her i let her you know for reward for going on the hike i let her run up the stairs by herself i go go on cleo and let her run up the stairs and i count five one thousand and then i run up there and then we start wrestling put her in a headlock sweep her front legs right but a tail's wagging you know she's not growling i go that's a good thing right he's like no it's  horrible i'm like why he goes you just taught your dog to claim the house and then fight for it every  day after the hike no wonder this thing's trying to attack the mailman you know so then i got upset i'm like wait a minute dude you're telling me like i can't even play with my dog he's like no you can play with it but you got to bring that energy back down the problem is you keep amping this thing up getting that mike singletary look on his face and by the time you walk out doesn't matter if you're relaxed mentally the dog is like walking through the tunnel at the rose bowl like this is what we play for  somebody hit somebody  beth so i'm actually learning to control my temper because of a  pitbull so i don't know my girl's been bugging me lately she's ready to settle down i think i'm ready to settle down too you know i got the one i know i've been saying this  for years i haven't you know she's great only thing i don't like is she uh she's really into reality tv she watches all those dumb shows put ten  in the house somebody tries to find a wife right she watches fat people cry about fudgicals blubbering their eyes oh sometimes i don't even open the wrapper i just start eating and then i get down to the stick and i know i should stop because this made out of wood she said stay crying right along with them damn throw yourself in the river you fat  she gets so mad at me look i don't put on tv to cry i like to be entertained i love when they fall in the treadmill and go flying into the drywall it's like some modern day medieval weapon i love it all those horrific shows biggest fights we have she watches uh intervention there's another that yeah that's in do you like that oh my god it's so awesome watching a family completely fall apart what is entertaining about that when they had that classic before picture the pre-meth picture she was so beautiful she was the prom queen everybody loved her then they cut to her like laying in like a gutter i'll suck your dick i'll touch your dick i'll suck your dick no we have these huge battles you know what the matter she ever got at me was one time she was watching this show was like a poor excuse for the view and they started talking about domestic violence right for the nine millionth time this year they're talking about domestic violence just in case you know you didn't get the memo you know evidently you know just some people didn't get it it's not okay to slam your wife's head into the cupboard drawers because she didn't dry the can opener off properly you know it's gonna  rust right how do you not know not to do that  do they really have to keep talking about it it's like wife beaters watching oh  ah now i get it up so daisy sweetheart here we go there you go  so at the end of the hour they come to the logical conclusion they're like there is no reason to hit a woman there is no reason to hit a woman and i was just like really i could give you like 17 right off the top of my head you could wake me from a drunken stupor i could still give you like nine dude there's plenty of reasons to hit a woman you just don't do it but to sit there and suggest that there's no reason dude the level of ego behind that statement what are you levitating above the rest of us you're never annoying women how many times have you thought about slapping you you  guy in the head this week there you go every day you didn't do it right oh dude it drives me nuts there's no reason there's no reason really no reason how about this you marry a girl you fall in love you buy her a house you go to work every day paying off the house you come home one day she's banging the next door neighbor hands you divorce papers you got to move out sleep on a futon and still pay for that house that she's going to stay in no reason i'm not saying you should do it but there's plenty of  reasons in that arc of a story all right that was a hypothetical you want an actual story i'll give you one i'll give you one all right i  up my foot playing drums trying to get my bass drum foot as fast as uh john bonham's cause i figured that's a good thing to focus on 43 years of age never married no kids i figured this this is going to lead me to the light right this this is what i need to do so i don't know what i did i i felt like after i played for like an hour and afterwards i felt like a literally like there was some  stabbing me in the bottom of my foot right like had lightning coming out of the bottom of my foot so i did the typical guy thing like i'm not going to the hospital sleep it off be fine right next morning i wake up my foot's even worse and i gotta walk my crazy dog so i'm like i can't do it my foot's killing me so i wake up my girl go sweetheart sweetheart can you do me a favor can you do me favor can you walk the dog for me can you uh just take the shift you know i'll do your afternoon shift can you just do me this all you can do this for me and she's just like oh you know i had a late late night last night i'm tired i have a big day and i just go  it she goes what do you mean  it it's like why can't you just say no why do you always gotta like waterboard me with like a 20-minute explanation that eventually lines its way around to go  yourself just say no so i'm just limping out of the room whatever go back to bed you got a big dave right so now i'm like limping down the street i got like tourette's  goddamn  dogs walking next to me i gotta admit i got a little childish i did i got a little childish you know i was just thinking about my relationship and like this is the relationship i'm in you're just gonna do whatever the hell you wanna do right and  me fine i'm gonna do whatever hell i wanna do i feel like listening to my ipod on full blast walking around the house that's what i'm gonna do cause that's what i did turned it all the way up and i just my whole plan was just to walk by her like i didn't even know her that was it she came down the hall i just ghosted her just walked right past her just trying to piss her off and i got to tell you something work like a charm work like a charm yeah hung my coat up turned around by the time i turned around she was already yelling at me but the music was so loud not only could i not hear her it actually looked like she was singing the song that i was listening to oh it's one of the highlights of the relationship so i knew what she was saying i was like whatever i don't want to talk about it leave me alone i'm going onto the computer right so i limp over and i sit down and unbeknownst to me she's like now we're going to talk about this right now comes up and slaps the headphones off my head i got a big i got big ears it  hurt so i'm like honey leave me alone i don't want to talk about it put the headphones back on she comes right back up again pooh slaps them off a little harder this time they spin halfway around my head caveman dna starts coming up talking through my teeth honey leave me alone don't want to talk about it right put them on third time she comes up slaps them right across the room and i snap i'm like fine you want to have the fight let's  have the fight she's like we will discuss this later when you calm down oh right there i just wanted to roll her up on a yoga mat and stuff her behind the couch just leave her there until she got thirsty come on let me out of here i have a spin class you've made your point this is this is ridiculous no that's the thing really is that's the thing i hate that saying there's no reason obviously i'm not saying it hit a woman you know but saying there's no reason i think that's crazy when you say there's no reason that kills any sort of examination as to how two people ended up at that at that place you say there's no reason you cut out the build-up you just left with the act how are you going to solve it if you don't figure it out look how awkward it is in here right now i said you shouldn't hit a woman i'm just saying how come you can't ask questions you can only ask questions about what the guy did you can never ask about the woman why is that why is that what is that what is what does answer them write me what does that mean are you the idiot who got up halfway through the special during the bit and you're like walking around like i'm not  taping a special here what's wrong with you what's wrong with you  had to ignore all of that and now you're gonna like yell out and not only that yell something that makes no  sense whatsoever answer him answer him  every  special i do there's always one always right down the  middle  talking about hitting women sweetheart and i think you just added another reason jesus  christ i love this i'm not even in a relationship with her and she's  nagging me   unbelievable look i understand hitting a woman's a bad thing okay how come you can't  ask questions i just don't understand like if i get bit by a rattlesnake wouldn't you guys have some questions right how did it happen did you not see it were you  with it how did this snake get so mad it almost killed you firemen put out a fire they don't just drive away afterwards they sift through the debris how did it start here's an oily rag right look i realize i'm coming off pretty ignorant right about now i realize that let me extend an olive branch then okay i realize that there's some animal guys out there okay horrible guys you know have a rough day at the factory come home tune a casserole and just start swinging all right i'm not trying to say that those people don't exist i realize they exist they should be buried underneath the prison okay so if i can admit that ladies can you at least admit that every ass kicking doesn't just fall out of the  sky really even hockey has two minutes for instigating right they understand that some back and forth happened before that  you know you know what it is is every case is handled like that rihanna one well they just say the guy's a piece of   this guy blah blah blah jail then they never ask anything about that you know i'm not saying he should have done it but i'm just saying just say it dude in your heart of hearts what do you think was going down before that happened you think she was just sitting there going oh my god baskin robbins you want to get some ice cream   you know or do you think maybe they were having some epic end of the relationship fight and some crazy  was being said maybe she was screaming in his ears some crazy female  like oh  all your friends i don't give a  maybe that's why i sell more albums than you  right to be fair she could have just been sitting there going i need a tissue do you keep those in the glove box oh my god i'll bring my own now  that because you know what it is they never address how women argue which i think is a core of a lot of that  you know i got to tell you something man like i never knew how women argued but after 20 years of losing every significant battle in a relationship i finally figured out how they argued i'm going to tell you something i'm starting to turn this franchise around i have begun a winning tradition this is how they argue as far as i can tell all right if they're right they argue the point and they stay on point and make sure you stay on point until you're down on your knees apologizing begging for forgiveness all right no problem with that totally respect it but here's the thing if they're wrong they go rogue they go off-road they start thinking of  you're sensitive about maybe you don't get along with your dad and in their head they just start concocting this evil statement totally designed this desperate hail mary attempt to make you so  mad you just call him a  that's what it is and  trumps all the  they did to start the argument now it's not about that one there's no reason to call me a  and then that's it you're in this room now right my girl knows my big thing is my big fear in life is to be that dude who grows old you know grows old alone has like that basement apartment just screaming up at the younger couple turn it down that isn't music so i noticed that anytime she was losing a fight i don't know what she just feels like that's why you're just gonna grow old and be alone then i lose my  next thing you know i'm in the kitchen washing dishes for the ninth  time in a row this is what the argument was about i was so right what happened so if you learn anything from my ignorance tonight just know this next time you're in a battle with your beautiful woman your wife girlfriend whatever and they start out of nowhere okay you're winning and they just start saying that crazy  out of nowhere just know in that moment you've won the fight okay all right don't get mad bob and weave slip all of that  maybe because you got a little dick just let that slide stay in the pocket of the argument okay it's over the argument is over you've won just take a knee and run out the clock all right yes lean on the ropes let them punch themselves out and then in the end you throw their psychology right back at them well maybe we should discuss it later when you calm down and they won't hook up with you for a couple of days who cares who cares you rub one out rub one out like a man it's a champagne of victory that's what i've learned i finally learned to like keep my cool in my relationship happened a couple years ago right me and my girl had this big argument one day right actually you guys want to hear a story you want to hear about the time my girl punched me in the face on her birthday you want to hear that one this is what happened to me but i'm really honest the fight started like three months earlier it's like the middle of march we're just driving around now since she sees this closing store she's like oh my god i didn't know they had one of those out here we need to stop and go in there so i  it let's go in there i walk in immediately i see it's one of these stores that doesn't have any chairs i know what they're trying to do i'm gonna be standing right next to her and when she likes something i gotta buy it i don't give a  i'm not playing that i go over and i sit down underneath a mannequin got like the dress hanging in my head sir you can't sit there i don't give a  looks like i'm doing it looks like i'm doing it all right so unbeknownst to me she finds some sweater that she likes right some ridiculously priced like 400 bucks or some

i'm sure that there's going to be a table right so she starts freaking out in the back of my head i'm like i got this sweater i'm good right so the more she yells at me the funnier it becomes to me but like an  rather than laughing to myself i sort of snickered out loud right sort of giggled a couple times and she just snapped like are you laughing at me are you laughing me on my birthday and then the more she yelled the more i laughed the more i laughed the more she yelled and it was just this vicious  thing all the way up right to go she got all the way to the point she was standing at the back door going you're gonna laugh at me on my birthday  you boom slams the door runs down the stairs at that point i'm literally in the fetal position like dying laughing walking towards the bathroom then i'll start here she came back up the stairs and i'm not gonna lie to you i got a little scared for a half second no i did i was in my underwear i was feeling vulnerable she comes flying into the bathroom and the second i saw her face i knew she was gonna hit me right and i'm such an  i actually have a game plan for when a woman's gonna hit you like that's how many women i've pissed off in my lifetime i actually know what's going down this is how it is most women they're flailers all right unless they had some sort of mma training then you're on your own you're probably going to catch a few right but most of them are flailers most are right-handed so you got to guess overhand right that's the first thing you got to guess so you get down the pocket right that overhand right comes in bam you catch that wrist second the right's coming you know the left's coming bam you catch that one this is the crucial moment second you got the right the next then you got the left immediately you got to step back and you got to go like this because she's going to try to kick you right in the balls as she kicks you then you spin them around tuck your head down low because they will try to headbutt you and then you just use the weight of your torso to slowly bring them down to the floor as you whisper sweet things oh look at the tiles remember you picked those out they go so well with the wallpaper right but she tricked me she came into the bathrooms and she invented this new punch she didn't throw a right she didn't throw a left she came i think there's two fisted i called it like the defibrillator right just caught me in the shoulder and like in my appendix it's a  flam like that almost went flying back into the bathtub and i caught myself and she's all ready for me to take the bait and flip out and i didn't i just remained calm it's just like sweetheart i think you need to go to work now she didn't know what to do she was like and she just just walked out all right went down to the car drove to work i walked out in the kitchen i got some cheerios sat down and started watching sportscenter  three minutes later i was on the phone rings right pick up the phone and just hear her going hi okay things got a little crazy like a little crazy you almost split my head open in the goddamn tub i'm sorry i'm just i'm i'm passionate i'm that's what they say when

like you talk about getting a gun you know right you look at when cars first came out the stupid horn you had to crank start it you'd run over your best friend now you can start one up with a remote control from like 50 yard away right remember when airbags first came out they just had one for the driver my family oh my God oh my God why would you just save  me then eventually they got airbags for everybody week and I never go and it freaks her out she's like why don't you go to church you don't believe in God and Heaven and Hell and all that stuff why why don't you go and it's not because I don't believe in a higher power I definitely do my thing is when I go to church I can't get past the fact that I'm just listening to some  guy you ever think of that  when you go in there that's just some dude and people like no that's a special guy no it isn't it isn't ah he didn't he didn't like levitate down from the ceiling like this white light around him why would you listen to another

why you see all these four to fifty pound eight-year-olds just come waddling out of the house you can't get that kid in the car i'm serious pedophiles in general are very skinny people they gotta start chalking up their forearms they're  blowing out their back  it's just a theory people honestly don't take this too seriously does he really think that do you think that that's why there's i don't know rented that movie uh pride recently have you guys seen that movie anybody see that it's about the first all black swim team and the difficulties they had to go through being the first all-black swim team let me ask you a question how many of those white people are evil movies are they gonna make it's like it's all the way down to swimming you know i'm starting to run out of white guilt you know no it's like those movies they started off unbelievable start off with roots right white guilt was at an all-time high i could barely even watch it i'm like dude i got it my ancestors are evil okay please please turn the channel dude please turn the channel they're still hitting them turn the channel this is gonna be on all week jesus christ during the channel they're in the 80s there was like a football movie then like cuba gooding want to be like a scuba diver remember that and now it's all the way down to swimming and i gotta admit i don't think i give a you know i'm not trying to be a dick but it's a recreational activity plus i've been in pools there's been black people in the pool you know i never saw any white guy like trying to like like prevent people from getting into the pool it's like they just like making this  up i'm not i'm not being a dick here either okay just to clarify you know i just want anybody coming up to me after the show you know i was thinking it and then you  said it i'm not saying that i don't think black people should be allowed to put on some speedos and go for a dip i'm not saying that  i'm just saying these movies like the characters aren't even believable like they always have to have like that or the over-the-top uninhibited white racist character you know you know that guy he's a guy like uh he's supposed to represent all the white evil you know he's like the dude they always have like screaming during the movie trailer they'd be like they were the first all-black swim team get out of the pool he's got like a big vein in his forehead he's just screaming look not even looking around you know dude it's ridiculous real racism is quiet it's subtle people look around first make sure that you know they make sure the coast is clear there's disclaimers like dude you know i'm not racist but uh these insert group name followed by up conversation right that's how it goes down not just some guy just standing up there is me broke in the pool do you approve of this i work at the bank could i be fired immediately please i'm just saying could you just make the like believable you know the honest thing is those movies are starting to give me a complex you know cause any time they do a movie about a group of people that thinks dumb  about another group of people it's always like white dudes so it's like a white dude's the only ones who think ignorant about other people you know no mexican guy ever walked up to somebody from india like dude what the  is that is that like itchy  you what is it  white dude is the only ones walking around why you guys don't need cows give you a bunch of well then why are you wearing sandals guys wearing sandals this guy's a fat  no i'm just saying you know just balance the movies out a little bit like just have some of the evil that black people say about white people you know when we're not around you know like like well what are some good examples you know you know what i mean you're hanging out you had a rough day you know what are some of the classics you know what smell like wet dogs right you got headlights or something like that right just just slip some of that in there get out of the pool wash your hand  friend just make it seem a little more dude i'm just saying it's all the way down to swimming where the do you go from there we do like ping pong they were the first all black ping-pong team they're gonna steal the paddles denzel my daughter's not playing ping-pong you got to go out there and show the white man your beard ping-pong no i'm not i'm not saying now i know it's always just weird bringing this up but no i'm not saying white people aren't evil either because i know where you are i got that evil in me i do i can so i can feel it that's why i try to suppress it i try to dress casual you know what i mean i'm serious man i tried a suit on the other day i felt it coming up like man i want to take over some right i want to start telling people what to do i want to go pollute the lake blame it on my secretary you know dude i don't like those movies when they make black and white people get along man even those ones seem ridiculous you know because it always has to be like some sort of lesson in those movies just like you know i never looked at it that way it's like that never happens you know anytime i've ever hung out with a black dude at no point during the evening is he like trying to like teach me how to dance you know you know that interracial footloose moment they always have to have in those movies and i never go to his neighborhood and like try to like save a school you know how many times are they going to make that movie you know that movie the white person goes into the projects they just have to make a difference you know they just made that movie again what that was it hillary swank it's like did you even need to go see it it's like let me guess she shows up and they don't accept her right and she goes home she cries to her feminine boyfriend who's wearing sweatpants and he's cooking something for some reason right and he convinces her and convinces her to give it one more chance right since she goes back down there she starts drawing out their inner beauty next you know they put a do-rag on it she starts dancing and it's just embarrassing for all races involved so the love of god stopped making that movie dude the amount of times they made that movie i would think i would know somebody white who actually did that  you know that's my gay saves ghettos that's what he does you know i sit around i watch sportscenter you know he's in the projects every weekend writing his name on the blackboard my name's mr michael all right who's ruined that who's through that it's just annoying after a while you know and it always works out too anytime the white person goes down there i want to make that i want to see a movie where it doesn't work out like the white dude goes down in the first day just gets the kicked out of him you know just leaving all negative you can't  help these people you know you go down there you're trying to do something nice i couldn't get a goddamn word it's a 300 prescription so here's something i saw the other day i've not seen a long time you know what i saw i saw balls on a dog hey remember that dude i have not seen that since like the late 90s i was literally sitting there looking like i remember that dogs used to have balls i remember that i bet you pit your friend ah look at his balls you know what everybody would laugh no but somewhere along the line it became socially acceptable to cut your dog's balls off whether there's anything wrong with them or not under the whole fear of like well we don't do it he's gonna another dog they're gonna make more dogs and what are we going to do with all these dogs they're not going to have homes what are we going to do i love that what are we going to do it's like dude they're animals just let them go they'll be fine they got fangs they got claws they'll form packs you know they'll help with the obesity problem in this country you know you come stumbling out of a cheesecake factory just like i heard a rottweiler running at you you gotta run to your suv diving dukes of hazard style right no i'm pro dog balls i am i don't think there's anything wrong with it dog should be able you know who we want's doing it's ridiculous no i want to get a dog i want to get a dog i've been dying to get a dog and immediately my girls immediately while we have to get it from getting it done we have to get fixed i'm like why do we have to get them fixed well you know that's what you're supposed to do i don't know like well you're not a veterinarian she's like well neither are you great then it's a stalemate neither one of us knows what the we're talking about so let's not start cutting anything off the animal right so of course she's a female she's got to go out and prove me wrong goes out and gets a book okay see it says right here um you get your dog fists he's less like you'd be aggressive okay okay no no listen god you're such an just listen and then it says he's less likely to rip up the furniture yeah you know it's like sweetheart when we were a kid we had a family dog all right he had his balls okay yeah sure occasionally he humped your leg you know but generally speaking he just laid around he begged for food he came home he was excited but he wasn't wearing a raincoat like jerking off or something you know he lived he lived for 15 years without incident with his balls you know no sexual harassment nothing no i i think i think it's i think it's weird how like human beings are trying to control the population animals you know like any time the deer population gets out of control some dude will literally get on tv and be like all right the deer population is up to about seventeen eighteen hundred realistically we need to get that number down about five six of them all right so starting tomorrow if you got a gun  sure one in the fight i'm just sitting at home like what are they deer doing that's so bad for the environment you know they're gonna eat all the grass coming up the trees just nibbling just nibbling dude the deer didn't put a hole in the ozone layer all right that's not a bunch of dogs clogging up the freeways it's us right we can all we want no one's gonna stop you could have you could have 15 kids have a 16th on the way no one's going to get on tv and be like all right paul is still start him off you got a gun shoot him in the face do what you got to do this guy he's out of control now it's great it's great man you can just keep banging away you can just keep banging away making one useless mediocre not gonna invent kid after another  i don't understand people like that so don't you realize after your third loser kid you don't have the dna to make somebody special it's like what are you doing all you're doing you're just making more in the way people just walking around looking up at as you're trying to get down the sidewalk you know well you know that dude whenever you're going to the deli there's always that guy in front of you doesn't know what he wants what kind of what kind of bread is that it's like dude stop making that  guy jesus christ that dude that dude is everywhere that's why i love all people i love old people they always with their family photos cracks me up it was like well they're all proud like well we had five kids and then they all had five and it's like yeah none of you did i don't recognize anybody in that photo you just made 30 people who are all taking a every day that ends up in a river that's not a family photo it's an environmental disaster and you framed it  no that's my solution for global warming everybody's talking about cars and oil that doesn't matter it's just too many people you know there's too many people doing it just like you know you want to help the environment just stop right i'm not saying stop but you know pull out you can still have your fun right you got to stop looking at babies like they're these cute things all right they're not they're all right they are cute but most of them are just going to grow up there's going to end up being another  and like an suv that doesn't pull out far enough into the intersection right now you got to wait a whole nother light to make a left and you're just sitting there losing your  screaming at your windshield with this dude who didn't need to exist it's like there's no reason for that guy we've got that guy i don't know  that's my plan they should just make babies illegal for like the next like 25 30 years right that'd be great think about somebody's born three people born every second to one person dying right so if you're not making anybody it's like bam somebody just died right somebody just fell down some stairs somebody just tripped over a skateboard right and you know what lanes just opening up on the highway right you know you get to work a little sooner you're in a better mood dude you get it down to like 30 000 people 30 000 people be the all right super bowl comes around everybody can go right everybody can go 22 you get to play the odds of you making it in the nfl it's ridiculous dude even if you suck you could still either block on punts you'd be like a wedge breaker or maybe that guy holding the first down mercury yeah wouldn't have to recycle there was 30 000 people man everybody here you could literally drive your own tank you drive a tank you could throw toxic waste off the top you could shoot a bald eagle right in the head there's plenty of them plenty of them dude they're all over my tank what the am i supposed to do look people i don't read okay seriously none of my is researched you know but i know all the i'm talking up here i think i'm onto something with this you know it's like i'm eliminating people but like no one has to die that's it just stop making dude we're gonna end up like china we gotta go over a billion people just just jam-packed every day it's like the subway if he's just standing there you can't even fall asleep oh sorry about that just jam-packed you never think about that just standing i'm gonna be sitting there first of all how easy is it to get away with the crime over in china you know first of all you pick somebody's pocket you don't you don't have to run away you just weave your way back in the crowd stand over here this guy's standing like dude somebody just took my wallet dude he's right over there he's right over he's right there so he's got black hair he's five foot five he's dressed like he's in reservoir though she's right over there no that's where we're going to be headed how many more strip malls can you make places to get donuts and people to get the nails done everybody's all excited this area is really exploding please floating it's like no dude people are and then they're just building more i don't know i get my act together man i'm really uh really at a critical point my life you know i am i'm i'm serious i'm a psycho man i've realized this about myself like you know i'm not married you know i'm really getting to that critical age where you know pretty soon i'm just you know i got to pick a street either i'm gonna get married you know i'm just end up being that creepy old guy hanging out in a bar you know red chest hair hanging out yes no seriously i don't know was uh what's wrong with me i just uh i think i just stayed single too long man it's just brutal there's a critical point when you stay single too long then when your brain switches from uh you know like you know don't don't don't say that to me yeah it say it see what happens dude and once you cross that line the evil that just just opens up it's just you know i don't know you don't i just find women that just like uh i think they're great i don't want this to come off like i don't come off here like i'm some woman hater because you know i know i'm a psycho but it's just like i don't know i just find them to be like relentless just every day they just they just gotta come at you they just wake up they have an agenda and they're like these psycho robots that never run out of batteries and every day just keep  god just keep coming right you gotta deal with that every single day hey honey and you literally you know every day it's it's like waves hitting the beach you know every day just eroding a little more your life away you know just waking up inch by inch every day just why are you hanging out with him he drinks too much  where'd you find that that's ugly throw it out so one day you're just hanging out in the middle of a lagoon just floating there with your baseball cards you're waving to your friends back on the shore do give me tickets i still like sports oh here she comes here she comes hey honey how you doing no i'm trying i'm trying to learn how to pick my battles with my girl you know that's what i am you know i used to argue all the time i'm just trying to pick the battles some days they they come at you you just got to let them go you just let them go and follow them to whatever dumb  they want to do it's gonna get a picnic we'll have a picnic you bring the good thing then other days you just got to get your hand up you just got to just create this perimeter or something for them to bounce off like man you just send that psycho energy in another direction buy yourself a couple of hours for freedom before they bounce off something else they start coming back no they're relentless they never stop and there's no reason for him to stop you know why cause you can't hit him that's what it is think about that there's no physical ramifications for being an  when you're a woman do you know my children how much of a dick i would be if it was socially unacceptable to kick the out of me dude i would be trashing everybody i saw see some big muscle bomb guys i go to the gym slap his protein shake hey go yourself right but i can't do that right every guy has a line and if i cross the line i get blasted in the face totally acceptable right but with women there's no line they can just keep just keep coming at you dude they can do stuff worthy of like a suplex and they'll just stand right next to it they don't have a decency to run away you're like light your clothes on fire they're like ta-da i did that oh yeah and i was so proud of my work i stuck around to see your reaction i invited a couple of friends to heckle you should try to stomp it out with your bare feet oh yeah they'll like cue your car sign their name susan did this you're sitting like now can i at least put her in a headlock give her a couple of  now i feel bad for women that you know you never get to feel that you guys should should do it to each other you know just every once in a while just haul off and just blast one of your friends in the face you know it's good for you no i know yeah i know it hurts you know you can't feel your nose your ears are ringing but i'm telling you man it clears your head and it causes you to like evaluate yourself i swear to god anytime i ever got punched in the face i was always pissed but at some point during the drive home i'd always be thinking like you know it's kind of being a dick back there you know did i really think about it i probably shouldn't have said that last you know you'd like make that adjustment this guy is an i can't believe he's just gonna say this kind of thing actually my girl punched me in the head on valentine's day a few years ago yeah you want to hear this story this is a great one this is how much of a dick i am that i can actually tell a girl i love her give her a card and somehow at the end of the night she's still blasting me in the head you know i can't even remember what happened all i know is she said some then i said some stuff then she said some more stuff and i said it i'm going for big air i said the last and next thing you know she just came flying at me right fist balled up okay and at first she was just hitting me all in here you know which is acceptable right it's a holiday let's  keep it nice you know let's keep it nice right and i gotta admit i was blocking most of it at first right i was doing the rope-a-dope i was leaning back i was pulling her head in i was leaning on her talking trying to tire her out right and then all of a sudden she just went up top bam just hit me right in the side of the head you know what hurt the most was not that she hit me was that after she hit me she didn't have the decency to hop back like like maybe something was gonna happen she knew nothing was gonna happen it's against the rules so not only did she get to blast me in the head she then got to do like this ufc talking thing in my face she's pointing i was brutal and she started like breaking up some stuff you know of course it was all my stuff and i'm just standing there okay don't look her in the eye stand as still as you can better calm down oh that's great that's something mine from high school that meant a lot to me evidently not to you it's funny if i was doing that i'd have a cop with his knee in my back but evidently you have a vagina so that makes it okay i just have to stand here as you break all my i don't know it's got to be me it does you know i get into too many arguments i do i got to argue with this girl the other day you ever meet somebody like within the first couple of minutes of meeting them they feel like they can like sum you up just like you know what your problem is and you just have this unbelievable urge just to take their head and just mush it into whatever they're eating you know and really hold it there for a second you know like feel the panic in the back of their head is like the air bubbles become like less and less frequent you know you even have like weird thoughts like that plus random violent thoughts you know like i actually had the urge to elbow an old lady in the face the other day no it's unreal i swear to god man i was going i was going to get off a plane right you know the rules when you go to get off the plane it goes roll by row by row right and this lady's all like ooh i'm 90 i get to cut everybody right so she starts waddling around me you know i'm competitive i start boxing her up right start picking down my luggage i swear to god i did this i'm literally taking up the whole aisle and all of a sudden wow i just go around him she just starts waddling all around me and then i just feel my elbow like dude you're gonna take this man come on dude you got a wide open shot you know just give her a quick one she's not gonna feel it she's gonna go down then you can play it off like oh is she with you is that happening  but i didn't do it man i got my body under control like come on man we can't do this this is wrong and i thought i was in control and then she got like right about there then i felt my like my foot going dude we can still trip her you're still tripping man just throwing that out there all the time i do i didn't do it so we just went oh i didn't i didn't just you never think like that you never just walk down the street see somebody up on a ladder you just want to go over just just shaking it just to do it you see people like eating you know sidewalk cafe having a good time knock all this off that's all i'm saying that's all i'm saying it was just it was one of one of those moments this girl was annoying me she was eating something and i was envisioning plunging her face right into it all right this is basically what happened okay she tried to say i was homophobic i think she's full of and this is the story all right we were in a diner right we just got done eating okay it came out i was looking down at the ground and when i looked up there was like these two dudes like hardcore making out you know and it's like i wasn't ready you know what i mean it was all it was i wasn't ready it's like you know if you rent a brokeback mountain or i'm walking through the village i can get my brain prepared for what i might see but it's like i wasn't ready you know what i just eaten these fries my god you dumb  you got to go to the gym you know it's in my own head and when i looked up these two dudes one guy had a beard there's ah she's going at it so the second i looked up i just went like i just looked away that's all i did real quick i just and then this girl was just clearing him like oh my god was that where you like homophobic are you homophobic i'm going on a homophobic i got no hatred you know i got no hatred in that area she goes what was that all about i got i was it was just like a visual thing it was just you know she goes what are you talking about oh put it this way the first time i ever saw porno i was like 14 years old i had no idea what doggy style was but the second i saw it my brain was just like that is the i want to do that at some point in my life i'm gonna convince a woman to do that with me right my brain was like yes my dick was up everything was in agreement that this was a wonderful thing and i had no idea what it was but the same token if at any point during that porno somebody started like kissing somebody's feet or like sucking on their toes it was just it was just gross to me but that doesn't mean i hate feet and i don't want him in my neighborhood that just means i'm not into that it's the same thing with the gators i have no hatred in my heart for gay people all right they're cool they're funny generally speaking they're neat you know i got a lot of positive things to say about them you know they move to your neighborhood the property value goes up because they make it fabulous right they can't reproduce so they're not making more in the way people walking around looking up and yeah they're wonderful for the environment god bless them but how far does political correctness go that i got to look at some that's making my brain go like ah  look away right i'm supposed to override that start like cheering on their relationship like gravitas yeah run your fingers through his chest hair dude it's ridiculous you're gonna tell me some gay guy never walked down the street seeing two straight straight people just going at it and never just thought like oh god why would judges had to like walk it off you can't help it that's just how his brain is wired right he's just like and i'm like dick right but there's no hatred in that i can't i don't know i just couldn't  explain it to this girl she's like i get your handphobic it's like no i it was on the same level you ever see a big guy eating a sandwich right and he gets a little mustard on the side of his face right you look away but that doesn't mean you want him to choke on the sandwich and you want to get a bunch of friends to beat the out of him for eating a sandwich right dude whatever you put your mouth on is the most intimate thing ever right there's no middle ground it's either like yes or that there's no middle there you know balls right  you just and you just insert yourself into the situation like when you watch a porno there's there's a guy and a girl but you're not looking at the guy even though he's right there you're just looking at the girl and you're just thinking yeah that's what i would be doing to her right but if you took the girl out and there was just some guy just sitting there just dry humping you'd be like this is horrific right so when i'm looking at two dudes kissing it's like a stalemate there's no place for me to insert myself into that situation that isn't horrific right does that mean i'm up you know do i love about that joke you guys got it after like the first example yet i felt the need to give you 58 more so just got to get my together man that's basically it started going back to therapy again i just can't i can't i just can't do therapy i try i start telling my stories i just start  laughing and then the therapist is always looking at me like you know i'm like come on man it's kind of funny right like ah nah it's really horrific so he's trying to get me to bring the walls down so you know i finally won therapy session you know i start getting a little emotional and then all of a sudden he goes he goes okay yeah just breathe in the second my brain was like oh what a douche and i just i mean it was just i just hate him no just the wall just came back up again you know i don't maybe i'm just fighting it you know maybe this is who the i am i like corvettes you know maybe i should just be this should start making some more money you know you never think about this i don't know how you guys how do you stay married how the do you you do it i know you take the happy family photo because you're sitting there you know you never just think of that just someday you know just slam in the garage door in your head putting yourself in a coma for a couple of  just all happy okay evidently it's just a happy crowd i'm the only one who thinks this all right i don't know i like up man i like when crazy stuff happens i like stuff for like in sports i love watching sports like i love all this stuff like people cheating like with steroids you know i am so pro steroids it's ridiculous i could give a i could really give a you know i don't know what barry bonds is doing but whatever he's doing i hope he keeps doing it i hope he just comes out as like one big chest muscle with like a bat sticking out it just keeps cranking him over the fence you know who gives a dude people have been cheating since the beginning since i was watching baseball in the 70s half of them were on coke you don't think that that helped you see the ball a little better you like wired out of your mind like dude i can see every stitch the curveball i'm gonna fight it 12th inning you're all amped up this is the man  no i love all that stuff i like when you know people fall out of the upper deck when athletes punch people in the stands i mean that's just like what's entertaining for me now you know i like that jimmy the greek moment that happens in sports you know like once every four or five years you know that like some 50 55 year old white dude tries to explain why black people are kicking the out of white people in practically every major sport you know and it always goes down the same way right there's always like three white dudes and the one white dude in the middle he's always like the guy with like the theory you know he's always so you know it seems these uh these african-american athletes they are they seem to have this uh this quick twitch uh muscle five you know there's a slow twitch and there's this quick twitch and the second the dude says that like the other two white dudes start like sliding out of frame like okay this guy's getting fired and i'm not gonna be part of this highlight nice knowing your ned keep that seat warm right  and the dude in the middle he's just like hell bent on getting fired you know he's just he starts like bringing up slavery and evidently they're reading the strongest man with the strongest woman in that quick twitch and then literally 20 minutes later that dude's on tv he's like fired right he's crying his family's standing there he's got like a box of from his desk with like an emmy sticking out he's like i don't know what i said i was just talking about the quick twitch and the slow twitch was wasn't just trying to make a point no i love that i love seeing people mess up their careers like that it's just funny to me plus i gotta admit as a white dude on some level i have to believe in that theory because it's like a white dude's that bad at basketball i can't even watch the nba anymore man it's like every highlight the white dude's like that the black cube does like his nuts in his face i'm just sitting at home like for the love of god tackle the god jesus christ get out of the way do you ever get tired of those two nuts flying over your head you know you're gonna be on sportscenter just get out of the way dude i'm telling you there's got to be something to that theory i saw this show one time on runaway slaves it's one of the most amazing programs i've ever seen in my life so when you ran away as a slave you just didn't run to the end of the driveway and be like ah that job just start walking down the street dude you want to like run through whole states there's dogs chasing you you're hurtling  you're swimming those were the first triathletes and there was nobody helping him out there was no dude on the side of the road like come on man two more statesmen ohio check it out you looking good looking good yeah you dude you were on your own is it any wonder 250 300 years of that and then i'm gonna d you up in gym class and it happened i come from hundreds of years of alcoholics i got like half a liver you know what i mean it's just you know what's funny to me about that stuff you can't even like you know i obviously know that theory is crazy but it's just like you can't even bring up how well black people are doing in sports everybody gets all weird about it which i don't understand because it's like a compliment you know like feel how weird it is right now you know i just brought that up i'm saying something good right i said i saw a coach get in trouble for that like his team was like oh and six or something they just couldn't win and every week the press was just getting on him more and more and more right and the dude he was just like flustered and he had like a moment of honesty they were like why can't you guys win a game he's like oh you know oh the offense isn't getting it done you know defense you know too slow and i just run out tell him we gotta get some more black guys in this team but i'm sorry and immediately everybody's like why why everyone started freaking out like they had no idea what this dude was talking about it's like are you watching sportscenter or do you see the olympics like i love the 100 meter dash right there's always there's always like like like nine black dudes and that one token white guy in like lane eight i'm just sitting there going come on man one time just one time just win the bronze just do what you got to do the white dude always stays with him till like the first turn then he like  blows out his family those other eight black dudes left where's that white dude the next olympics he's like up in the broadcast booth his career is over this is where he's like a commentator yeah it's gonna be a great race still can't feel my  toes but i'm telling you no i don't get it it's like a compliment we're saying you you're fast that's a good thing right people start all freaking out you're acting like that's all we can do you're saying we can't be scientists no we're not all we're saying is if there was a race through the microscopes you would win we're just saying that you're fast you get there first your lab coat would be flapping in the wind i get there like three minutes later all cramped up or you're looking at bacteria no you go first you just go for it jesus christ there's a bubble a guy ran by a volvo and street shoes i've never seen that before my life no i get into those arguments all the time all the time friends of mine will be like well how come any time a black athlete does something they say it's an athletic move anytime a white athlete does it they say it's an intelligent move and it's like well fair enough man it just just depends on what you're doing you know what i mean it's like you know if you read a defense white or black that's an intelligent move right but if you take off from the foul line jump over nine other dudes and throw the down those other nine guys aren't standing there like why don't i think of that here i am dribbling around guys i said that's some superhero she had like a cake flapping in the wind with a big s on your chest i'm telling you man that's the funny thing about hitler  just let me finish let me work my way let me work my way through this idea no that's my favorite my favorite sports clip is that jesse owens i just love it because their whole angle was up and he made hitler leave in like the third quarter right he's putting down his number one finger just walking out of the stadium jesus christ their whole thing was like we are going to create a superior race it's like dude i think we accidentally already did that and we sent a select group of people to the gym every day for a couple hundred years that's pretty evidence they're  dunking on us every day dude how quiet was that limo ride home with hitler you know what i'm saying you know he was talking crazy when they were on the way there they were all amped up they're going to dominate sig hi hell what's going on that whole ride home they're just sitting there all quiet you're sitting next to an even angrier than usual adolf hitler trying to make some sort of small talk like it is one nice day isn't it you know it's a nice boot dude i gotta admit man i'm fascinated with hitler man i am just how the that guy ever came in power because does he ever look like he's in a good mood in any of those clips everyone's just ah  hair's flapping around there was nobody even in the beginning to be like dude is it me and this guy's this guy's going crazy kind of a spaz total block you can't even have them around women or nothing you know no you notice crazy people can take over  that's what it is like regular people i don't know you just never say you ever notice that like you'd be on a bus 30 decent people one crazy dude can take over the whole bus right everybody's just sitting there everything's great then one crazy ah  i just start screaming the second that happens all 30 people like oh my god he was like up against him he's got hepatitis everybody's freaking out it's like why does harry just pounce on the duke i think every regular person should just have like a chloroform rag like right in their front shirt pocket and the second any crazy happens if you're behind it it's on you you just pull it out and take the guys down everybody jumps on you tie him up and you tattoo possibly the next hitler across his forehead you keep an eye on him right  nobody it's so hard it's just hard to speak up that's the  you know like i was going to target the other day right not bragging you know i what i'm standing there with the buddy of mine right he's a bouncer he's a bouncer in this really like crazy bar so he knows like all these scumbags and it just so happens that one of them just so happens to come walking through the target so my buddy goes to wave to him like hey man how's it going and riding this guy being like oh you know it's going pretty good he just launches into this tirade about like like immigrants right in the middle of target he's like how's it going tell you how it's going it's goddamn mexicans keep coming to this country taking all the jobs immediately everybody in line like eminem let's be the back of these for a while wow look at that glucose is he still there i'm not looking i looked the last time it's your turn to look i am not looking you just look this guy was going off nobody did include me including me i wasn't looking at the guy even the people who worked at target they just kept ringing stuff up like ooh three socks for a dollar that's amazing i think it's gonna rain out dude it was a classic chloroform moment this guy was doing he was doing like a  hitler open mic you know he was just going off he was learning how to put thoughts together right how to speak in front of groups somebody should just came out you know threw some skittles on the ground you take them out that's it it's over but nobody did you knew there was like one guy working at target like some crazy dude peeking out from the back like i like this guy this guy's making a lot of sense right so he follows him out to the parking lot they jump in his el camino now there's two of them right i don't know i'm into uh conspiracy theory man that's my thing you guys into that you read that stuff i do i think fast food fast food i think is like a conspiracy you know i think that's how they just keep us dumb you can't even think after a while you haven't noticed that like if you have your whole day planned out eat one egg mcmuffin you just on the couch yeah you know what my dreams  dude it's unbelievable healthy food you can't you can't even smell it you have a bag of apples right in front of my face like my eyes are closed i can't smell it 200 miles away oh is that is that kfc you wanna get some chicken well then you get a bucket of it i'll tell you never notice that you've noticed whenever the government up all of a sudden like mcdonald's has like a new sandwich you know you're just sitting there screaming at your tv how can i get pardon all these ceos new mcrib i'm gonna try this shove it down your face  so anyways yeah so i have a lot of like uh have a lot of up thoughts man i do this is the most recent one i had you ever drive down the street and see like 30 people up on the sidewalk and you just think right you don't do it you just think it that's what's like separates the psychos from the functioning psychos right psychos they just thinking it they do it they get the wipers going they make a day out of it right but as a functioning psycho not only do you not do it you actually analyze it like man if i just leave my hand right here nobody knows who i am i move it two degrees over here i'm on the cover of newsweek i am instantly famous right right here nobody knows me just a regular jackass like hey bill you want to come to the cookout you know maybe you could bring that that potato salad it was such a big hit last year one of the most terrific stains we've seen in here bottles just screwed up you should really go there amy's gonna be there you could strike up the conversation maybe hook up with the no indication he even tried to stop  no i have those thoughts all the time like recently my girl took me to a street fair right you guys ever remember the street fair you know they closed off the block right he closed off the block there's like shawarma there's like made out of buttons right people with no teeth are making key chains you know it's a typical girlfriend idea it sucks and it's going to take all saturday right right she's like all excited she's like swinging my arm oh my god this is going to be gay right i'm like praying for lightning some sort of scaffolding to fall down on my head you know so she comes up first place she comes up to is this big table nothing but like homemade jewelry right homemade jewelry okay it's got twigs in it macaroni it's it is a table of right but she loves it right she's like oh my goodness that's so funky right she's like trying on the earrings do you like these do you think these are nice right i want to be like no if they were nice they'd be in a store all right there'd be a roof some sort of structure would be built around this this is this is a table of right  but i don't want to be a dick so i'm like no honey that's great you know what john you know i'm going to go get some air okay even though we're outside i think there's more air to be had you know enough cause i felt it i was gonna snap i literally watched like two three tables of williams this lady standing there with this big table and nothing but muffins right homemade muffins like 85 degrees out she's standing there this big table nothing but muffins she's got this big stupid look at the muffins they made look at her face and the second i saw that that part of my brain was just like dude what would happen if you just came up and just said hey lady are these your muffins oh yeah i just started going like how many of these muffins could i mush before anybody did anything i mean realistically i think i could have got the whole table because even if you saw me doing that  it would take at least five to six seconds to process like did they say you can do that is it like a game do you eat the muffin off your fist that just seems like a waste of pastry you know dude there's no security and  like that there's no dude standing there he's mushing the muffins okay i'm on it sir we're gonna have to ask you to leave they just choked me out so i just started thinking of the horrified up look in this lady's face as i started slamming these muffins and out of nowhere i just started laughing like a maniac i'm like slumped over this fried dough card i'm dying my girl looks at me she's like what the hell are you laughing at and like an idiot i actually tried to explain her like she was gonna get it on some level right i'm just sitting there like i was just thinking what if i started punching the muffins you know what i mean i just started punching him and she's just looking at me like why do i go out with you dude but i swear to god man if i never broke eye contact the second i started hitting those things that girl wouldn't even be able to call for help i would have been in her head it would have been too personal she'd be like did i go to high school with this guy why would you do that puppets are a happy food i don't understand it all right listen i'm out of time you guys are so much fun thank you so much for coming out i really appreciate it thank you thank you very much thank you thank you

what I was doing I was watching this uh you know those fabulous lives I was watching the uh The Fabulous Life of the Olsen twins you know they're like 18 years old they're like zillionaires we got a great apartment and it's making me feel like a loser then halfway through it I find out one of them's anorexic I was like you know what all right it makes me feel better you know I'm glad she's not eating hope you pass out whack your head off your golden sink just to add to my day you know I don't get I don't get how the other Olsen twin only weighs half a pound more but she's  fine no they're so starving they're weak that's why whenever they take a picture of him you haven't noticed they gotta like  lean them up against each other so like they don't tip over like they're like still trying to look sexy let's see they look like aliens they are man you can't wait 42 pounds and have your eyeballs be 28 of that weight and not look like you're from outer space like when I look at them I think if E.T was going to have a threesome those are the two  he'd hook up with let me get that glowing finger going now I feel like a loser man I'm  36 I'm not married you know I'm at that age where everybody I know is getting married you know let me ask you a question why the hell would people keep getting married you know isn't anybody looking at the stats I mean what's it like one out of two marriages goes right down the  people if you were going skydiving and they told you half the parachutes were gonna open you'd be like yo  that I'm not going man now it's like I don't like those odds I get a 50 chance of splatting on the ground I'm not doing it right but there's something about getting married people just have to do it they're just like is this the line to lose half my  awesome this is gonna be great I can't wait to lose my car my money oh walk the line's moving one step closer to my own personal health thank you no I don't think I could ever get married man married dudes freaked me out anytime you ask a married Guy what's it like being married they always tell you it's good but they always have a look on their face like they have like an appendicitis do you have another set be like dude what's it like being married like you know it's good it's good it's uh didn't work but uh you know I think when you meet that special someone the connection and I can't fill my life let me just just lean over here you know a woman completes a man and some other metaphor no you know what freaks me out too really when you go into a man's house there's nothing in there a married guy's house when you walk in there there's nothing in there that even suggests a man even lives there it's all potpourri and throw pillows that stupid canopy we live in a dollhouse  over the bed  where does all the guys stuff go they just throw it out they just walk into your apartment oh my God look at all your stuff all your stuff is stupid look at all this stupid stuff wow guys buy really stupid stuff hey you want to go to the candle store let's go to the candle store wouldn't that be awesome I've been dragged into that nightmare for like an hour and a half 90 minutes just sitting there this one smells like a pumpkin and that's not like a pumpkin this is like a Christmas tree wouldn't that be great it's not like Christmas in the apartment middle of summer just  with your whole reality  no you know what it is I didn't have a really good model necessarily like growing up like watching my parents they always used to argue and  you know like I was afraid of my dad when I was growing up you know anybody have a dad like that you're just afraid of them you know not like those sitcom dads they come home the kids are like hugging their legs my dad pulls in the driveway you mean my brothers freaks like  dad's home shut off the TV try to hide dude if I stand like this do I look like a lamp he won't see me right can I just  chill out here  wasn't understanding don't be told you you didn't sit down while we're gonna work it out we'll just you know I still love you yo what the  is wrong with you he says Christ you're an idiot which even paying attention  Christ you're just like your mother you're  out to lunch that was my dad no matter what he was bitching about somehow he would make it about my mother would have nothing to do nothing to do with her he could somehow find a connection and spin it back even said I was it raining out oh for Christ's sake I don't need this  Christ it's the same goddamn thing with your mother that woman is a  Cloud hanging over my life anytime you got an idea why she shits all over it  no he was hilarious he used to work all the time so you didn't really have like any friends or anything so you should talk to me when I was eight years old like I was a  bartender just dumping all this  on me like playing in the sandbox he'd be coming up the Ontario and I don't know what the  I ever got married for I'll tell you man I'm gonna get the  out I swear to God one of these days I'm getting the car I'm gonna  drive out of here your mother's a  Billy do you realize that the woman is a   is that too real for you guys you  know what I'm talking about uh-huh I I will get married you know I was making that I'll definitely get married someday you know I don't you know I love women and everything I'm just fine and I'm not like compatible with them you know what I mean if they just feel that like women have like too much energy for me you know what I mean like you can't have a day off when you have a girlfriend you ever notice that it's almost like they see that open day they're like oh my god let's go fill it up with  no then they just come at you with one horrible idea after another horrible ideas like you want to make some sandwiches and go to the park you want to go to The Container Store get some containers for your t-shirts this is the worst one let me get this one want to go to brunch you want to go to brunch on Sunday and inside you're like  no you can't say that right you gotta keep them happy so what do you do you agree like yeah let's go to brunch what a great idea why would you want to sleep in on a Sunday when you can go pay 18 for eggs nah you're thinking now you take it then we can sit around to listen to your friends have moronic conversations about the eggs like is that pesto is that pesto in your omelette oh it's asparagus it's asparagus I thought it was that show oh you just want to flip the whole  table over it's horrendous I'm trying to learn to pick my battles when I date girls I usually argue with women all the time man I'm stupid like that you know like I did to this girl one time she was like really into like women's issues so we used to always have these dumb ass arguments like one time she came up to me she goes okay explain this to me but why does a guy make more an hour to do the exact same job huh I go I'll tell you why because in the unlikely event that we're both on a Titanic and it starts to sink for some  up reason you get to leave with the kids and I have to stay  yeah that's why I get the dollar more now well think about it if there's a house fire it's always Women and Children First I gotta stand there with like the back of my shirt on fire going Let's go people let's go let's go  so that's how I look at it no it's a dollar an hour surcharge that if something  up happens either I can't leave or I gotta like get in the way of it to give you a head start like rabbit dog run honey One Mississippi two Mississippi you hear a bump in the night I gotta go check it out like yes he does have a knife  anytime there's a hostage situation who do they negotiate for first well at least let the women and children go what about me bullets hurt me too why the  do I gotta stay in the vault no that's my point man where are all the feminists in those situations you don't mean you can't find them they are no feminists in a house fire that's a guarantee you can take the most hardcore feminine some chick right in your face like he's shoving his dick down a  little short little haircut the whole nine yards right second those Flames break out she's gonna twist those little hairs into pigtails ooh I'm just a girl I wanna go play jump rope and leave you standing in a burning house like you're not flammable you know but I'm not I'm not a dick though I'm not I'm not saying I think a woman should make a doll less an hour to do the same job all I'm saying is we're gonna make what I make when the boat sinks you better be standing right there next to me listen to that guy Play The Cello then you get the corner office you get all the benefits or whatever so anyways I was watching uh George Bush today man that guy scares the  on me no not because like all you know all that political stuff he's just like tuning to Jesus for me I get uncomfortable with that when people get like overly religious it kind of freaks me out you know what I mean like like I don't mind I don't mind when like black people get really into Jesus though you know because like somehow like to  stay spiritual you know you get a couple of good songs out of it you know what I mean people look like they're having a good time somehow when like white dudes get 200 Jesus all of a sudden like  catches on fire people start dying somebody says they're Jesus and they try to  every chick in the compound then the FBI's got the place surrounded that tank comes in shooting the Flames out the front and white dudes and any more crazier than black dudes it's just that nobody's watching us that's the problem that's too much freedom it's kind of like living alone you know that same kind of  up freedom never feel when you live alone you like slowly go crazy you know because you got too much freedom because everybody does crazy  when you live alone and start doing something crazy there's nobody there to be like dude what the  are you doing what what is wrong with you what is that put it down my girls actually she's really like religious she goes to church every week and I never go and it freaks her out she's like why don't you go to church you don't believe in God in heaven and hell and all that stuff why don't you go and it's not because I don't believe in a higher power I definitely do my thing is when I go to church I can't get past the fact that I'm just listening to some  guy you ever think of that  when you go in there that's just some dude and people like no that's a special guy no it isn't it it isn't it ah he didn't he didn't like levitate down from the ceiling like this white light around him why would you listen to another human being tell you where you're gonna go when you die it's just like dude have you ever been dead no great so wouldn't it be safe to assume that you wouldn't have the slightest  idea what you're talking about you're making it up you're making the  up you're not fooling me with the robes and the candles speaking in Old English he said it done to you shut the  up you don't talk like that it's just some guy your name's Jerry you played soccer you got your ass kicked in gym class and how you doing this  I can't do it I just I can't get past that fact I'm sitting in church this guy's name's  cliff he's  born and just break the guy down and then I can't listen it's like you go and they used to do another human being tell you what to eat and when to eat it don't eat meat this Friday do you eat meat this Friday you are going to hell it's like dude I'm going to a cookout on Friday if you eat that  cheeseburger buddy that is it for you who is this guy dude I'll eat a cheeseburger whenever I want to and I'll jerk off it's my dick why am I listening to this guy  jerk off while I eat a cheeseburger what do you think about that not hurting anybody why would God care I'm not hurting anybody think about it you eat a cheeseburger that's Protein that's good for your muscles right and I don't know about you guys but after I rub one out I'm all relaxed unless likely to lash out at my fellow man I'm in a great space mentally I don't have any road rage I taught to telemarketers I'm buying the  I think they just they just make it all up but it's weird though because I'm kind of feeling this thing because I'm in church a while I'm kind of feeling like you know I want to go back but I need a new religion man that's why I'm kind of between religions right now you know like I used to be Catholic but you know I can't be Catholic anymore you know I mean once they started  the kids I was just like all right dude you know what I'm out okay you guys party way too  hard I got off at about 22 exits ago I didn't see that page in the book I don't know what you guys are doing I can't believe they're still in business people are still showing up name one other business that could survive that  because they were  kids at Walmart they could sell rakes the next day just try to play it off like yeah we hit a little prom in aisle 8 but you know we got some slacks over here we've got kitchen appliances we got some hula hoops you guys saw the pope die she saw that right yeah everyone's flipping out man I thought that was a good thing I was like happy for him man he was in horrible health you know what I mean everybody just wanted a guy to keep hanging on it's ridiculous they're like Wheeling them from room to room and people are still flipping okay I think he's gonna die I think he's gonna die himself it's like well I think he's gonna go to heaven I mean it's got to be better than that  I bet the last too much of his life he was just sitting in that chair going God I wish the world would stop praying for me  let me go good Lord I skied till I was 78 I had a great life move on so I got a new pope now they picked another old white dude you know and uh they were actually in the running was this black dude from Nigeria right they actually considering making him the pope and I was kind of hoping he was going to win you know not because I give a  either way I just want to see all the black Comics doing bits like the next day like oh why people scared now what people is dead now yeah the pope is black and  it's gonna be a whole different story he's gonna come in with the hat to decide who's just gonna be pumping white people in the front road yeah I don't know what the  going on because when black people go to church could you just feel it that was like a half hour material went out the  window the second they picked another white dude it was endless Paul Mobile's gonna be pimped out and you better not be shooting at this Pope the black pope will be shooting back at your hat because when white people get shot etc etc actually I have this black dude moved in my building man lives on the same floor as me he's one of these dudes every time he's hilarious every time he says some  right after he's done saying the  he repeats like the most important part of like the previous sentence it's hilarious everything he said will be like yo my man came in he put that  on the table put it on the table it's hilarious everything he says yo this country's at War son wow I'm just looking at my friend like dude did you hear him the first time because I heard him the first time I was smiling I was nodding am I supposed my  supposed to do that I mean what am I supposed to do  actually I got a couple of uh friends of uh African persuasion and uh I gotta get rid of him man I gotta admit to you I'm fine I'm spending too much money on clothes hanging out with him because I gotta like  try to keep up with their wardrobe it's like every time they go out they got all brand new  on all brand new  so when I show up with my white version of brand new which is you know I basically I iron the  right I ironed it right it's still they just start trashing me I can't keep up with them man they got like  58 pairs of sneakers never noticed that  like every color  Timberland I don't give a  what  up color their shirt is they got a pair of shoes to match it and a hat it's like a rule or something they're the worst even when you wear some new  there's like some sort of rule that you gotta like space out the amount of time with within which like that you wear it because God forbid you wear the same shirt within a 10-day period one of them's gonna notice all of a sudden just look at you finding like this motherfucker's got the same  he had on last Tuesday and then the whole car is like oh  that everybody just stops making fun of you  close first they do the math like what was that five days ago five days this  got five shirts got five shirts they start breaking it down yo it's for sure if you say Monday next shift we say Tuesday during the weekend he ain't been wearing no shirt I'll tell you that's actually funny you know what that's actually how uh how I judge black guys now when I first came to the city like all black people scared me no it's like the typical white dude from like the suburbs you know what I mean had no frame of reference you know it's my only frame of reference with black people's like those remember those early 90s gangster rap videos throw the  LA riots in there man it's  horrible PR oud I'm watching the video so he's got nice car he's got all the women and he's still  mad dudes are never happy but after 10 years of living in the sea this is how I narrow it down well a black dude scares me now black dudes with dirty sneakers scare the   out of me  the last  that they're gonna let go the immediate  that they have on so I think you know if his sneakers are  up that means his life is  up every time he leaves his building the whole neighborhood oh  everyone sucks making fun of them he's on the train in a bad mood I kind of have this howdy Duty kind of mug me kind of face I'm not saying something's gonna happen I'm just saying I'm paying attention so I've been seeing this girl recently uh it's black girl right she lives up in Harlem you know gone out like three four times you know first time we hung out we hung out like the Village area in New York you know which is sort of like a racially mixed area so  was cool you know what I mean second time we hung out was more like Midtown you know then the third time she called me at like 3 30 in the morning and she wanted me to come up to her apartment right so it's 3 30 in the morning she lives in Harlem I look how I look so it's a  situation yeah cause you know the deal right basically a white dude feels comfortable up to about like 98th 99th Street you know what I'm saying the second the streets start getting to like triple digits like 100 101st Street start getting like a little asthma like ah  it's time to get a little high up here yeah you feel that little tightness in your chest can you feel that 106th Street you're like leaning on  like dude where'd all the cabs go how come there's no taxis up here dude what's a bodega I don't know what Dennis is let's get the  out of here so I'm praying to God she's gonna tell me to take the subway get off at like 105th Street 130 you know which is like the first stop in Harlem where I can still look over my shoulder and see like all the white people like disappearing Over the Horizon you know but she goes no man you want to get in the Uptown 2-3 train you want to get off at 125th Street I'm like ah  25th Street that's like right in the middle of everything I'm gonna be surrounded on all four sides I can't  do this so at this point I'm really trying to hide like the  tone that's starting to creep into my voice you know and I'm trying to ask for really specific directions when I get up there because I want to know exactly where I'm going so she starts naming the streets I have to go down and every other Street up there is named that's like a black leader you know she's like make a left on Adam Clayton take a right on Frederick Douglas oh my God  out of Clayton  did he kill a bunch of white people during the slave report dude icon that  I know what I'm saying to  this  so at this point I'm really having a battle with myself because I'm thinking I can't do this right I'm like I can't do this but my dick's going no come on man we can do this all right just relax pull yourselves together and get on the goddamn train right so as always I listen to my dick oh yeah I get on the train by the time I get up there it's like five or four in the morning right I'm staying on like Malcolm X and like Danny Glover or some  right I don't even know where the hell I'm at when I see the street I want to go up I want to go up Saint Nick I can literally see her apartment building but there's like five or six black dudes standing right on the corner right where I want to walk by so I'm like  I felt like I was on like some reality show at that point like some sort of like white guy Survivor he was ridiculous so I'm thinking I gotta walk right by these guys right you know what's funny I think that they were actually more surprised to see me than I was scared you know and I was really really scared you know but I'm also really really white you know like shockingly Caucasian you know what I mean like if you're not ready for me I can like surprise you now especially if you live up there you've probably seen a white person for hours possibly days so when I show up it's almost like magical like a leprechaun came out of nowhere you know I feel like I should have like a little pot of gold like a rainbow behind me top of the morning till you locked it it's gonna dance my way past them it's been going all right you know once I get in her apartment I'm fine you know I relax sit down you know watch A hip-hop countdown pretend like I know the groups you know what I mean it's just getting there that's a  pain in the ass but you know I don't get mad at it because I figure you know black dude's got to go through the same  though right when you go into the suburbs go  a white girl right just that same awful feeling but just leaving your people behind you know just less and less of you as you're  driving out there puppy start off lean and you're all  cool 20 minutes in you're driving like 10-2 to raise yourself like dude I like this  I don't like this  at all there's too much grass I don't see any rims  up none of the

guns they terrify me but i'm worried about the zombies all right dude's just like you need a shotgun you need a shotgun man it's got a good sprint it's easy to load doesn't have a lot of working parts got a good spread he kept saying that he's got a good spread i'm like what does that mean he goes well that means you ain't got to be that accurate it's got a good spread further away you are the more  you hit got a good spread in fact you got a problem over here you ain't even got to look you just turn wow that's it you ain't got a problem over here anymore anything that was even remotely a problem ain't there anymore trust me and then these people here they saw what you just did here you ain't got a problem here either 90 degrees taken care of right there one shot these people get smart

shotgun right that's not some  you can just come home with if i found this stool on the side of the road i can come home with this look at it we could we can refinish it we can carve our initials in it we can have a good time right they just show up with a shotgun hey i got it for us right one barrel for you one for me now so she ki washes the whole thing until the other night somebody broke into our car sitting in the driveway starts  with her head right so she starts reading up on guns you know she's reading too much because now she wants to get one but she's just like well i heard you got to keep the bullets in the safe keep this dock in the garage and then what then when i run around the house and assemble it there's some dudes chasing me with an axe you know even thinking this thing through sweetheart he's running around with where's the scope it's in the living room he's in the living room now we're getting this thing i want that  thing loaded right on the bedroom wall right there i'll put that thing in my jam jam sleeves just like that there's no other point that's funny though when you talk about getting a gun you know people like they either totally forward or completely against it you know they'll either go nuts and start screaming right well they start throwing out those stats yeah actually you you increase your chances of getting shot by 80 the second you get a gun in the house really what because i'm gonna load it and shower with it like the  i know it's dangerous you get a pool in your backyard you immediately increase your odds of drowning in your backyard right you couldn't do that before now you step on a rake and you go no i'm telling you i don't buy any of that  stats are so  stupid you know not that they're stupid it's the way people apply them you already have your mind made up and then you go to amrite.com you start memorizing a bunch of  and just just throw it up at people this guy tried to get me to go scuba diving i'm not going i don't want to get eaten by a shark he's like well actually 90 of shark attacks actually happen in shallow water it's like no  that's where the people are now it's called the beach 90 of people are frolicking along the coastline it's like there's people swimming to europe let's go to iceland you  right i don't know but actually i actually like los angeles one of the few east coast people that likes it all my  new york friends and boston friends they come out there try to get a good slice of pizza and four in the morning they can't like just  play socks it's not like exactly where i left what's the point of traveling if it's going to be different  that's so  stupid get a burrito and go on a hike what's wrong with you you're going to go to hawaii there's no pond hockey this place sucks i got to admit the only thing that freaks me out about los angeles is all the plastic surgery i don't get it why do people get plastic surgery you know why can't you just admit it's over you know you had your time stop trying to look  in your 50s it's weird with their faces yank back looking all shiny right not to mention they haven't even figured it out you know why would you get a facelift can't you look at other facelifts and realize they haven't worked all the bugs out yet right that's what you want to look like like you just lost a fight three days ago don't be a hero let somebody else go in there take the  beach you you lay back wait it out they're just lying to people i know it looks great it looks great put a little ice on it we'll see in a couple weeks all right

so young all right take it easy she gone she's gone all right shred everything shred it no you're nuts you wait it out let him figure it out then you  go in don't be a goddamn hero you know look at hair plugs hair plugs don't look half bad now saw this guy the other night on tv i got god i wish i did this 10 years ago it's like no you don't ten years ago when they were stapling ant legs to the top of people's heads remember that your eyes would water looking at their hairline like is that is that sewn in i see pine tar they used to put you in like a headlock hold still use like a nail gun hold stilt guys would tap out after a row and a half  it i don't give a  you wish you got hair plugs 10 years ago do you wish you got polio 60 years ago what else is on your wish list sir no you don't  with your face okay i understand liposuction they screw that up you can put on a shirt right there's no shirt for your face who do they think they're fooling but they're stupid you know and then you lie to yourself i'm just gonna do it i'm just gonna do this just just kind of just gonna have this done no you're not you're not you're just gonna wax the fender in your car then that's it the rest of it looks all shitty well maybe i just do the hood and maybe i'll do the back that's how it happens then you look like one of those real housewives face all twisted up  idiots how do i look man i'm idiots do you look like i'm in my 20s no you look weird you look  weird you still look like you're in your 50s i just can't guess what year anymore because i've never seen that year i've never seen that shiny  look it's almost like you discovered a new age between 52 and 53. yeah people there's nothing wrong with being 52 and looking 52. all right you're 52. you didn't get  yeah what would you rather be 52 and look 52 or be 52 and look like a 28 year old lizard all right that's your options at this point  you know what's really really like actually embarrassing is that the facelift that's predominantly a white problem do you notice that i've never seen a black person with a facelift ever other than like the jacksons but they're all out of their minds right because their dad made him rehearse all day and sleep in the fireplace i jamming all night get in there you bastards no hugs no kisses his face permanently twisted up from 50 years of screaming sing  it's understandable with them hey do you know why so many whities need facelifts i love that word i'm trying to bring it back i love it it's funny whitey you know why do you know why so many caucasians need facelifts because we don't know about lotion see that only half of you left that should have been everybody yeah but a lot of you were sitting there like well what about lotion what is this lotion you speak of and what is the magic dare in just to put it out there you can use lotion on other parts of your body besides your dick yeah if you ever wondered why your dick still looks brand new but the rest of you was starting to look like an aging pirate because you need to increase the circumference of the lotion distribution all right you got skin everywhere  oh check yourself out the bottom of your feet look like a prehistoric riverbed that's not part of the natural aging process you dried out i'm not judging you not judging anybody i didn't know anything about lotion never used it the first 33 years of my life never used it until one night i was going out with this black girl right she was getting ready and she was just putting that  on everywhere just slathering it on i thought she had like a rash or something like poison what's going on with you she goes no i'm just making sure i'm not ashy i said ashy she goes dry skin i went mom i guess i freaked around a little bit because i was like ah she's like well white people get ashy too i was like yeah you know and i don't think we do yeah i've been alive for 33 years no one has ever said hey billy you're looking a little ashy i never even heard that word until you said it  she's like you're an idiot stick out your arm so i stick out my arm and ever so gently she just drags her nails down this smoke starts coming up it's like pastry flakes flying off track marks she's signing her name she's like you see that she goes that's ashy you're ash freak me out i'm like oh  i'm ashy  i didn't know anything about it all i knew was that i always got itchy in the winter figure it out always got itchy in the window what the  do i get itchy i thought it went the bath towel was dirty that's what i thought and i would change it out and put a fresh one now i'm gonna be okay take a shower dry off  itching again god damn it i hate the winner see that that's why you got to hang out with everybody yeah there's too much information in the world and every group of people misses a little bit white people totally missed the lotion seminar at some point in history i don't know if cause we can't see it you know black people get ashy it looks like they like leaned up against a chalkboard or something you know they can see it they miss it their friends help them out like look at your ashy  elbow what is wrong with you right we missed that  the way black people missed the whole register your weapons summit right just never got the information the amount of rappers who've been busted for the unregistered glock in the car just blows my mind it's like why would you do that to yourself do you just want to make an album over the phone is that what it is is that like the new auto tune or some  i don't know no it breaks my heart every time i see it i just think god if he just had one white friend he just had one white friend in his entourage dude would have been sitting there going like is that thing registered you out of your mind get it out of there get it out of there yeah it's illegal that's like  three to five mandatory dude how do you how do you not know that that's the question how do you not  know that this guy's got an unregistered weapon in the car like we're just gonna go driving around with it it's just ridiculous so see there you go all right you don't need a facelift okay lay off the booze do some cardio moisturize you're gonna be fine okay don't believe in these myths black don't crack it's  they all put lotion on like every 20 minutes during the day it's ridiculous they'll get a giant oil drum with the  at home every morning they wake up they dump themselves in it shake themselves off and walk out the door absolutely glistening listening white guys like me are walking around no hat on oh let's go sailing passing out face down in the sand speaking of no boozer man i've been i've been really trying to clean up my act as far as that boozing thing goes just really been laying off it you know i

do have a dog that doesn't count for anything i've never understood that you know i love my dog but uh i've learned a lot of being a dog owner man you know any dog's a good dog unless you're a psycho you know i got a pit bull it's still a great dog unless you're a  psycho and evidently i'm a psycho because my dog has been i've just been a complete maniac over the last like six months you know i didn't realize that dogs feed off your vibes you know like if you're chilling they're chilling you know if you're sleeping they're sleeping but if you're a psycho like me and you're screaming at the ref on tv being like dude you gotta be  kidding me i didn't realize that dog was over in the corner being like yeah you gotta be  kidding me this is  i don't know what this guy's mad at but i love this guy this guy feeds me is it the door are you mad at the door yeah i had no idea i was amping this dog up i was so selfishly in my own world i'd be like on the computer and would crash oh really really dog's over in the corner with like a chew toy i never noticed like that game seven look she was getting on her face and one day i amped her up too much had no clue and i went outside we were just walking down the street and some poor bastard comes the other way the dog's like that's that  lunge at this guy i had to pull her back all right dude i'm sorry man i'm sorry she's never done anything like that right looking down to dog what's wrong with you dogs looking at me like huh i got that son of a  didn't i i love you you feed me i got you how the hell did you see him that far away man your ears must be better than mine it's unbelievable right then i got nervous i got nervous around my own dog i started thinking  are pit bulls really like this do they just go psycho man this is nuts right that's another bad vibe to have around your dog because they pick up on that vibe right this dude comes walking down the street and miley's just start thinking like oh  she gonna do it again oh  oh  dog just looks at me like oh  what oh  what him hit him runs in another guy hit a polar bear jesus christ i'm sorry looking down at the dog dogs trying to chest bump me and  right dude it got so bad one day she almost she almost ate a landscaper right yeah so i'm like i gotta i gotta take this thing to a trainer man so i load it up in the prius and i drive over there right yeah i have a prius go ahead judge me  i love that  if you have a prius people you know you can't win you got a truck with a big lift kit people oh it's fine because he has a little dick right how come it's not because he is a dick down to the floor maybe that's why he needs all that clearance right you know if that means you have a little dick then if i have a prius doesn't that mean i have a huge dick right because according to my friends it means i'm a  right  anyways let me towel off here for a moment so i  take this dog down to this train all right and i show up got the dog in the back train comes out he's got his hat on backwards he got stubble you know big large cargo pants you know all shorts on and stuff and i'm thinking this guy's a psycho right and i look at my dog my dog's like sizing him up i'm like just perfect he can handle him so the guy goes all right when you hand this dog to me make sure you got the lease totally taught like that all right don't have any slacking i said no problem right and somehow i  up i left a little slack in it and this dog just lunged right at the dude's balls all right and just barely missed him and just got a big mouth full of his big cargo shorts right and immediately just grabbed and goes all right get out of here get out of here right but instinctively i tried to help out he just goes get the  outta here yeah i didn't realize that the only reason why the dog was acting like that was because i was there and it felt like it needed to protect me so the second i left the situation immediately just became awkward right dog was just sitting there like okay like i thought we were like together and we were like friends and you were some bad guy and all of a sudden he just drove away and i don't know how to feed myself you want to be friends  yeah come back four days later the dog's laying at the guy's feet all right he's rubbing her belly she's reaching up playing with his goatee and  and he goes back have a seat why don't you uh why don't you uh take me through your day with this dog immediately i started getting like this first 48 vibe right like they're coming at me so i got like defensive i'm like i take it for a hike every morning he goes that's good that's good anything you know special happen on the hike like well you know i don't know she takes a  i pick it up it's like all right easy you play any games with her i go yeah at the end of the hike i let her i let her you know for reward for going on the hike i let her run up the stairs by herself i go go on cleo and let her run up the stairs and i count five one thousand and then i run up there and then we start wrestling put her in a headlock sweep her front legs right but a tail's wagging you know she's not growling i go that's a good thing right he's like no it's  horrible i'm like why he goes you just taught your dog to claim the house and then fight for it every  day after the hike no wonder this thing's trying to attack the mailman you know so then i got upset i'm like wait a minute dude you're telling me like i can't even play with my dog he's like no you can play with it but you got to bring that energy back down the problem is you keep amping this thing up getting that mike singletary look on his face and by the time you walk out doesn't matter if you're relaxed mentally the dog is like walking through the tunnel at the rose bowl like this is what we play for somebody hit somebody  beth so i'm actually learning to control my temper because of a  pitbull so i don't know my girl's been bugging me lately she's ready to settle down i think i'm ready to settle down too you know i got the one i know i've been saying this  for years i have been you know she's great the only thing i don't like is she uh she's really into reality tv she watches all those dumb shows put ten  in the house somebody tries to find a wife right she watches fat people cry about fudgicals blubbering their eyes oh no sometimes i don't even open the wrapper i just started and then i get down to the stick and i know i should stop because it's made out of wood she's just saying crying right along with them damn throw yourself in the river you fat  ah she gets so mad at me look i don't put on tv to cry i like to be entertained i love when they fall in the treadmill and go flying into the drywall it's like some modern day medieval weapon i love it all those horrific shows biggest fights we have she watches uh intervention this isn't enough that yeah that's it you like that oh my god it's so awesome watching a family completely fall apart what is entertaining about that when they had that classic before picture the pre-meth picture she was so beautiful she was the prom queen everybody loved her then they cut to her like laying in like a gutter i'll suck your dick i'll suck your dick i'll suck your dick  no we have these huge battles you know what the matter she ever got at me was one time she was watching this show was like a poor excuse for the view and they started talking about domestic violence right for the 9 millionth time this year they're talking about domestic violence just in case you know you didn't get the memo you know evidently you know just some people didn't get it it's not okay to slam your wife's head into the cupboard drawers because she didn't dry the can opener off properly you know it's gonna  rust right how do you not know not to do that  do they really have to keep talking about it it's like wife beaters watching for oh  ah now i get it up so daisy sweetheart here we go there you go  so at the end of the hour they come to the logical conclusion they're like there is no reason to hit a woman there is no reason to hit a woman and i was just like really i could give you like 17 right off the top of my head you could wake me from a drunken stupor i could still give you like nine dude there's plenty of reasons to hit a woman you just don't do it but to sit there and suggest that there's no reason dude the level of ego behind that statement what are you levitating above the rest of us you're never annoying women how many times have you thought about slapping you you  guy in the head this week there you go every day you didn't do it right oh dude it drives me nuts there's no reason there's no reason really no reason how about this you marry a girl you fall in love you buy her a house you go to work every day paying off the house you come home one day she's banging the next door neighbor hand you divorce papers you got to move out sleep on a futon and still pay for that house that she's going to stay in no reason i'm not saying you should do it but there's plenty of  reasons in that arc of a story all right that was a hypothetical you want an actual story i'll give you one i'll give you one all right i  up my foot playing drums trying to get my bass drum foot as fast as uh john bonham's because i figured that's a good thing to focus on 43 years of age never married no kids i figured this this is going to lead me to the light right this this is what i need to do so i don't know what i did i i felt like after i played for like an hour and afterwards i felt like it literally like there was some  stabbing me in the bottom of my foot right like i had lightning coming out of the bottom of my foot so i did the typical guy thing like i'm not going to the hospital sleep it off be fine right next morning i wake up my foot's even worse and i gotta walk my crazy dog so i'm like i can't do it my foot's killing me so i wake up my girl go sweetheart sweetheart can you do me a favor can you do me a favor can you walk the dog for me can you uh just take the shift you know i'll do your afternoon shift can you just do me this all you can do this for me and she's just like oh you know i had a late late night last night i'm tired i have a big day and i just go  it she goes what do you mean  it it's like why can't you just say no why do you always gotta like waterboard me with like a 20-minute explanation that eventually lines its way around to go  yourself just say no so i'm just limping out of the room whatever go back to bed you got a big dave right so now i'm like limping down the street i got like tourette's  goddamn  dogs walking next to me  i gotta admit i got a little childish i did i got a little childish you know i was just thinking about my relationship i'm like this is the relationship i'm in you're just gonna do whatever the hell you want to do right and  me fine i'm gonna do whatever hell i wanna do i feel like listening to my ipod on full blast walking around the house that's what i'm gonna do so that's what i did turned it all the way up and i just my whole plan was just to walk by her like i didn't even know her that was it she came down the hall i just ghosted her just walked right past her just trying to piss her off and i got to tell you something work like a charm work like a charm yeah hung my coat up turned around by the time i turned around she was already yelling at me but the music was so loud not only could i not hear her it actually looked like she was singing the song that i was listening to oh it's one of the highlights of the relationship so i knew what she was saying i was like whatever i don't want to talk about it leave me alone i'm going onto the computer right so i limp over and i sit down and unbeknownst to me she's like now we're going to talk about this right now comes up and slaps the headphones off my head i got a big i got big ears it  hurt so i'm like honey leave me alone i don't want to talk about it put the headphones back on she comes right back up again slaps them off a little harder this time they spin halfway around my head caveman dna starts coming up talking through my teeth honey leave me alone don't want to talk about it right put him on third time she comes up slaps him right across the room and i snap i'm like fine you want to have the fight let's  have the fight she's like we will discuss this later when you calm down oh right there i just wanted to roll her up on her yoga mat and stuff her behind the couch just leave her there until she got thirsty come on let me out of here i have a spin class you've made your point this is this is ridiculous  no that's the thing really is that's the thing i hate that saying there's no reason obviously i'm not saying to hit a woman you know but saying there's no reason i think that's crazy when you say there's no reason that kills any sort of examination as to how two people ended up at that at that place you say there's no reason you cut out the buildup you just left with the act how are you gonna solve it if you don't figure it out look how awkward it is in here right now i said you shouldn't hit a woman i'm just saying how come you can't ask questions you can only ask questions about what the guy did you can never ask about the woman why is that why is that what is that what is what does answering write me what does that mean are you the idiot who got up halfway through the special during the bit and you're like walking around like i'm not  taping a special here what's wrong with you what's wrong with you  had to ignore all of that and now you're gonna like yell out and not only that yells something that makes no  sense whatsoever answer him answer him  every  special i do there's always one oh he's right down the  middle talking about hitting women sweetheart and i think you just added another reason jesus  christ i love this i'm not even in a relationship with her and she's  nagging me   unbelievable look i understand hitting a woman's a bad thing okay how come you can't  ask questions i just don't understand like if i get bit by a rattlesnake wouldn't you guys have some questions right how did it happen did you not see it were you  with it how did this snake get so mad it almost killed you firemen put out a fire they don't just drive away afterwards they sift through the debris how did it start here's an oily rag right look i realize i'm coming off pretty ignorant right about now i realize that  let me extend an olive branch then okay i realize that there's some animal guys out there okay horrible guys you know have a rough day at the factory come home tune a casserole and just start swinging all right i'm not trying to say that those people don't exist i realize they exist they should be buried underneath the prison okay so if i can admit that ladies can you at least admit that every ass kicking doesn't just fall out of the  sky really even hockey has two minutes for instigating right they understand that some back and forth happened before that  you know you know what it is is every case is handled like that rihanna one well they just say the guy's a piece of   this guy blah blah send them to jail and they never ask anything about that you know i'm not saying he should have done it but i'm just saying just say it dude in your heart of hearts what do you think was going down before that happened you think she was just sitting there going oh my god baskin robbins you want to get some ice cream  you know what do you think maybe they were having some epic end of the relationship fight and some crazy  was being said maybe she was screaming in his ears some crazy female  like oh  all your friends i don't give a   maybe that's why i sell more albums than you  right to be fair she could have just been sitting there going i need a tissue do you keep those in the glove box oh my god i'll bring my house  that because you know what it is they never address how women argue which i think is a core of a lot of that  you know i got to tell you something man like i never knew how women argued but after 20 years of losing every significant battle in a relationship i finally figured out how they argued i'm going to tell you something i'm starting to turn this franchise around i have begun a winning tradition this is how they argue as far as i can tell all right if they're right they argue the point and they stay on point and make sure you stay on point until you're down on your knees apologizing begging for forgiveness all right no problem with that totally respect it but here's the thing if they're wrong they go rogue they go off-road they start thinking of  you're sensitive about maybe you don't get along with your dad and in their head they just start concocting this evil statement totally designed this desperate hail mary attempt to make you so  mad you just call him a  that's what it is and  trumps all the  they did to start the argument now it's not about that well there's no reason to call me a  and then that's it you're in this room now right my girl knows my big thing is my big fear in life is to be that dude who grows old you know grows old alone has like that basement apartment just screaming up at the younger couple turn it down that isn't music so i noticed that anytime she was losing a fight i don't know what she just feels like that's why you're just going to grow old and be alone then i lose my  next thing you know i'm in the kitchen washing dishes for the ninth  time in a row this is what the argument was about i was so right what happened so if you learn anything from my ignorance tonight just know this next time you're in a battle with your beautiful woman your wife girlfriend whatever and they start out of nowhere okay you're winning and they just start saying that crazy  out of nowhere just know in that moment you've won the fight okay all right don't get mad bob and weave slip all of that  maybe because you got a little dick just let that slide stay in the pocket of the argument okay it's over the argument is over you one just take a knee and run out the clock all right yes lean on the ropes let them punch themselves out and then in the end you throw their psychology right back at them well maybe we should discuss it later when you calm down and they won't hook up with you for a couple of days who cares who cares you rub one out rub one out like a man it's a champagne a victory oh that's what i've learned i finally learned to like keep my cool in my relationship happened a couple years ago right me and my girl had this big argument one day right actually you guys want to hear a story you want to hear about the time my girl punched me in the face on her birthday you want to hear that one this is what happened to me i'm really honest the fight started like three months earlier it's like the middle of march we're just driving around nelson she sees this closing store she's like oh my god i didn't know they had one of those out here we need to stop and go in there so i  it let's go in there i walk in immediately i see it's one of these stores that doesn't have any chairs and i know what they're trying to do i'm gonna be standing right next to her and when she likes something i gotta buy it i don't give a  i'm not playing that i go over and i sit down underneath a mannequin got like the dress hanging in my head sir you can't sit there i don't give a  looks like i'm doing it looks like i'm doing it all right so unbeknownst to me she finds some sweater that she likes right some ridiculously priced like 400 bucks or some  like that right so she knows it's not her birthday none of that crap she can't ask me for it so now she's got to go into manipulation mode what do i use what do i use do i be sad do i pout do i use sex can't do that you know what she went with she went with the little girl right she just came out she's just like mike what's up she's like saw something that i liked i just want to be like well then why don't you  pay for it  cause she goes over and she shows it to me right and i'm like it's 400 bucks she goes can you get it i go no i'm not doing that  that it's not your birthday it's not valentine's day it's march am i getting you there for st patrick's day get the  out of here i'm not doing it  so i don't want to happen we're driving home and somehow she manipulated the the argument not that she asked for the sweater and not that i said no it's the way i said no right gotten this huge argument got so mad by the time i we got to back to the house i just told her to get out i'm driving away so i just drove away in the prius right so i was so  up about it i had to call my sister up right call her up to get a female perspective she's laughing her ass off going you took all the bait you're an idiot i go what do i do she goes why don't you go back down to the store and just buy this sweater hold on to it and give it to her a few months later for her birthday i'm like  genius genius i hate the pressure of the birthday all her friends oh what are you getting yeah where are you gonna get her  sweater  bam that's it got it all right fast forward three months it's her birthday right she's you know i'm laying in bed she wakes up she want to go to some restaurant that night she's like did you make the reservations i'm like i haven't made them yet but we'll you know we'll be good right she starts freaking out what do you mean it's my birthday what do you need to make he didn't make the reservations i'm like sweetheart it's a tuesday in the middle of a recession i'm sure that there's going to be a table right so she starts freaking out in the back of my head i'm like i got this sweater i'm good right so the more she yells at me the funnier it becomes to me but like an  rather than laughing to myself i sort of snickered out loud right sort of giggled a couple times and she just snapped like are you laughing at me are you laughing at me on my birthday and then the more she yelled the more i laughed the more i laughed the more she yelled and it was just this vicious  thing all the way up right to go she got all the way to the point she was standing at the back door going you're gonna laugh at me on my birthday  you boom slams the door runs down the stairs at that point i'm literally in the fetal position like dying laughing walking towards the bathroom then i'll start here she came back up the stairs and i'm not gonna lie to you i got a little scared for a half second no i did i was in my underwear i was feeling vulnerable she comes flying into the bathroom and the second i saw her face i knew she was gonna hit me right and i'm such an  i actually have a game plan for when a woman's gonna hit you like that's how many women i've pissed off in my lifetime i actually know what's going down this is how it is most women they're flailers all right unless they had some sort of mma training then you're on your own you're probably gonna catch a few right but most of them are flailers most are right-handed so you gotta guess overhand right that's the first thing you gotta guess so you get down in the pocket right that overhand right comes in bam you catch that wrist second the right's coming you know the left's coming bam you catch that one this is the crucial moment second you got the right the next then you got the left immediately you got to step back and you got to go like this  cause she's gonna try to kick you right in the balls as she kicks you then you spin them around tuck your head down low because they will try to headbutt you and then you just use the weight of your torso to slowly bring them down to the floor as you whisper sweet things oh look at the tiles remember you picked those out they go so well with the wallpaper right but she tricked me she came into the bathrooms and she invented this new punch she didn't throw a right she didn't throw a left she came i think there's two fisted i called it like the defibrillator right just caught me in the shoulder and like in my appendix it's a  bam like that almost went flying back into the bathtub and i caught myself and she's all ready for me to take the bait and flip up and i didn't i just remained calm i was just like sweetheart i think you need to go to work now she didn't know what to do she was like and she just just walked out right went down the car drove to work i walked out in the kitchen i got some cheerios sat down and started watching sportscenter  three minutes later all of a sudden the phone rings all right pick up the phone and just hear her going hi okay things got a little crazy like a little crazy you almost split my head open in the goddamn tub i'm sorry i'm just i'm i'm passionate i'm pat that's what they say when they start swinging i'm passionate i just have so much love for you i try to cause you to have a seizure i don't know i'm good at this i  up my personal life all the time man i really do you know i'm afraid to get married man why why wouldn't as man wouldn't be afraid to get married at this point you know look at kobe look at the  he's going through right now all right guys getting a divorce his wife's gonna get 70 million bucks never hit a layup in her life you know can anybody explain these divorce settlements can anybody make sense of this  thing tiger wood's wife 250 million dollars she's a babysitter with a quarter of a billion  dollars somebody go ahead somebody explain justify it justify it what what he cheated on her i don't give a  yeah i don't give a  he cheated on it great the relationship's over right then kobe cheated right shouldn't that relationship been over right then why did she hang around like some jaded cop for three years trying to get a  pension right get that 10 years in i don't know maybe that's too harsh that  bothers me man dude there is an epidemic of gold digging  in this country and every night i put on the news and i'm waiting for someone to address it every night never see it you know and every night i bring up gold digging  and the whole crowd pulls back like i'm up here talking about bigfoot right like i'm saying the moon's made out of cheese or something talking about  people they're everywhere how many how many more great men are going to get chopped in half before we do something why is it so quiet in here god damn i don't get it what is it is it women do you think i'm calling you i'm not calling any woman here a  okay so don't pull back that's not fair okay if you brought up wife beaters i wouldn't like pull back i get it this guy's hitting women they need to be stopped we gotta understand that gold digging  are the wife beaters for men yeah they are except we don't have that rihanna lumped up photo in the end so it's not obvious it's in the eyes it's in the lines in your face it's in mel gibson's high-pitched voice on the answering machine i had to give up my laker tickets right that is the sound of a man being taken for everything he's got i got to tell you this i'm envious of women okay i'm not saying your problems get solved but at least they're taken seriously you know people you got 1 800 numbers you get you got ribbons there's groups people give a  anything happens to a guy who's just considered funny some woman cut her husband's dick off threw in the garbage disposal and turned it on people thought it was hilarious everything hey stumpy nobody cares do you think of a guy removed a woman's titty and threw it in the dryer anybody would be joking about it the next day the entire country would grind to a halt there'd be a moment of silence the nfl would have some special colored headband everybody had to wear for an entire month the most effeminate color they could possibly come up with  all my heroes are going down arnold schwarzenegger another great man another great man taken down by that gold-digging  of a man he's got and i'm not i'm not saying he's not a piece of  for doing what he did was a piece of  move but how come only he got chastised what about the maid why was she called the maid that entire story she was never called a  ever just boggled my mind she knew his wife first name basis played with their kids  her husband in their own goddamn bed that's right down the checklist first ballot hall of fame  right there never why do you think she hooked up with them because of that 1987 flat top he's still rocking the giant space between his teeth i could put this mic cord through i think maybe it's all that kindergarten cop money laying around the goddamn bedroom no it's awful it's a horrific thing to see as a guy watching guys go through that  you know and then there's no there's no sort of examination of it they just go he's an idiot hey stupid that guy's stupid if that guy's stupid what the  am i right does it even make sense why would you do that why would you accomplish all that and then  it up hooking up with one of the ugliest human beings i've ever seen in my life not saying i'm a prize i'm just saying you know there's got to be something beyond that right you know i think it is i think it comes down to the way he talks you know  that dude should be unloading trucks in transylvania that should be that should have been the height of his success but because he's a great man he had the balls to move to america became famous for lifting weights i lift weights nobody gives a  he lifts weights becomes super famous did he rest on his laurels no next challenge i'm gonna become an actor despite the fact that nobody can really understand me against all odds he starts making movies get down there's a bomb gets out of there becomes one of the biggest blockbuster stars of all time what are you gonna do next arnie i think i'm maddia kennedy there's no  way you can do that bam he does it cherry on top i'm running for governor of a state i can't even pronounce and he wins the election why wouldn't this guy think he couldn't bang his maid in his own bed and get away with it this dude has been in the zone for over four decades four decades nothing but net bang a maid in my own bed dude that's a layup are you serious i had a hit movie with the  i don't even need a condom right and then what happens the smoke clears then all

Bill Burr,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkK0MYD-HcI, actually I got a couple of friends of African persuasion and I gotta get rid of a man I gotta meet to you I'm fine I'm spending too much money on clothes hanging out with them cuz I gotta like  trying to keep up with their wardrobe it's like every time they go out they got all brand-new  on all brand new  so when I show up with my white version of brand new which is odd thing you know I basically I iron the  right high iron detritus till they just start trashing me I can't keep up with the man they got like  58 pairs of sneakers ever notice that  like every color  Timberland and I don't give a  what  up color that shirt is they got a pair of shoes to match it and a hack it's like a rule of something they're the worst even when you wear some new  there's like some sort of rule that you got to like space out the amount of time with within which like that you wear it because god forbid you wear the same shirt within a 10 day period one of them's gonna notice don't son just look at you finding like this  got the same  he had on last toast  but everybody just stops making fun of you  close first they do the math like who's that five days ago five days this  got five shirts five shirts they start breaking it down no it's for sure if you saying Monday next ship you're saved Tuesday you're the week and he ain't be wearing no shirt I'll tell it's actually funny you know what that's actually how how I judge black guys now when I first came in the city like all black people scared me I was like the typical white dude from like the suburbs you know I mean it had no frame of reference you know it's my only frame of reference with black people's like the remember early 90s gangster rap videos throw the  LA riots in there man was  horrible PR I'm watching the video so he's got nice car he's got all the women and he's still  mad these tattoos are never happy but after ten years of living in the seat is how I narrow it down well the black doom scares me not black dudes with dirty sneakers scare the   out of it that's the last  that they're gonna let go the immediate  that they have on so I think you know if his sneakers are  up that means his life is  up every time he leaves his building the whole neighborhood oh  everyone starts making fun of them he's on the train in a bad mood I kind of have this howdy-doody kind of mug me kind of face now I'm not saying something's gonna happen I'm just saying I'm paying attention so I've been seeing this girl recently uh it's black oh right she lives up in Harlem you know going out like three four times you know first time we hung out we hung out like the Village area in New York you know which is sort of like a racially mixed area so  was cool you know what I mean second time we hung out was more like Midtown you know then the third time she called me at like 3:30 in the morning and she wanted me to come up to her apartment right so it's 3:30 in the morning she lives in Harlem I look how I look so it's a  situation cuz you know the tail right reasonably a white dude feels comfortable up to about like 98 99th Street you know I'm saying the second the streets are cut into like triple digits like a hundred 101st Street circuit like a little Aspen like feel that tightness in your chest can you feel it I don't sixth Street you like leaning on  like dude where'd all the cats go how come this no taxis up here so what's a bodega get the foot batter so I'm praying to God she's gonna tell me to take the subway get off at like 150 Reed Hundt 13 which is like the first stop in Harlem where I can still look over my shoulder and see like all the white people like disappearing over the horizon you know but she goes no man you want to get in the Uptown 2 3 train you want to get off at a hundred and twenty fifth Street Jesus Christ that's like the middle of everything so at this point I'm really trying to hide like the  tone that's starting to creep into my voice you know and I'm trying to ask for really specific directions for when I get up there cuz I want to know exactly what I'm going so she starts naming the streets I have to go down and every other Street up there's name that's like a black leader you know she's like make a left on Adam Clayton take a right on Frederick Douglas oh my god  late on the internet look the metal-flake did he kill a bunch of white people during the slave revolt dude ain't going up there till he knew how to think  this   so at this point I'm really having a battle with myself cuz I'm thinking I can't do this right I'm like I can't do this for my dick scone oh come on man we can do this all right just relax pull yourself together and get on the goddamn train right so as always I listen to my dick oh yeah I get on the train by the time I get up there it's like five or four in the morning right I'm standing on like Malcolm X and like Danny Glover or some  right I don't even know who the hell I'm at when I see the street I want to go up I want to go up Saint Nick I can literally see her apartment building but there's like five or six black dudes standing right on the corner right where I want to walk by somebody  I thought it was on like some reality show at that point like some sort of like white guy survivor he was ridiculous so I'm thinking I gotta walk right by these guys right you know it's funny I think that they were actually more surprised to see me than I was scared you know and that was really really scared you know but I'm also really really white you know like shockingly Caucasian you know I feel like if you're not ready for me I can like surprise you now especially if you live up there you've probably seen a white person for hours possibly days so when I show up it's almost like magical like a leprechaun came out of nowhere you know felt like I should have like a little pot of gold like a rainbow behind me top of the morning to you liked it it's gonna dance my way past them but it's been going alright you know once I get in her apartment I'm fine you know I relax sit down you know watch a hip hop countdown like I know the group's you know to me it's just getting there that's a  pain in the ass but you know I don't get mad at it cuz I figure you know black dudes gotta go through the same  though right when you go into the suburbs go  a white girl right just that same awful feeling but just leaving your people behind you know just less and less of you is you  driving out there puppy start off lean and y'all  cool twenty minutes in you're driving like ten into the rail yourself thank you and I like this  I don't like this  at all there's too much grass I don't see any rims none of the windows are tinted I can clearly see white people in every part of this  up listen you guys were awesome thank you so much for coming out god bless you thank you very much Oh

helicopter how the hell she get a helicopter i haven't accomplished anything i'm a disgrace you know i love about that show though all they're doing is showing you what not to do when you get rich seriously because none of those people are saving their money half of them all they have is one hit song so should they really be buying all that  seriously 20 room house seven eight cars it's just like dude don't you watch behind the music you know what i mean you're gonna be smoking crack in like six weeks hold on to this  they never invest it they never get like you know cds they always like i always wanted a ferris wheel so i got olympic ferris wheel i got one from my monkey i have my own arcade dumb man they're all gonna go broke stupid they're stupid man you want to know how to be rich don't look at a rapper don't look at a rock star they don't know what they're doing look at a guy like bill gates that guy is good at being rich you know he makes 30 million dollars a day can you believe that look how he dresses he dresses like he works in like a shoe store got that same piece of  blue blazer it's very you know it's very works everywhere i go gets my loafers you know kind of he's on a budget that's why he's always gonna be rich he's not buying a bunch of flashy  like walking around like an iced out laptop medallion hanging on his net some fuzzy pimp hat to the side starting  with ibm microsoft's on your own soon  sitting in a hot tub with some  have a  in his crew just for the  of it you know what i mean it's starting  hey that's the new status symbol the rich people love midgets if you notice that no entourage is complete now unless you have a  you gotta have a  and you know what that's good for midgets that's good for those people because historically they have not gotten good jobs even when they book a movie they never get to be the hero they always got to play like a troll or a fairy running out from under a bridge biting on somebody's ankle it's horrible i feel  bad for midgets i still call them midges too i know you're supposed to call them little people now i think that sounds worse don't you it's like you're a little person yes you are does the little person want to come up on the big stage i like  but what's wrong with  that's a good word it's a tough word my  mission  that's political correctness out of control there was no reason to change   wasn't a racial slur right  weren't dragged here from another country forced to do cartwheels in a circus it's just a word that's a table that's a chair and you're a  no hatred there no they're  they're irritating i'm really sick of midgets no they think you see i don't know who the  is leading the midgets okay but the dude he's not doing a good job see they're changing their names because they're trying to get us to stop laughing at him and they think if they you know it's like dude you got to get a real  job they just don't want to work they're always on trampolines always jumping out of cars 50 of their friends running around always playing circus get a real  job get off get off of the trampoline get into a cubicle get some sort of customer service  then yeah get a suit run around like a  clown all the what a time thing to be mad about really getting sick of these  magics so i was watching uh george bush today give some sort of speech or try to i should say you guys like george bush you know what you know i like about george bush he makes me feel like i could be president too you know he's like the first guy from like my reading level you know what i mean first guy from my math class to actually make it you know he's the worst you know what i love about that guy he can't say the word terror he uses the word every speech he can't say terror he goes dare it says he goes america will not stand protect  anybody who supports terror  if you're terrorist we're gonna get you what kind of president goes we're going to get you  he's like some redneck they dragged out of a barbecue put them in a suit dude if you go we're going to get you you should be just standing on stage with like a couple of bloodhounds going go get them blue smell the shirt get the scent go get them damn that blue's a good doe i'll tell you one thing i have realized though when you go to war man that's the one time when you really have to like appreciate rednecks though you know that you know why because rednecks are like the one group of people that actually like want to go to war no they do they're up for that's like their super bowl you know they're like making dip and  you know what i mean they really want to go everybody else tries to get out of it like rich people never go to war you know you ask a college kid if he wants to go to wars just like um i'm taking this sociology class i think war is like really stupid my roommate's like half afghanis that's going to cause some static you ask a redneck if he wants to go to warriors just like he'll  yeah i'm ready right now you just point the direction buddy i'm ready to do this  all my life people telling me i'm   up no they're frightening people but you got to utilize them seriously you want to scare the enemy all right and rednecks are like america's pit bulls they should just sedate those people drop them off in afghanistan just let them run wild just be like dude just go do everything you ever dreamed of doing just go  crazy have one of your friends play the banjo it'll scare the  out oh that's what i would do draft psychos don't draft decent people don't draft some dude who works at staples  that we need him keep him going to the swamps of this country get people rabies get perverts get people like to jerk off in public you know just get like the cancer of this society get like homeless people who like to talk to buildings just send all that  over there a bunch of freaks run right here where the  the summer just irritate them send people over who talk too loud on their cell phones yeah i just got a cheeseburger no that just makes sense to me rednecks are psychopaths you wouldn't want to draft a guy like me i'm a comedian i'm useless i am i'm lazy i'm a coward i don't like confrontations you draft a redneck not only is that due to psycho he'll actually save your money those guys show up to the army you're like here's your m16 they're like i already got one i got some  in the trunk you ain't ever seen before buddy i went on ebay got me some of that surface-to-air  took it out hunting got me a moose and a duck at the same  time i didn't even see the duck duck was over her i'm aiming at the moose ducks over her that's my peripheral over her and the shot went up the moose's ass and the shrapnel from his antler hit the duck duck came down was the best goddamn duck ever right  no they're hilarious funny people but you got to give it up to them because they're patriotic they're patriotic people those sons of  you'll never catch a red redneck at like an anti-war protest going hell no we won't go they're just like wait i get to kill people and i ain't going to jam wait a minute are they foreigners oh my god hey dale come on you're gonna miss it hurry

all right none of that swiss  i don't trust it it's got all them holes in it people looking at you nah i just get i get nervous when i go down are we saying that  up  south's gonna rise again do what secede from the union  morons  was 200 years ago 150 years ago you know you lost get over it yeah so i live in new york man i'm not from there but uh no i'm not from actually from massachusetts just sounds better if you say you live in new york yeah from new york i hate taking the subways man i got to get a car i can't handle that  you know what i hate taking the selfies i have a very like howdy duty kind of mug me kind of face  people always  with me when i'm on the train i hate the train i'm always scared when i'm on the train there's always somebody yelling  you ever been standing on the platform late at night and you hear the crazy dude coming  you're like oh  come on train come on drink come on please  starts getting closer god damn kill some  like oh  please express strength please you ever do the  with the guys coming and you hide on the other side of the pole and you just go all the way around and say come find  i gotta shoot so this isn't right they just ought to have one car for all the crazy people they do that when you go to jail they put the murderers over there if you're just some dude who you know did some lighter  you don't  throw everybody together it's crazy i was on the i was on downtown 6 in new york one time it's true story i'm sitting there i'm staring at the floor not doing the sign thing staring at the floor there's like 20 other people in the middle of the train all of a sudden i hear this lady's voice at the back of the train i swear to god she's sitting there she's going she's going out go on my neck i swear to god she's like you're hurting me  and you know it's like you don't want to look when some  like that's happening i mean just kind of sitting there going  settle that make it go away don't want to see the rest of that  but it just keeps going she's going to sin so finally i gotta look i looked down i swear to god man this dude he's got his girl like right by the back of the neck he's going you shut the  up you shut up she's like shut up so i don't know what the hell to do because it's like i really want to help her out but i don't really know how to fight so what am i gonna do i'm gonna walk down the end of the train five seconds later i'm gonna be going  so i didn't do  i didn't i just sat there i was like  she picked them it's not my problem maybe she's into that type of stuff i don't want to know you know what i love about that joke that show only works in cities that have subways people who ride subways love that joke i tell that joke in the middle of nowhere people just stare at me like i'm an  but it's like oh my god that's terrible it was a disturbance she didn't try to intervene but why didn't you just separate the parties that's some  you do when you first come to the city like oh my god there's a problem i think i'll help out stab stab stamp see i said that  to you guys you just like you did the right thing you did the right thing it was already a tragedy no sense making it a massacre somebody had to be around to describe the assailant it might as well have been here every time every time i get on the train now i just i just feel like i'm just i'm just pressing my luck i was on the train about three weeks ago true story listen to this  this black guy goes to get on the train right and the door is like closed on him you know when that  happens just kind of like open and shut like like almost like he's trying to dice you up  there's like 20 people watching and nobody  helps they're just like wow i think it's going to cut his arm off so the dude is stuck in the doors the conductor comes out and starts giving him  as he's stuck in the door it's going come on buddy let's go come on you hold people up let's go so the dude the door flips eyes like what the  are you yelling at me for he's like i'm stuck in the doors then he makes it racial he's like what no  white people ever got stuck in these stores because i bet you wouldn't say  to these cracker ass  over here it was like me and three other white dudes sitting there and he gets into with this guy he keeps coming back to that point like i may wouldn't say  to these crazy ass  over here and after like the third or fourth cracking ass  we kind of start like looking at each other like dude should we not be getting offended at this point this is getting ridiculous i can literally feel the heat from his fingers he's going quick ass  somebody should do something you know what nobody did  we just sat there and took it that's what sucks about being white in that situation there's no unity there's no brothers when it comes to white people white people we are individuals we are the worst we're just like hey i don't know him  him that's his problem i do not give a  long as i get where i'm going this right here isn't happening this here is happening from here over i'm from here to here and here here i'm in this i'm in this right here and that that's all that's over there this  somebody somebody got a point i think one black guy could walk up to four white dudes start beating the crap out of one of them now the three white twos we're not gonna do  we'll be like oh hey must have said something i don't wanna get involved movie starts in five minutes hey whatever  him that  doesn't work both ways i get no fight with a black guy even if he's winning the fight half the neighborhood still shows up and helps out give a fight of black guys don't believe it you start with him and then it's his crew and people running out of buildings it's like braveheart there's like waves of black people coming over the hill it's this big community effort   is unbelievable people i got called a cracker for  18 stops there's like 30 other white people on the train they didn't even look up from their newspapers and anything they're probably giving the other dude the benefit of the doubt like well he probably grew up in a rough neighborhood he's having a bad day and even though he's calling us crackers it's not us per se it's more society as a whole that he has difficulty with and we need to understand that  was unbelievable  crackers cracker ass   finger right in my face  was ridiculous i'd say that's funny when someone gets racial with you when you're white because you're not allowed to get racial back it's against the rules you can't do the  so it's like awkward it's like the other dude's going i  taco you  white boy you're like you  jerk no you can't do it because the second you get racial when you're white then all of a sudden they wheel out that podium and they have like the press conference you know what i mean you gotta be standing on i uh disgrace the i'd like to company to all the members of my family i just like to stay for the record there was no air conditioning on the subway i wasn't thinking clearly i took some cold medications i just like to apologize i i had nothing against mexicans i went to tijuana i had a great time please i need this job please don't do this  just he  up he's just up there begging for his job please get a mortgage that's not why dudes we get uptight sometimes now we get nervous in those situations because with political correctness you're not even trying to say some  that podium can come out of nowhere you're not even treated like yeah i think i'm getting a shirt oh what shirt on the black shirt what the  did you say i said black shirt i should have said african-american shirt i apologize i meant no offense to anybody please please i'm already two months behind on my rent please don't do this please oh  they got me you ever seen that like the dude is always like the white dude behind the podium always thinks he's going to get his job back too that's what kills me the  is over if you're white and the second you get behind that podium the  is over whether you did it or not white people have done so much evil  somebody's got to go down once every six months the machine got to eat one white dude spit them out whether he did this  or not so it's just like dude stop crying just pack your  up disassemble your cubicle cause you're going home grow a mustache come back in six months maybe we can work it we can work it back through have you ever seen that  though do you ever feel uh the tension when somebody white like i'll tell you what's what's always awkward did you guys watch out venus and serena play each other in the u.s open a couple months back you know what's funny about that  anytime like black people do some new  white people always got to talk about it and no matter how hard they try to like compliment it always comes off as  up it was kind of like i don't know i don't know about that what the  did he mean like you know i realized watching that  it's really difficult for somebody white to say somebody black is intelligent without it coming off like well why why did he he didn't say andre i guess he was intelligent while i was done he's just saying this  like i'm sitting there watching i swear to god dickenberg says she's watching it great game all you gotta do is just shut the  up say the score get in get out you still got your job everything's cool then all of a sudden in the middle of it all of a sudden just goes for no reason let's go yeah venus and serena they're uh two very uh very bright um bright young ladies and you can literally feel the other two white dudes in the booth just being like all right buddy you're on your own  whatever i don't know where you're going with this  but i want no part of that they're like dusting off the podium dick enberg's like oh  somebody go to commercial why did i start this he's sitting there going y'all you could sit down with them and have a conversation about a wide variety of topics please please go to commercial i'm just waiting for the guy to be like you could be doing a crossword puzzle and maybe serena could help with number eight it's like what are you talking about dick just say the  score i gotta you

jesus christ these  guys talking about me what are you talking about you saved him he had nothing why do you guys have uh matching his and her earrings that's kind of bizarre do you have like the same  thing all right i'm gonna like link those things together we're gay pirates all aboard i'm just  hey it's either you don't see that you only dude relax i don't need  some 43 year old guy in a checkered shirt to come jumping up on the stage that's like the  word like what do you do what do i do with that one he's gonna jump up here throwing his back and then  sue me he provoked it your honor i was all i was all tensed up and i still i had to defend my honor have one of those  lawsuits about nothing yes this is the  i was doing before i came down and talked about stress i had my grandmother staying with me 95 years old coming yeah 95 still going you get that old man you stop becoming like a kid again can't do  she was driving me nuts all  week i'd be sitting there in silence

got to press it down grandma okay tension is building say shut the  up on off everything's got on and off you want it to work you're flipping on  so  got real tense though towards the end because she wanted she want to meet my girlfriend right her girlfriend's black grandmother's wife obviously  i didn't realize my grandmother she's like she's old school white i didn't i kind of forgot she was like born in 1907. you know what i'm saying something is new york no big deal yeah it should be here  i showed her the picture i'm like i'm gonna meet her that's a picture isn't she cute and she just goes like i'm like what what's the matter she just she didn't say nothing i swear to god and then like two hours later she's sitting on the couch it's like bugging her and she's just like you know i could i could never live with you because your views on the world are just you know i don't know she's like beating around the bush because she's a republican i'm like what you know i don't like george bush is at it she's like you know like what are you talking like my girl she's like yeah that's what you know exactly what i'm talking about i'm like what's the problem it's 2002 there's no

what's that  what is   one what those dudes doesn't understand you're doing a character he thinks that i'm saying that  was my grandmother saying that  is that what he's just uh-huh let me change the subject it's my  act i'll talk about what the  i want to talk about like i'm a  jukebox or something up here  that's really irritating because i was about ready to change the subject now i feel like i can't jesus christ see it's all smelling that urine all day it makes people angry his face is just rocky wouldn't say any  like that time is flying by here all right ignoring the people to the right just plowing ahead getting into my own comedy zone blocking it out i was watching on the oprah winfrey show the other night is this subject okay with you fantastic i'm just gonna clear every subject with you for the rest of the  way this subject is okay this one is not you will just come up here and beat the  out of me that's a difficult thing too when a woman comes at you that's a  up situation when a woman comes out  why is it why isn't it  up huh what what happened it was all peace and love and harmony huh oh the knock around yeah that's right that  never works so it doesn't work then it's i'm telling you that situation it's like  kryptonite it's a comedy show right it was a comedy show and all of a sudden the crowd is heckling itself at this point yo you tell table 22 the table 26 says shut the  up i don't know what's going on i didn't want it to be like this i didn't want it to be like this i just wanted to tell some jokes make a little money have a good time eat a cheesesteak a

out some holy water something good god almighty it's always the late show it's always a late show people get a little  get  crazy anywho so i'm watching the oprah winfrey show i like watching that show because i like watching a guest because your guests are idiots you know what kills me about that show every night oprah is examining marriages and she's never been married and no one ever brings that  up they just listen to her no one ever goes wait a second oprah you've never been married so you don't know what the  you're talking about and what kills me is the guy is always wrong every time the examiner mathematically that doesn't work out at least once the dude has to be right you know what i mean never the woman is always like totally innocent like i was just trying to make him some chocolate chip cookies and he didn't think there was enough chocolate chips in the cookies so he started beating me with the cookie pan it was horrible then the guy's like always the biggest  everyone what the  the one's  cookie you did not talk to chip look i'm not saying guys aren't jerks i'm a good example of it women can be jerks too like you know a group of women i always wanted them to expose with those 24 25 year old gorgeous women who hook up and marry like a 80 year old rich guy you ever seen that the billionaire like  old dude walking around this young hottie now the girl just came out

drunk and she told me she told me she touched one of the strippers dicks right she kind of put that in like the sandwich in the middle of something hey how was your day by the way i touched dick and

stick that's twice as big as mine so once down is equal to down and then back up again on me so i had her once in my life i'm in an argument with the woman i'm 100 in the right and i still lost the fight you know why because she cried i had her on the ropes all of a sudden she started crying next thing you know i feel like a bully and now next thing you know i'm apologizing because she touched a dick  genius and the thing was i wasn't sorry i just wanted to stop crying because i felt like an  i'll tell you what kills me too is i've been totally faithful with this girl and there's a girl around the corner i know wants to hook up with me and i've stayed away stayed away in the second she said that  i don't know what happened i didn't think it up here it came up here all right i should

most concerned person ever that guy is rubbing excuse me what's wrong with your hands sir i hope everything is okay if there's anything can i get you something there's a pharmacy only a block away i got a computer man that's like the biggest thing in my life now i'm trying to get good at that  i came up we just had like typewriters and  like that you know what i'm saying i'm like an idiot now eight years ago i was a semi-intelligent person i'm like a   it's like every button i hit on my computer my computer has to like shut down restart you ever get that  regroup somehow deal with my idiocy then it's always like some eight-year-old kid on a computer next to me he's like breaking into the pentagon downloading movies getting a plane ticket for six bucks how the  do you do that i'll tell you the only thing i like about my computer is i really enjoy spell check you know you know what i like about you i like about spell check you don't have to be close to getting the word right have you ever noticed that  all you got to do is just get it like somewhere like within the ballpark of the word it's almost like your computer could just start guessing like yeah  i don't know uh dinosaur you know when you're sitting there like an idiot like nah i wasn't trying to spell dinosaur so now what does your computer do it starts throwing out like every d word it can possibly think of like okay how about dictionary diary any of this  looking familiar are we moving towards the goal or away from it you ever spell a word so bad though your spell check has absolutely no clue what the  you're trying to spell what do you end up getting i'm getting like a question mark you got a million dollars worth of technology just looking back at you like just like you got me buddy which is pretty amazing because i have all the words yeah and that doesn't look like any of them i can't even make a guess that's so  up would you like pass out and whack your head off the keyboard please tell me you're not that stupid i am i'm the worst i was sick too i was sick all through september three weeks i was sick man i didn't take any medicine though because i don't trust the  anymore i'm paranoid man i've noticed over the last couple of years any new medicine that they advertise on tv the last 20 seconds of the commercials just totally psycho side effects to whatever they're trying to advertise you'll notice that  and they always try to slide it in real quick too like it's no big deal just like yeah it cures your headache everything's great then your ear falls off you can't feel your feet and you won't recognize your mother 40 of the people were bleeding from the ass and one guy thought he was a pigeon i'm not even exaggerating that bad i saw this  the other night right it's mostly cure like stomach ass end of the commercial the three side effects were migraine headaches abdominal pain and diarrhea who the hell would try that  you basically try that  you go from like one problem to three you're just walking away like how's your stomach ass it's great  never felt better no diarrhea is not a side effect that is a major goddamn problem all right where i'm from the evening is over what are there actually people out there like oh this little diarrhea don't worry i'm just going to kind of slam my ass cheek shut i'll be all right actually diarrhea is the least of my problems at this point it's helping to take my mind off the migraine headache and the knifing abdominal pain in my stomach dude you don't try anything that causes diarrhea diarrhea is evil that is basically your body going you know what you have something so foul within your system we can't wait for the normal process of elimination we have to get rid of that  right now but dude i'm still on the bus  it now you have some evil in your ass and it has got to go immediately we must override all do not  your pants systems because you sir have a storm brewing all right my name is bill burr you guys are a lot of fun thank you very much how do you get my  together man i'm  36 i'm not married you know what i mean she's  i'm at the age where everybody knows getting married you know let me see a question why the  do people keep getting married you know what i mean isn't anybody looking at the stats what's it like half the marriages are going right down the  right people if you were going skydiving and they told you 50 of these parachutes weren't gonna open you're like yo  that i'm not going i don't like those thoughts i got a 50 chance of splatting on the ground i'm not doing it but there's something about getting married people just have to do it they're just like is this the line to lose half my  awesome this is gonna be great i can't wait to lose my car my money this is gonna be amazing look the line is moving one step closer to losing everything i've worked for no i just talk to married guys and they scare me anytime you ask a married guy what's it like being married they always tell you it's good but they have a look on their face like they have like an appendicitis so it's confusing you're like dude what's it like being married like you know it's good it's good no no no no it's good it's uh you know it's a lot of work but uh you know what's good you know you know when you meet that special someone it's definitely i can't feel my legs it's enjoyable you can just fix your battles very dudes are pathetic married guys whisper in their own house you haven't noticed that  it's their own  hat they paid for half of it right and they whisper talk normal until you ask them to do some fun  you know what i mean like hey how's it going like yeah what's up you know that  hey you want to go to the next game on tuesday yeah okay but i just i just kind of asked that  terrified that's what all becomes terrified you're terrified to get your woman in a bad mood because you know what's going to happen she's going to cut off the sex that's what they do they have some  they never talk about on oprah right they always nobody's exposed guys for the  that we are but they never talk about that  that's how they run the relationship they they  they ration out the  you stay in a relationship long enough guarantee sex will become like a reward you know what i mean like you took out the trash you're a good boy training it like a goddamn seal  terrorist holding the  hostage that's exactly what they're doing but i'm like this country i do not respond to terrorist threats i'll  rub one out in a minute you take out the goddamn trash you are useless to me for the next 12 minutes i'm in the bubble baby because of that three minutes of material i never get laid after my show right there is the exact opposite thing i'm supposed to be doing up here people it's closely up here kissing women's asses you know like most comics getting up here going give it up for the ladies don't the ladies look fine tonight ladies give it up for yourselves so coming out to this club looking so fine making this fine ass  club in the finer  that so anyways i'm dating this girl right this girl's like really into like women's issues so she gets me this book on women's live right and i'm reading this  right it's really interesting man i think women's live was a great thing definitely necessary i think it was totally cool back in the 70s you know i gotta admit over the last couple years i think that woman's movement is starting to morph into kind of like that reverse kind of pimping kind of thing you know so every time you see women on tv they say all we want is to be treated exactly like guys what sounds cool but if you listen to them they don't they only want the good  of being a guy you haven't noticed that they're cherry-picking they look at a guy's life like it's like a buffet like you just can start picking out  like same amount an hour we'll take some of that pay for the movie  that you can keep that one i don't like that one i don't like that one at all this is nice that's yucky that's icky  come on man you can't choose this girl gave me  one night she goes why does a guy make more an hour to do the exact same job i'll tell you why because in the unlikely event that we're both on a titanic and it starts to sink for some  up reason you get to leave with the kids and i have to stay that's why i get the dollar board out no if there's a house fire it's always women and children first i gotta stand there with like the back of my shirt on fire going let's go people let's go let's go so that's how i look at it no it's a dollar an hour surcharge that if something  up happens either i can't leave or i gotta like get in the way of it to give you a head start you know like rabbit dog run honey one mississippi two mississippi you hear a bump in the night i gotta go check it out like yes he does have a knife anytime there's a hostage situation who do they negotiate for first well at least let the women and children go what about me you think i want to stay in the vault with those 20 other sweaty guys praying to god that i'm not the hostage who gets dragged out in front of the bank by that psycho as he starts asking the cops for a helicopter that i know he's not going to get right they never get their helicopter so now i got to try to convince this guy with like a 38 to my head going dude that's for a rent-a-car i think they'll go for a rent-a-cop see what i'm saying where are all those feminists in those situations you can't find them there are no feminists in a house fire that's a  guarantee you can take the most hardcore feminists right some chick right in your face you show me six out of events you know a little short little haircut the whole nine yards right second those flames break out she's gonna twist those little hairs in the pigtails ooh just the girl i want to go play jump rope and leave you standing in a burning house like you're not flammable people i'm not a dick though no i'm not i'm not saying i think a woman should make a dollar less than an hour to do the same job i think that's  up all i'm saying is if you're going to make what i make when the boat sinks you better be standing right there next to me listen to that guy play the cello then you get the corner office i don't get that  why why do drowning sucks equally for a man or woman that's just some horrific  you know my dick isn't like a periscope that i can stick up from under the water as i start going down do you guys like that movie the titanic did you find it romantic i dated this girl she thought it was romantic that  really pissed me off that's a really romantic movie don't you think no it's a  horror film and she's like why i'm like why because all the guys died see you're watching the  going who would i be in that situation you'd be that chick floating away in the big piece of luggage i'm watching it going who would i be i'd be that dude when like the boat breaks in half that dude who like falls straight down and bangs off the  and goes into the water that's who i'd be i'd be wearing a tuxedo not cause i wanted to but she wanted to dress up that night right and i'd just be falling the whole way down i should have  that chicken    first so i go on the internet a lot that's how i feel my evenings when i'm on the road i like going to the internet man i like going to jail  you everyone like a chat room whatever people are talking about you ever go in there and just start  with the people in the chat room just pick a couple of people whatever they say you try to say the exact opposite  and just try to see like how many people you can like piss off and get to write back to you in like capital letters so like you know they're yelling at you like no you shut the  up oh it's great it's one of the easiest things to do especially now like all this politics in the air just going to any any politicians website and just start talking  about the candidate you know by going to a john kerry website and say look looks like i got like a  wooden indian holding cigars up for a train post well going to george bush if you did anyone  with him go i went in there the other night right everyone's down with bush in there talking about how great he is so i just leave this big ridiculous post like leave saddam alone right i got like 30 emails why don't you get the  out of the country your liberal son of a   like you oh and you just can get him going i just got one i really don't think he's that bad of a guy oh that's what i love about the internet i just love how he can just piss off some dude in the middle of nowhere you know he's taking it all serious like pacing in front of his computer he's in his underwear drooling spraining his index fingers   i'll tell you something else man there's a lot of racists on the internet you haven't noticed that  i swear to god man i don't give a  what chat room you're going to somebody's writing something  up you know you be like the most basic chat one like what do you like better peas or carrots some are like black should go back to africa and all this crazy  then people start arguing with each other right i saw this black and this white dude killing each other the other night right the black dude writes ah you white guys are just mad because the black guys are out there  all the white women right and then he writes and you know it's true and he wrote in capital letters he underlined the  and he had like exclamation points at the end of it so evidently not only was this guy yelling he must have been like standing on his computer chair pointing at the screen and you know it's true so then the white dude writes back he's like ah that's  you're just  all the fat white ones who are on welfare right oh shut up you politically correct  you all would have laughed at that  if you were home alone by yourself stop groaning because you see some black people here you all would have laughed you would have downloaded it you would have put it on your refrigerator you bunch of phonies oh geez so anyway so then this white girl writes in right she's like that's not true she's like i'm five foot two i'm white i'm gorgeous and i only have sex with black guys because i can't deal with white guys with their bigotry and their racism right so i'd email this girl back right i'll just like yeah lady i just want to make sure you didn't like dislocate your elbow when you were like patting yourself on the back with that look what what a great person i am self-serving horseshit email you just sent you know what i mean cause that is  people how do you tie like a social or like a political opinion into who you like the  you know what i mean how do you make those two things come together like what was i really realistically supposed to say to her like good luck with your continued fight against racism as you ride black  p.s i only have sex with puerto rican girls because i am sick of world hunger now you see that i'm not like you guys i get involved i cannot sit back and do nothing that's what i do anytime i see a problem i pick a race of women i start  them until the prom goes away because i give a  every vote counts people in fact until they fix that hole in the ozone layer it's strictly asians i'm going to chinatown i'm going to start  banging away because i care about the environment people it's not about me and an asian fetish it's none of that  it's about the environment i'm worried about the spotted owl i have a cause with my sexual activity i uh i've seen this girl right this black girl lives up in harlem we've gone out like three four times right first couple times we hung out hung out down the village which is sort of a racially mixed area and then we hung out and  actually then we head out here you guys cheer for the oddest   down it's just so i was weird down the street about the street i've done that  right left right just keep walking it's awesome i can relate to you so the second time we hung out we hung out like midtown right so you know sorry racially mixed third time third time right we'll see how he likes this  third time she calls me she wants me she wants me she calls me like 3 30 in the morning she wants me to go up to her apartment right so it's 3 30 in the morning she lives in harlem i look how i look so it's a  situation because i don't know if you guys know the deal basically a white dude in new york feels comfortable up to about 98 99th street right second the streets start getting into like triple digits you know all of a sudden you start having like difficulty breathing 101st streak getting a little asthma like yeah  it's gonna chest it's getting a little tight you're feeling that tightness 106th street you're like leaning on  dude where'd all the cabs go how come there's no taxis i don't like this   so she tells me to go to the uptown 2-3 subway right and i'm praying to god that she's going to tell me to get off like 103rd street which is basically the first step into harlem you know the first stop where i can still look over my shoulder and like see the white people like disappearing over the horizon you know so i'm praying for 103rd street but she goes you want to get off at 125th street like ah  125th street jesus christ that's like right in the middle of everything i'll be surrounded on all four sides i can't do this so at this point i'm really trying to hide like the  tone that's starting to creep into my voice so i just start asking like really specific directions for when i get off the train because i'm gonna know like exactly where i'm going when i get off the train i don't be you know taking any wrong turns meeting people going after parties  that i'm gonna go from the train to her apartment right so i'm like all right when i get off the train do i go right do i go left what am i doing she's like all right when you get up training and she starts giving me directions right and every street she's naming up there is like named after like a black leader you know she's like make a left on adam clayton take a right on frederick douglass i'm like god  clayton y'all dude go on the internet look at madame clayton did he kill a bunch of white people during a slave revolt i can't do this ain't going up there until you know what i haven't played to  this  so at this point i'm really having a battle with myself because i'm thinking i can't do this you know i'm like i can't do this but my dick's going no come on man we can do this all right just relax pull yourself together and get on the goddamn train right so as always i listen to my deck right oh yeah so i get on the train by the time i get up there it's like five or four in the morning right i'm standing on like malcolm x and like danny glover or some  right i don't even know where the hell i'm at just trying to figure out where i'm going so i see the street i want to go up i want to go up saint nick right i can literally see your apartment building but there's like five or six black dudes standing right on the corner right where i want to walk by so i'm like  this point i felt like i was on like some sort of reality show like some sort of white guy survivor you know it's just one obstacle after another so i'm like i gotta walk by this guy there's nothing i can do i just i gotta walk right by these guys and i was scared shitless but you know what i'd actually think i think that they were a little more surprised to see me then i was scared you know and make no mistake i was really really  scared but i'm also really really white like like shockingly caucasian you know what i mean no seriously like like if you're not ready for it i can surprise you you're not like prepared when i come walking around the corner it's almost like magical like like a leprechaun showed up or some  i should have had like a little pot of gold and like a rainbow my hand popping the moon until you're lacking all right listen my name's bill burr you guys are a lot of fun thanks very much you

retired or got held captive by some people who got control of his money whatever whatever you want to believe happened to him but all I know is he's done with sweaty fat people on cruises you know we're in West Hollywood right now can you think of a sadder third chapter to your gay life and to be on a  cruise ship with a bunch of fat straight old people trying to get him to sweat to the oldies what  respectful gay man dances around a Bill Haley in the comments it doesn't happen how can you roofie a curious teen  with a one two three o'clock that's not what you do this is you into this the sexual assault are you saying all gay men sexually assault people no oh but some of them do and that is true Progressive thought realizing that there's creeps with dicks in all gender  whatever you're supposed to say whatever the  you're supposed to say you know what's funny right now is watching the hardcore left walking away from their hard coordiness you know after they  took out so many innocent people now they're doing their new thing it's like nobody got canceled what are you talking about oh God another old person saying we can't even say this it's like no you did do that you did do that you   right that is what happened that is what happened right it all happened we all rollerbladed we all told people they had to get vaccinated and liberal left people flipped out if he didn't say they and they tried to  end you that's what they did that is what they did now they're like what are you talking about like your parents right when you go home for Christmas and you're like you

it's gonna be weird when your parents die right and you don't even cry you know you just feel more like it was like an old roommate that you lost touch with it's like an old roommate who has an old roommate that whatever how to ride a bike they didn't if you have bad parents they didn't do that either so when they die it's just sort of weird like oh yeah whatever happened to that guy ha we're here at the Troubadour how about a round of applause for this legendary venue Elton John took a  and that actual toilet up there that's how we came up with that album title whatever that was called Brown Derby in the  choo choo train going up your buttocks what did he call it I saw him when I was in Vegas it was  amazing the guy came out had no opener played like three hours of nothing but number one hits right but after at the end of every song but he does because he's so  old now and he can't do anything he just he just you know the piano whatever that  doorway is that trap door on top of the piano I'm not an audio file I don't know what the  it's for what he would do at the end of the song he'd  you know and it's Saturday night by that Danny  ended he would just slam it down and then he  stared the Mean Mug the crowd and everything  Elton John man and I was like why is he keep doing that and then I saw him walking and I was like oh that's why that's why no actually what happened was I went into John Varvatos because that's what you know any dad any old dad that's where you shop of a certain age that sort of has a punch you know but doesn't think they're that fat right you go when you buy a cool shirt they had a picture in there of him in the 70s and he was literally slamming down his hands on the piano and his feet were all the way behind his head and he was wearing like four inch like wooden clogs before slamming down on his  hips and I was like oh that's what happened he did that for three decades on coke and that's why he now walks like he used to be a fullback on the Steelers this guy coming back you know and I'll say that's a that's a compliment to him all right when you play piano and at the end of all of it you walk like Earl Campbell I knew that wasn't going to land as hard as I wanted to right who was Earl Campbell he was two and a half Bo Jackson's like welded together anyway so I wore my jean jacket here because this is what you do when you're a man of a certain age and you're going out to a rock venue I'm gonna wear my jean jacket so people know that I'm Still rocking you know I'm gonna stop short of putting my favorite band things on it because then it becomes sad it becomes like really like a uh a sad thing um speaking of said this is like one of these these  benches that's perfect for a homeless guy to lay down on you know what I mean and you get mad when you show up like God damn it I wanted to sit down and they're always sitting there like you ever just have like a   week and you hate your life and you don't love the person that you're with anymore but too many holidays are coming up and you can't break up with them you know maybe they have like a birthday and you just gotta go through the motions again as you're staring at that blank part of the card trying to write down emotions you don't feel anymore and all you laid down right all you want to do is  lay down and then you come up and they always you just see that  homeless guy just laying there like the middle of the day on like a Tuesday and you pull up in your Acura with the special sports package all the trappings of a  cubicle right and you just look over and I'm going like  I'd love to do that right now you know that's when your life sucks when a homeless guy on a Tuesday afternoon can make it look good like what if I just tapped out of society you know I'm sure I could find an off ramp that there's not another homeless guy yet that seems to be where you make your money the off-ramps the longest red light in La the off-ramp of the 101. someone just sits there he's looking at you a dog's looking at you occasionally there's a baby and you're like all I got to 20. it's like I don't I care like five dollars I don't care twenty dollars this could get me a gallon and a half of gas thank you Joe Biden I love how people still blame ties for gas prices and not the fact that we print a trillion dollars with nothing behind it every August liberals this is  Donald Trump oh is that what it is I thought it was ten  in the Federal Reserve with suits right did somebody explain to me why the president just doesn't send the Army over there with guns and walk in and be like yeah this is over this is over we don't owe you any money you guys can all go  yourselves and it's our currency again and we say it's worth something all right you guys left me on that what are you all economists well that's actually not how it works what you got to have is you need a valuable metal but what gives gold value excellent question let's go to the  Blackboard that's when you know you're in deep  when you ought to take that required economic class and the  guys all excited about it he's literally sounds like he's speaking a different language he's like there's no way I'm gonna pass this class right I have a better chance of banging the hottest chick in this class than I do of getting any sort of respectable  grade um sorry I'm in a mood my shoulders  up again went right back to square you know it happens you know I was  rubbing one out I got into it Mike I used a lotion my hand flew off my dick and it just felt like lightning you know what I mean like balls of blue my  shoulder hurts this is what it is they don't make an icy hot for that do they  Icy Hot is that the dumbest  thing ever there's so much  out there all it does is just numb it and then you'd go where's away those guys are drug dealers I need another Icy Hot I can I can feel the pain in my back again have you ever thought about maybe getting a massage you dumb  you guys don't like massages huh is it too gay for you I hate when somebody asks me you know like my masseuse unfortunately passed away the great Diana Linden um and uh so I've been looking for a new one right so I'm calling up my agent because they represent all these fancy  people so I'm like all right fancy people like massages who do you got and the guy sends me the email back he goes well you got some people do you prefer a man or a woman right it's like ah Jesus Christ what the  do you think of course a woman laughs no get me some hairy bald guy with  hair coming out of his ears right exactly you want a woman to touch you and then you know you can think in your head maybe she likes me you know maybe there's there's something else at the end of it it never happens right but it's the hope I like to have hope throwing up during a massage not horror right not the Travolta ending you know I want the uh not to say there's anything wrong you know what's funny I was coming down here the other day and uh there was you know some you know gay bar down there total sausage fest right and they had him like  boxed in there was nobody on the sidewalk there was like 80 gay guys all just standing like this inside this  thing evidently that's the place to play Pink yeah I was riding with my wife I go look old  and fever is his  Jam tonight if I ran a gay bar that's what it would be called  and fevers my Bugs Bunny fan I don't know what um hello around the world huh no no the camera's not shoe you self-involved Hollywood people with your hot tubs up there banging babies and drinking the blood so you can stay younger that's what the rest of the world thinks they're all like that's what they're doing you know what else I heard laughs what's going on Mainland China risking your freedom to watch this ignorance how are you no I get people from mainland China how's it going with dreams a hop in the fence and going to Hong Kong right do they have the Beijing wall or something like that over there I don't know I grew up in American public schools they didn't teach me that stuff they only taught me about the powdered wigs people and that's why I think black people are prone to violence and never assimilated I love when white people say that oh they're prone to  place if you ever  on your own just read about 1865 to about 1892 the accomplishments of black people and then it'll kind of flip the whole  thing around oh it got serious serious in here how do I get out of that let's talk about I hate when people interview you and they go you know you get a life you get away with a lot you get away no I don't I don't get away with anything because you're you're presuming that what I'm saying is meant in a malicious way it's not true Jesus how  old do they think I am that I have I have my jean jacket on and a t-shirt I just oh my God preachers always have these they know coming through that door is the I I said any minute they're just like and Jesus Jesus wants you to have that F250 that you don't even need he wants you to have it he wants you to pay me all in cash so I I don't have to claim most of it um anyways I don't know why I've been thinking about this lately is there anything funnier than watching somebody kick a little dog and watch it just go flying across the  room I don't mean like an innocent little dog that was just laying there stunning itself like a homeless man on a bench I don't mean that I mean like an  that doesn't realize how little it is I had a dog like that we used to always have West Highland Terriers when I was a kid we had one that  bit everybody even us you know because we used to tease the  out of it we used to just  we used to play the glove game and  yeah face wash it I know hey it was the 80s this is what  did you got a pet to take out your frustration from the lack of love you're receiving from everyone around you that's what happened maybe if we were loved more we would have pet the dog rather than coming at him with a wiffle ball bat giving him a  jab like he was on some sign a terrier Death March right so this thing you know this thing whenever a stranger came into the house without question it just went up and bit him because it was like well if these people who are supposed to be loving me and are taking care of me are acting like it's the NHL playoffs giving me a face wash every day what the  is this complete stranger gonna do so the  dog would just you know I had to like we had to like lock it up this little carry-on one time my buddy showed up we were going to uh some Bruins game or something he came in I remember he had the  short Larry Bird shorts with the  socks up to here and like white Reeboks and he just came walking in and my dog just came on my buddy laziest dude ever too big beer belly like he was in his 50s never even broke stride he's like hey Birdman what's up he just just hunt the thing and the dog literally like frisbied across the kitchen and landed and had to like regroup you know and it was still barking like but it wasn't charging anymore it was great it was like seeing the day the hot chick realizes she's not hot anymore and now she has to  do the work of developing a personality like oh how do you do that right and most of them don't they don't develop a personality they get BOTOX and they go right to a steakhouse they try to find some old guy in his 80s with a pocket square and a blue blazer and they're like I'll  that for the last eight months of his life I'll work my way into the will right I don't want to work if I wanted to work I'd have all original parts right rather than these aftermarket titties you know and this Brazilian butt lift at some point I am going to  talk about uh what am I I'm gonna talk about Universe let me talk about Universal okay for those of you around the world out here in LA we have there's two theme parks okay you have Disney World land right which is the one you want to go to all right they know I'm going to sit down for this so you guys know that this is coming from the heart okay plus also I have to wipe my brow because I just took Jesus wants you to go to Disneyland the devil the devil is in universal my manager is here right now don't trash Universal don't trying to still trying to sell the movie well Till's still trying to sell that movie um this is actually a terrible couch it's very slick and it's shallow this is it's actually depressing you know like you're slowly getting older going into the  ground um or maybe it's my posture so anyway Universal it's it's like they make they're making  on the lot and then up top the people that go to their movies they have all of these  rides that you go on so every once in a while a new ride opens up and if you have kids your kids want to go on it so the new Mario World ride opened up and we went there and my wife my wife I don't know what she did like she always buys the VIP  she goes don't worry she goes we have the VIP you know we can just  go in and but our VIP  didn't count on the new ride they're like yeah that doesn't count like what are we talking about we paid an extra 100 bucks per ticket they're like yeah that's for the other rides you know do you remember Joe Dirt you remember that the Joe Dirt ride you can get on that shout out to David Spade the Joe Dirt ride it's a  69 super B that does a loop-de-loop you can I don't want to  go on that well you wouldn't have to stand in line there's no one in that line you  it's a  movie from 30 goddamn years ago we have the tango and cash  water ride it's it's good for that but any of this new  so we go into like Mario World and the first thing we did we got there early we stand in line for this  ride dude it was two hours and 40 minutes to get on the  ride dude every time you thought you'd gone up the last flight of stairs and gone into the last room they had and there was no Refreshments no nothing so people are getting dehydrated and then they keep bringing you outside of the structure and I'm going on you know this is one of those fights you don't want to have with your wife in that line because there's no you can't walk away right you just standing there you don't want to start anything and I'm just sitting there thinking like why the  didn't you get the  goddamn  you know you always know where the best  is how did you  this up right I was like the dad and Poltergeist you know you moved the gravestones but you didn't move the bodies why that's what I wanted to do you got VIP tickets but it didn't count on this  right so two hours and 40  minutes standing in line it was so bad in the beginning I actually I felt for everyone around me going like how can you do this to these hard-working Americans this is  terrible to run a business like this people come here they're with their kids people are crying dude is this like a recycled couch was this made out of like plastic bottles or something by some hipsters in Silver Lake um it's made out of tents from tent cities and then we got them we got them new  yeah so stand in line going like how the  can you  do this to people this is what within an hour of this I was I just hated everybody and I was like you know what these  people deserve it look at it bunch of fat  standing here   in front of me they cut us they did this thing where they were like they sort of like saw how long the line was and they'll say it was like going all the way that way they sort of got to like you know it was like you know only like five or ten groups of people and they kind of went like is that the lawn is that is that like is that like the line and then they were just  in it and like that was like an hour of my life going why didn't I say anything you know I didn't say anything because they all outweighed Me by at least 120 pounds yeah morbidly morbidly obese in their 20s Prime of their life you know should be running down the beach like they're in Baywatch carrying that little thing whatever that thing was for like what was that thing football I'm in the ocean that's what I'm gonna hang on to you're gonna put in your teeth and teeth and  heavy fake 90s titties like we're not going to go down to the ground you might as well put cement shoes here right so we finally get into like this room they're like okay everybody ready to  do it and they bring us like a whole group of us they're like come on everybody I see space I see see space keep walking in all right we're looking at trash compactor thing from the movie you guys like right the  Star Wars right yeah  yeah buddy  Star Wars man  live long with Chewbacca in your buck Roger Beady Beady  right so there will be one person that comes up oh that's Star Trek they do that in Star Trek all right Star Trek has made the force be with you right is that how you do it oh wait that's Hitler it's hard it's hard to keep them all keep track of all of them um  you know that's an expression in my house when like you're not dealing with the issue when you're not actually dealing with the issue at hand and you're trying to argue something else there's an expression in my house so you know what you're doing right now you're defending Hitler's mustache what Charlie Chaplin had it WC Fields just ignoring these six million Jews that were killed let's make this about the mustache it was in style uh Reginald Van Gleason had a longer version of it um so anyway we get into the  trash compactor room and then we're standing and the door closes behind us and there's no  ride so now it's like claustrophobic we're in there with all of these people right I can't believe like cargo pants are coming back again all right is that really going to be a thing it is okay I survived him in the 90s you're never going to use all those Pockets I'm just letting you know there's never gonna be a reason even with your vape pens and your  weed there's going to be no reason to have all of those pockets all right you're not going on Safari right yeah commandeering some indigenous people to Lead You Through the Jungle right now that you need their help you see them as human beings afterwards you'll leave and you're content to have them make your sneakers for the rest of your lives oh the groanies showed up today it's about me I just feel feelings I just I feel them you know when someone else is in pain I feel their pain but I continue to buy those sneakers but I do feel bad I feel bad about what is going on so we get in this  room and then this poor woman right she's got like the uh the drive-through the drive-through microphone she's like all right everybody's in okay and we've been waiting for two hours and 40 minutes and she has the  balls to go all right you guys ready to ride the Super Mario ride and the parents are like yeah yes we are that was the entire purpose of this exercise and you know the deal when somebody says are you ready no matter how much you say you're ready it's never enough right so we're standing there she's like oh come on this is the Super Mario ride you could do better are you ready to ride the Super Mario ride and everybody's like with the last bit of  hydration we have in our body we're like yeah yes we are tell me where the dick is and I will suck it please let this part of my life end Mike and then guess what happens nothing cause the ride has not arrived on the other side so now she has to filler bust and she's not good at it going like this ride took over 75  hours to whatever the  she was saying and then it ends and she starts again all right I hear it and she's like are you guys ready I remember there was this giant guy with this head that weighed as much as my body and I could see him standing over everybody and he was I just saw the side of his face in the complete lack of synapses firing and he's like squinting and she was going like are you  ready are you ready to get in the  Mario right and he was just like he just opened his mouth and exhaled was like  right and then she did it and she had the balls the  cojones to do it again and finally this one dead who the only person with self-esteem less just went like yeah we've been waiting for two and a half  hours right he didn't say  and she had the balls to be like what and he goes we've been waiting for two and a half hours and I hated myself that I didn't say yeah exactly what do you think we're doing here this is a horrible experience not worth the wait we realized that an hour and 10 minutes in but there was no way to get out we were just surrounded and there was metal on both sides it was like the Ron Burgundy I'm trapped in a glass house of emotion so finally we get in there we go into another  room they closed the door and this  guy's talk I can't at this point I don't even remember what happened then we went to the final last thing it's like okay this is what you got you got to put the thing on and then put the glasses on and then you gotta  this is shooting and all of this stuff and then we got on and it was like  three and a half minutes and the hope that's it and the whole  thing was over and we in there I couldn't tell what I was shooting at and all this type but I don't play I'm not a video game guy right you know what I mean I drank beers right I  hung out with the fellas I could throw a ball all right foreign I lived my childhood outside in reality I didn't stay inside friendless jerking off pretending I was a Navy SEAL playing siphon filter well actually I played that game um I was a video game guy for a minute I was I had one and then like I just I just it took over my life it took but fortunately I'm not good at like with electronics so one day I came home after spending the entire like last like week playing Grand Theft Auto or some  I just went I had a PlayStation 2. I just went behind it and I just  unplugged everything and I wound all the wires together and I just threw in the back of the closet I don't think I don't think I played a video game in my home ever since I'm getting off track here so the  the ride ends and we all get out and you're just sitting there going like Jesus Christ did my kid think it was worth I forgot that we went with another dad and his kid and his kid an hour and 50 minutes in was just hanging over the  banister thing and he's going this is the most boring thing ever it was like bombing and stand up for two hours and 40 straight  minutes I remember one point I was sitting up on the thing because I finally had to sit down and I was up on the top thing and I was sitting there and I saw somebody walking down dressed as Super Mario and I'm like I know this  is going to tell me to get off this  thing and I am not moving and she just came right got  on the tank could you not bring relief relief send me good time that's why I love my wife she was sitting on the lower one and I was sitting there and the dad we were with was looking at us waiting to acknowledge the authority and neither one of us did and she just kept walking because you just stopped just sit down and she never did anything and we never  moved I just took the guys like I'm not  moving what are you gonna do throw me out and end this so but here's the best part though we ended up getting out of there right um by the way I I wanted to get a coffee so I wanted a cappuccino and they have like  19 Starbucks in there and I don't drink that   it's absolute  they don't give a  about you know where those beans come from mainland China I know what you guys are up to you're trying to take us out you know that we love coffee huh we over there  with your dumplings I don't think we are I don't know where they get them but their coffee  sucks so they go oh you know you go anything other than a Starbucks and they're like we have a French Bistro around I actually believed that there was a French Bistro at the  Universal  Backdraft ride amusement and fun center right so I was like oh my God right and I go there and it's like little caffeine little  I was like oh my God I'm like so sunburned and like I'm actually believing like it's like an oasis like oh my God thank you Higher Culture let me get some cappuccino and I was like yeah can I get a cappuccino please and she goes uh she goes yeah and she grabs this giant  cup it's like this big and I'm like oh no this is gonna what is that what is that a Big Gulp cappuccino it's supposed to be this big and you do the pretty little tree thing right and then I sit down and act like I'm working on a script that's a cappuccino you don't pull out the  Marvel movie  Mountain Dew cup and I see the lady making it she's just not even looking I took two sips of it I was like they were nice they were nice enough but like the  I just remember I talked to him and they thought I was a good person and now I'm  on them it just it was terrible and I  threw it out I just like I'm trying to work on not cursing in front of my kids and we sat down at to eat a crusty burger The Simpsons part of the park and I finally like my wife's going like so do you want to go down and go on the uh the Jurassic Jurassic  Velociraptor  ride and I just I couldn't hold it anymore I go I'm  wiped I I can't I still want to do this anymore like you know if this is like the end of the relationship I'm actually I don't know if I have it in me to like save it and if you just wanna meet some other guy here with Mouse ears that has a little better attitude about this types of things like I'm sure we can work on a financial settlement but I am  I am  out of here like I can't I literally can't  do this anymore oh it's great when you leave when you leave they're like  you like you got to go all the way out this way and where all the fatties come in they got this wide berth and you just gotta walk all the way you're seeing the Shrubbery it's so bad because you can see like Civilization like oh my God look at those houses that have air conditioning and stuff you should  just walking out but the best part was we got home and like my daughter fell asleep and everything and she came in and her Nana was there and she was like how was it and she was just like it was unbelievable and she totally flipped out and everything I was like all right thank God it's always worth it so in a way that was an endorsement laughs in a way in a way that was that wasn't a door I got to make sure I don't go over you wanna go to the chat you know no no I'm not going to the chat I got this  I want to  talk about you know but we got to make sure we get it all in before people in Thailand get their feet beaten you have the nerve to enjoy your day  you are only loud it was funny there's probably someone in Thailand right now laughing their ass off but I want to say thank you for  watching um I went to a benefit last night with two two of our friends amazingly talented musicians performed at right and it was it was the American Heart Association and they were raising awareness and you know what it was called it was called the heart and stroke ball that's what they called it and somehow nobody saw it and they're up there performing and there's a  sign right to the right that says heart and strokeball and I'm like two years old so I'm sitting there stroke ball and I took a gummy so and there's this woman up there she's talking about this this horrible journey of like her kid was born with half a heart Happy Ending like the kid like survived because the American Heart Association so it was an American thing but it just kept going every time you thought she had the last operation there was another operation and it just kept getting sadder and sadder like like what was that  movie with the big chick there you know precious right it just kept you know when it just gets so  sad you just are staring at the table like oh my God this is so  sad I can't believe I  about standing in line for the Mario ride I'm such a piece of  and the gummy was kicking in and as sad as it was and as much empathy that I had I kept looking up and it said heart and strokeball and then I would start laughing and I was just like and my wife looked at me and she's going don't don't you  dare again when somebody tells you not to laugh then it just becomes like I feel like it was one of the saddest stories I've ever heard in my life and it was like it was she was like 18 minutes into this sad story and then she goes and that wasn't even the bad part and I I almost spit take I was just like let's wait and then a tree landed on her house that's why I don't believe in God that he would do that to somebody they just wanted to have a kid why would you do that to somebody they're like God loves you it's like does he what because he didn't do that to me but why did he do that to that person they're probably a better person than I am well you know God works in mysterious Now give me that   no you don't have an answer well you know what it is God God sometimes has somebody born with half a heart so their kid can go their parents can go they're supposed to experience Joy of having a kid and then they have that  thing happen to him and then they're trying to tell the story right and you want to be empathetic for them and then some   writes heart and stroke ball and  leaves it right next to him and God also made that person he made all those people that sat in that room and looked at that  side and went like yeah yeah that looks good let's have that up there trolling her the entire  time it was unbelievable one of the like the fact that the the the strength that it took that woman and that kid to go through all of that  and they didn't deserve that sign that wasn't God that was the devil the devil made the person type all of that  uh what did I want to talk about up here um Mario thing Mario ride oh we're going to the Mario movie after this that's what we're gonna go  do we were supposed to go yesterday we were supposed to go yesterday and we went in it was funny we we went to like the IMAX theater right and it had like the  you know the the reclining seats and everything our daughter's in the middle she's all amped up you know we're both excited uh you know my wife's smiling the greatest thing ever you know she's in a great mood and uh we're just staring at this this is the screen is just all green and it has these five circles on it we're looking at it the movie's supposed to start at 11 30. nothing happens 11 35 nothing happens and my wife the lovely Nia leans in she goes I think there's something wrong with the screen I'm like what are you talking about it's on you know thank you I just haven't cranked it up yet she goes no I think there's something wrong I'm like hey you're all right you know 11 40. still the green screen and then she starts going like Mike what's funny what gets my wife going yeah for me it's like  everything right like I flip out over the dumbest  you know like and I can't even think I can't because it's so dumb like I don't even like I don't even remember it you know I just you know what I do is I say really a lot you know like for some reason whenever I get in my car I have nothing in my hands and by the time I get home there's like 50 things I gotta take out I dropped the garage opener and then I just I'll scream at the top of my lungs in my car really  my wife never flips out right and she started flipping out going like you need to go out there and you need to say something and that's like what the  to who like I don't owner of this place he's in some dark room like the guy in the natural who owns the baseball team right 40-year reference nobody got it yeah I don't know what the  who am I supposed to talk to the ticket Terror like does he also run the projector and he's going to change the reel to

when the projector doesn't work but you can come on so now my daughter's upset yeah you know what I mean they want to see the movie so we gotta we gotta go back because we're maybe gonna go see the 12 o'clock one and then it became stressful and I was like no  that we'll come back tomorrow and and sit in the right theater and it'll be all be good and unfortunately my daughter wanted to get out of

sneakers to make himself look less translucent  oh bloodless bill it's always funny it's always funny well look at that look at you guys it's all turning on me the first joke some hellos from Norway Georgia Florida no way those people are  animals dude I did a show out there I don't think I've ever seen people drink like they the  Vikings they're Maniacs they  they all  there was a guy like when I was backstage I did a show in Oslo right which is a really really ritzy town I think I ever told you guys this but like back in the day Sweden conquered the lower third of Norway right and they just took this  over and they're like  you you know we're more Viking than you are all right we're  you women we're eating your food and all you guys are going up north something like that I didn't read this story but that's basically how all conquering of land happens and then you write a story like God wanted us that's the history God wanted us to have this part of it so long story short in the um in World War II Sweden remained neutral right they didn't pick a  side so that's how they became an economic power after World War II because they were actually just the fact that they were still standing so what they did was they basically looked the other way because Norway was on the side of the Allies so they looked the other way as the Nazis used their trains you know you know minding our own business  angry Hitler showing up Norway sir you went around sex I'm sick people we don't really have an opinion on it and they just let him go in there and  everybody up so at the end of the war yes Sweden became a power because they they just the fact that they were still standing in every other  city was leveled um that's why today it's a really cool City to uh to visit because all the cool old buildings are still there so long story short the  war ends in Norway is in such a bad way I forgot to say the beginning uh they somehow got the bottom third of their country back Norway did before World War II so then after Hitler went in there and did all the  he did the Germans at the end of the war Norway was so  up they offered to sell the lower third of their country back to Sweden and Sweden was just like yeah nah foreign we like the fact that you can't keep your head above water and that lower third that we wanted and you want it back so bad is now  gonna drag you under like an anchor right that's what they did here's the funny thing the Norwegians discovered oil there a whole bunch of it and they made a zillion dollars and now swedes take trains into their country and do the jobs that Norwegians don't want to do some guy in Sweden told me that he goes yes we are then sat is what happened so you know you win some you lose some V remains neutral Hitler was so complementary of our blonde hair and our blue eyes and we were like oh no you shouldn't have would you like to take a true true train into Norway kill some of those brown-haired people um you know what's funny about that part of the world everybody's like six five so you're running I was running into kids that were like 5 11 and their voice hadn't even changed yet they were like like 12 years

readers readings ah oh come on you could do better than that yeah there we go that's what the  I'm talking about I always love that you can do you can do better than that it's like well yeah we could but the first response was the honest one I I can always pretend that I'm more excited by the way this is why I have back problems this is how I sit I sit on my lower spine this is from the beginning of my life God I don't want to  do that why am I here all right Steve Jobs everybody Steve Jobs you know where the new Steve Jobs is is that laminated faced hair plug  on Twitter which one the guy who  bought it the Tesla guy ah my wife has a Tesla every time she's in the driveway and she's backing up and I just hear it sounds like there's a great day and outside that needs to get fed then I hear her pulling forward and I'm like okay good she got it in the spot no no no it's like Jesus Christ just take out the shrub already those skin cancer mobiles like why does the  windshield like go past your goddamn head like another buddy of mine has one the whole top of the car was just  opened up I think it's for um population control they're gonna try to take us out melanonin all I know is I don't know why everybody thinks that guy's amazing let me tell you right now somebody who who has like  like botox face and a hair system you're gonna look at them like yeah man this guy has the answers it's like this guy's looking in a mirror like I don't like the way I look I don't ex I reject aging I reject it um  to me he looks like space Christopher walking like you know what you go in a wax museum they're like this Christopher walking like sort of but that's not him that's what he you know that well they took away the blue checks this week and I can't even begin to tell you how much that affected my life is this bill I don't know if it is um it's like dude I'm not paying for you  Botox all right you can take that blue check and stick it right in your  hair system um I'm too real for that man I let myself go bald I did because I had alopecia I didn't have any soldiers to bring to the front and Tamer Steve Jobs everybody the original didn't really do anything turtleneck   do you know when white guys are taking credit for  that they didn't do is they wear turtlenecks and they do that you know that that  photo like they're interesting dear Billy technology tits um do you remember those iMacs that came out around the year 2000 I don't uh they were translucent oh yeah I remember those the gumball color ones and we're some were different colors the monitor had the computer was one piece and there was a handle on the back for easy lifting yeah they were the original kettlebells uh  a lot of nerds got strong one side of the body uh the reason they did this is because Steve Jobs said don't trust the computer you can't throw out the window  what does that even mean but that doesn't work like if your computer was like doing something bad to your life that's not your computer there's something beyond your computer that has accessed your computer so taking that thing and throwing it out the window doesn't end it you know that's like the end of The Exorcist when the priest is going you know possess me possess me and the devil went into them and then he jumped out the window and killed himself he didn't kill the devil he killed himself was the devil like no like like all of a sudden he was flesh and blood he wasn't I like that somebody's boozing already I love a day Drinker you know what I mean there's something there's something peaceful about that you know you  your whole life up you've accepted it you know day drinkers drink they sit there they always sit there right and they got their skinny alcoholic legs you know they got the leg crust and it's like right here and there's all these explosions of veins going down it they got that big  belly and then I've never lifted a weight in my life they just sit there the whole time right and they got their little napkin with their drink on it they just sit there going like this  there's a serenity to just knowing you lost it all there's no way to rebuild you're not getting back you're just sitting there waiting to die and then just meeting a higher power you know and before he even opens his big fat all-knowing mouth just go through it I know I know  so what are you going to do are you going to be the last person to judge me let me guess you got something to say laughs did I choose the devil is that what I did isn't the devil your creation you    are you mad at me for oh Steve Jobs  um do you remember uh those iMacs that came out around the year 2000 yeah they were translucent but don't don't trust the computer you can't throw out the window maybe that was like that made sense back then like maybe 2000 technology the feds were closing in and you're like oh  and you threw your Gumball thing out the window then like we lost a signal God damn that six months of work down the  tubes I'm gonna start a legislation no more handles on computers all right the monitor in the computer was one piece and there was a handle on the back for easy lifting that I don't trust the computer you can't get aren't you glad you never had a computer with a handle and does this redeem Steve no belt jobs in your eyes no that's like he's in sex trafficking on Epstein Island and says watch out for that 12 year old she has the clap oh oh wow my whole perception of you just  changed thank you you turtleneck  you know you can blame for Steve Jobs huh you can blame for that God yep God made him too God makes all of these  people never gets any criticism it's always the mountains and the Prairies and the ocean so blue just makes one  psycho  after another that somehow ascends to the top you know there's all these decent people well you know I don't want to tell people what to do I'll tell people how to live right where do those people go huh they go to fast food you know to try to you know ease the pain in their soul they stand in two hour and 40 minute lines at Universal to go on a three minute ride never going to get that time back you know someday I will be on my deathbed and I will think of all those times like I I you know I'm not a lying person you know these  these these these coffee shops these hot dog places right if I smoke crack if there was a line I would respect you know I'm getting soap I'm not standing behind all these  itchy  all right anger control method is it gonna help me out with my anger maybe I should is like a sort of like a therapist couch this is the leather you know that makes you feel comfortable enough to lay down with your back to somebody a stranger and just tell them about your whole life and then when I was eight my dad do you know why you have your back to them it's so like you can't see them nodding off for playing a video game every once in a while they just chime in and how did you feel about that like what did that what did that make you feel oh that's terrible all right anger control method dear Billy the red-faced rage bird I love how you guys  think that I just walk around with the level of anger that I Ascend to when I'm in performance sorry I like to dress up my once in a while I like to feel important I just realize there's a camera over here looking at my balls sorry um I like the podcast until the man's spreading remember that from the left literally told us how we could sit on a subway you know maybe if you aired out you clam every once in a while you wouldn't be  worried about how guys are  sitting I reserve the right to am to  air out my freckled speed bag every whenever the  I want to now these goddamn  Liberals are saying you can't air out your American balls in your  truck because it hurts their  precious snowflake feelings  I love that term snowflake everybody is a snowflake right you've never walked down the street and seen someone who looks exactly like you we are you know and like snow initially we're beautiful I love you saw immediately when that was going you just went oh Jesus Christ yeah and then eventually you just end up pushed to the side and some dirty snow covered in mud that's called your 30s and then it's all no sorry sorry I know I'm 32 but my trainer says my body is only 26. remember that one that was right up there with work you know you can buy a star and we'll name it after you do you remember that was one of the greatest  scams ever that'll be two hundred dollars where is it there it is that's right up there right up there his name Mikey Michaelson that's your star can you point to it one more time so when I tell my friends I can find it too this is the one that's going twinklet or twinkle twinkle no no it was the first one it's the first one all right I'll see you later some scams are just so funny you know if people just buy into it you can't get mad at it all right um you've asked if anyone has a method for getting rid of your anger um my new thing too is I just want to stop cursing in front of my kids you know Mike my kid told her best friend that um she said dad says the bad word and her friend was like really my daughter was like yeah he loves saying it and then she told that to her mom who then relayed the message back to me with my wife in a group text definitely she's cool as  and thought it was funny but you know I still got the glance foreign we went out and got coffee this morning and I made her laugh her ass off it's one of my favorite things in the world is it any better than the lovely Nia's laugh come on man it's the best it's the best well we're gonna do more of these live things or not well we're gonna at some point you know it's hard with the kids but at some point we're gonna we're gonna get her back in here I know I know most of you think she's funnier than me you   uh  you asked if anyone somebody's having a heart attack right now in a golf course and for some reason I don't know why I thought of that  you asked if anyone has a method of getting rid of your anger I have a home brewed one that I made up myself oh I love this you tape an onion to your foot um anytime you get mad it's not really the onion it's the process um although it might have been invented already all right so you're taking credit for it and like going oh maybe all right basically every time you start to get angry about  exhale all of your breath and hold it as long as you can I'm gonna do this just to freak out my wife like when she's giving me  for doing whatever I did wrong I'm still going to be like    what are you doing working on my anger the  you think I'm doing basically every time you start to get angry about  exhale all of your breath and hold it as long as you can eventually the lizard part of your brain will flood you with fear of not being able to breathe and it'll be more powerful than any other emotion listen I have a  temper but ton guy like the fact that he literally has to get it you're gonna die warning warning eat eat eat nothing matters but your next breath hahaha okay in my mind I basically said okay you   this is him talking to himself this is how angry people talk to themselves because you hate yourself okay you   if you want to freak out you have to contend with me holding my breath wait a minute I love that I love that he talks about the angry person in his brain like it's a complete stranger that's a whole all right you   there's also a lack of like uh um what do you call that um responsibility you know it's not me it's angry man in my head okay you   if you want to freak out you have to uh contend with me holding my breath it didn't fix me but I do not freak the  out over okay this doesn't work at all however once I run out of oxygen start seeing black spots I don't freak out over  anymore my heart rate doesn't Spike and I am overall more calm this feels like alone in the car maybe you could do this but you're operating a vehicle there's more to do there's more to it but I don't want to make a long email even longer I could explain the entire method but once you've passed out I don't want to  tell you what you should do after that also buy a Fitbit watch it helps to show you when your blood pressure is spiking no don't inhale and hold your breath that makes you freak out more don't inhale or hold your breath that we're back to breathing sincerely another crazy  all right well I can commend you sir for trying you know what I I found that's supposed to work is you inhale as much as you can and then at that point you inhale and last Quick like that and somehow it I don't know I don't know what it does but it actually he actually says at the end don't do that because it'll make you freak out more oh inhale he's saying don't do Opex that's what I would say all right well I don't think like emptying all of my breath like I'm just is there a part two is there a sequel to this you know I'll hold off judging you sir until you tell me how the rest of this technique goes all right how about that you've built a lot of suspense here and I I don't know about you guys I feel I have more questions than I had answers before I  read that thing all right the U.S will never be good at soccer oh my God  not that Jesus Christ guys come on we've got to get it together yeah we we will never be listen I'll tell you this the rest of the world today American black people give a  about soccer that is the end of all of you I have been watching ESPN since the late 80s and I can tell you the second American black people give a  slash are allowed to play it's  over it is  over um all right hey Billy you capitalist  all right you've been going off on a lot of tangents recently I mean recently my whole  life regarding American superiority in sports I never said that when the  did I say that I'll tell you what's  amazing I posted this thing on  professional level badminton it is absolutely  insane it's one of the the sickest Sports I've ever seen ping pong is  amazing I like all of that  okay there's another thing too about like you know what's about really going to be a sad thing is you guys watch volleyball women's volleyball I know you're not allowed to in Hollywood because you're like well you know not in a predatory way I don't watch I do 100 I just sit there those fat asses and those thick thighs and I just go look at these gorgeous these  Amazonian goddesses that didn't lean on their looks and actually get up every day and trans  amazing it's hot chicks doing something like when the  do you ever see that  amazing but you know what's funny ugly chicks who don't look good in  booty shorts are now like here we change the shorts if they can get it get now now I got a  dad gut do I tell people can we get rid of the half shirt no I am too old and ugly to wear that  okay let beautiful people be beautiful right listen we all know the one thing the the everything that a woman has ever accomplished is based on the fact that they're hot you know like guys why haven't you read more Edith Wharton right  not just because it's a book because she's plain you don't want to  her and the second you don't want to  her you don't care what she has to say forget about what she wrote really the hot chick walked up to you with a  pop-up book and said I read this I wrote this you would  read it right in front of her you're literally gonna take away what makes guys give a  about the sport I'm just being honest if you take away those  booty shorts women's volleyball is going to lose all of their funding because we're the only ones watching it women do not watch sports  you watch other  you watch other  and that  makes money all right you leave the lingerie League alone no I'm kidding there's plenty of plain Janes that I don't want to  that have vaginas that have accomplished amazing things but I don't remember their names because they're not hot  and my male ego always says I have a shot and your way in is knowing their name all right another 19 minutes to do I am literally just saying dumb  just to be saying it um all right the U.S will never be good at soccer all right are you going to take away our blue check next who gives a  hey Billy you capitalist  uh you've been going off on a lot of tangents recently regarding American superiority in sports uh you claim that the reason the U.S isn't the best at sports like soccer rugby is because we don't give a  yeah don't you watch the Olympics haven't you seen American citizens that barely have rights in this country dominate that's when we like people of color when the Olympics come along they were like Yay USA you you gotta win a gold medal oh my God the neighborhood s go I need more of a mixed crowd for these jokes to land what you haven't discussed is why walk or aren't part of in the U.S because there's no money in it oh are you going to explain my country to me oh thank you arrogant person could what are you gonna let me guess you're gonna come to the U.S and go to New York City is that what you're going to do go to the top of the Empire State Building go to the  Statue of Liberty could she look less welcoming by the way I always love it give us your poor give us your weather and you see the look on her face we don't want him um could the U.S dominate in sports uh that the rest of the world gives a  about maybe why is there no money in it because you can't broadcast it without generating the same amount of advertising Revenue as sports like baseball I love that he asked the question for me why is there no money in it oh do tell person from another country because you can't broadcast it without generating the same amount of advertising Revenue as sports like baseball or football that allow you to watch two minutes of a game before  you with Wendy's Baconator sorry commercials Where Have You Been for  15 years of this podcast and a dick pill advertising town anyways thanks for all the laughs you pasty bald-headed  um he spelled bald b-a-l-l-e-d is that over is that a sports thing or is he as dumb as me um yeah well then didn't you kind of agree with me listen you know what soccer to me is like Star Wars I don't really hate it I just know that people love it so I make fun of it so I can just watch them flip out I don't give a  about it it's a great sport I like that there's no commercials I love all the drunks singing the songs keeping their throats warm with the scarves you know they got singing to do you know they have to make sure their instrument okay smoke a couple of  and have a point um over here that means you no uh red flags you blew a couple of guys uh red flags hey Bill Burt um a couple weeks ago I kicked my ex out as I learned okay a couple weeks ago you kicked your ex out all right so that sounds like you broke up and you were still living together Jesus Christ um as I learned to take care of the cat she left behind  you're taking care of the cat dude unless you're in a wheelchair there's no reason you haven't punted that thing out your  window it's a cat it's gonna kill birds you can't you can't abandon a dog you know they're too slow they have regular feet you know they don't have those Freddy Krueger gloves on each feet like a cat has a cat can survive there's no reason people there's no reason to bring cats inside just and don't Spade or new to them let them  as much as they want to you know oh by the way Universal Studio a universal  theme park the level of school shooter Vibe when when you go into some of those mystery Worlds the amount of  non-pussy long-coated people in the summer I mean just it's just like can somebody do a background check on this  guy it's just it's unbelievable that was one of 70 things I said in the line to my wife in line to my wife that she just rolled her eyes was like I'm not acknowledging them um anyways as it okay uh as I learned to take care I've really not realized how many times I restart these things I'm sorry for that let me try to get better at this and start it and get to the end all right as I learned to take care of the cat she left behind I have been bringing a number of your pods to hear from people who've dealt with similar situations and throughout that does that mean he listened to other episodes binging he's binging there's no are there oh binging  I said I've

 Nazi boots out from underneath her can't you  I mean at what point do you do a front kick to the puss  to at least create some space so you can stop getting rained down on all right number five this for some reason everybody this still wasn't enough to get out of this relationship this guy's still hanging in there it's crazy is this guy like half golden retriever loyal to a fault  number five back in Savannah where she grew up one of her ex's entire friends and family group hated this woman because they think she killed this guy and got away with uh come on come on I'm saying  all right there's so much more  this is like a Netflix series  which by the way I mean you know if there was any sort of support for gingers that  those that whole family of evil gingers in South Carolina you know we already have Kick a Ginger Day did that story really need to be told it had a happy ending they caught the guy right anyways there's so much more  um  I mean there's a death here there's a murder there's so much more  that I am going to save from my therapist but I figured you'd lose your Ginger infested mind reading this uh imagine and I hear you're lashing out at me dude I'm not the one who  slapped you and  bang somebody else behind your back in your  car right we're wearing a Nazi  what I like Hogan's Heroes okay I just you know I came back from Comic-Con I didn't have a chance Robert Crane's adopted daughter was there oh yeah that's a 60 year old reference all right sorry all right uh I see this email has the bootleg version of me going to China to write confessions I want to read the rest of this but listen dude um wow who would have thought that you adopting a  cat was the worst part of it um was I'm sorry it was not going to be the worst part can I be honest with you that's why like you know when they started doing that thing where they would have like trans people going to school if that's the right word and all of that  like that's why I was against that  it's like wait a minute wait you haven't even figured out how to do the right version heterosexually of this you know what I mean like the sex talk and all of that like all they did was just tell you what happened the sperm goes up the vaginal canal and uh there's billions of them and if one of them penetrates then then the woman is pregnant they should have been a guy like going you're  life will be over  do you know why  feels so good because if it only felt okay we would just jerk off because it wouldn't be worth it meaning a woman can be the greatest thing of your  life or end it that's what they should have been screaming at people forget about all of this  gender  just how it just human being to human being it should be for  everybody right he she's and they's all sit down and the first thing they learned they teach you how to do they teach everybody how to fight right or at least the women right they teach you how to Jujitsu right so then you don't have to be an abusive relationship because you can  the person up too then the next thing they do is they teach you how to break up with somebody this is before they even talk about  or any of that  they should sit down and be like this okay this is this is what like they should  read this they should read this  red flags thing this is the fact that this guy is calling these red flags this was  abuse then I woke up and she took a sword and cut off my pinky toe and was like what you have nine others and she walked out of the  room I don't think schools should be doing anything other than just  what they're good at one place one of those two two plus two is four right and let parents handle the rest of the  no yeah why are you getting involved in that  even the health classes classes I'll  tell them dude I have this sex talk with my kids whatever they turn out to be right so much of it is going to be how to get out of a  relationship all right I help you guys out because there's some of you probably in this boat right now and if you are on this boat right now you can tell because your your face is getting a little hot laughs this is what you have to tell yourself you have to tell yourself I'm breaking up with this person it's going down you just make a list okay I'm doing my laundry I'm  getting a sandwich and then I'm breaking up with this person all right and there's gonna be a  check mark next to all of this  it's going to be ugly No One's Gonna enjoy it but I am  doing it and it's gonna be all you have to say is we need to talk all right why what's wrong and then you just say I'm not happy and then you're in and you're going down the slide and once you start you don't stop you don't  stick a mitt in her face or his face you  you finish the fight you just say I am not happy what do you mean not happy I'm not happy this just isn't working for me I love you but not enough to marry you I want something more than this and this isn't it I'm sorry that's it you don't have to say anything else you just let them flip out and do their little  thing and yada yada yada but you don't break from that this is over once you  say it's over you don't let hold you back in for another  eight months of hell right this is what they should be telling kids in like sixth grade  you got a little boyfriend little girlfriend whatever you're into when he or she walks up to your locker are you thinking like ah  it's over sorry I don't have a punch line at the end of this I think we need to do all of that just teach people how to do that then you can have some  you know whatever the  you want to hear him walking in telling you it right trucker where the  whatever the  you're rich  there was a positive message somewhere in there you guys just got so quiet I got freaked out I was like all right pick up line advice from uh oh then I should say another thing but if you get somebody that you love right that you're into just be  nice to him remind yourself because you will you're  it's like that thing you had to have you know look at that  shirt I gotta hit that  shirt right then you wear it a couple times it goes through the wash and then it's just sort of  laying over there you treat it like  or

cool I went to event last night there's a bunch of pretty women there right and I was sitting across I saw my wife in all of them and she was still the one I wanted to bang yeah yeah someone we just went ah yeah I told her that this morning we had a great breakfast you like that there's some tips for you all right love when the ladies write it pick up advice from a lady hey Billy bumpkins a couple episodes back one of your readers had a question about pickup lines and you asked for advice from a female perspective all right here we go uh I would want to get the hell away from a random guy in a train if he all of a sudden nervously chatting me up well yeah anywhere nervously like hey hey hey there's nothing you don't want any stranger to come up to you start talking to you nervously if a guy came up to me chatting to me nervously I think he was going to stab me um and I was alone uh okay nervously chatting me up and I was alone with nowhere to escape and there was a crazy guy nearby uh let's see but I'm also kind of a nervous person to begin with I'm also 40 and have been in the same relationship since 2005 so I know nothing of dating and pick up lines these days my worst pickup line experience was back in college I was trying to hit on a random cute guy in a bar look at her taking control of this situation ladies get a little European and Canadian every once in a while all right bring your game to the game don't wait for it to come to you right I had been playing on the ultimate frisbee team and recently had a stress fracture in my foot that foot that required crutches for a couple of weeks I was very keen to commiserate with this guy about how miserable it is to be on crutches and I'll awful those swords are in your armpits yeah that is a great opening line that's what you want to do when you're trying to bang somebody bring up sores on your body and how impossible it is to open a door I mean this is the Wrath last one I'm going to read Andrew I'm going to overstay here um and how would it uh it is impossible to open up to open a door or walk and carry something at the same time I can go up to this guy and open up with a pickup line wait I go up to this guy and open this is her pickup line she opens with crutches suck together he says yeah without looking up from his beer this sounds like a Coen brother movie doesn't it I start telling him about my miserable two-week crutch experience and at some point say something along the lines uh uh wait and so I know how you feel to which he angrily yells you do not know how I feel what did I miss is this guy also on crutches anyway she goes He yells you do not know how I feel and she writes I sense his anger and try to change the subject and ask questions about him I'm about six beers deep and just rambling but at some point I check out this guy more thoroughly and realize he only has one leg laughs oh no that's why she left out that detail oh my God that was brilliantly written crutches are not just a two-week inconvenience for him and I absolutely do not know how he feels killing him back at his place and realizing how convenient it is when you have to blow somebody if they only have one leg this extra space you don't have to like lean over come on in you know it's like suicide doors getting into a back seat there you go there it is right there he just moves the stump anyways I'm so embarrassed and disgusted with myself I try to apologize and buy him a beer but he refused got up and left uh on a more positive note the one pickup line that did work for me also was back in college and shortly after the crutches incident I came up to a guy in a staircase of of a jello wrestling party a guy came up to me in a staircase of a jello wrestling party and asked me hey aren't you in my physics class and I say I don't know turns out we were in physics class together but I had not noticed him before so we started sitting together in class and I realized he's a nice friendly guy pretty smart in pretty good shape and likes to party I was waiting for her to go and he has both his legs he invited me out to a party the following weekend which soon became one of my most embarrassing date experiences Jesus  Christ I show up with some of my lady friends and at some point one of my lady friends disappears with one of his guy friends we eventually figured out that they were hooking up in the back seat of a car out the driveway I decided to be a funny girl and smush my face up to the window to give them a little scare oh all right I don't know how I feel about this person I I start to like them then I'm like what the  and then I'm back into this just nuts except I had a few too many beers and I hit the glass a little too hard and my front teeth smash through the window  all right I absolutely love this person now I love this purse I chipped off my front tooth we all had a good laugh today look at like Jim Carrey and Dumb and Dumber uh we had a good laugh as he helped me look for my tooth in the dirt I was pretty mortified turns out he's into Boozies girls who will risk a pencil pencil Tucky yuck mouth what pencil Tucky yuck mouth is that half Pennsylvania's half of Kentucky yeah is that a math reference of a smile just for a laugh I have since gotten my tooth fixed and we've been laying off the booze great and my jello wrestling physics partner is now my husband and we are coming to see you June 24th in Newark New Jersey can't wait all right well you know what I think that's a real positive way to end this podcast I had a  great time

go down to that little gun store right come walking and there's some redneck there i'm like hey man i want to get a gun he's like i hear you what you looking for what you want mossberg over under 357

i'm going to go with honesty i go look dude i don't know anything about guns they terrify me but i'm worried about the zombies all right dude's just like you need a shotgun you need a shotgun man it's got a good sprint it's easy to load doesn't have a lot of working parts got a good spread he kept saying that he's got a good spread i'm like what does that mean he goes well that means you ain't got to be that accurate he's got a good spread further away you are the more  you hit got a good spread in fact you got a problem over here you ain't even got to look you just turn wow that's it you ain't got a problem over here anymore anything that was even remotely a problem ain't there anymore trust me and then these people here they saw what you just did here you ain't got a problem here either 90

washes the whole thing until the other night somebody broke into our car sitting in the driveway starts  with her head right so she starts reading up on guns you know she's reading too much because now she wants to get one but she's just like well i heard you got to keep the bullets in the safe keep this dock in the garage and then what then when i run around the house and assemble it there's some dudes chasing me with an axe you know even thinking this thing through sweetheart he's running around with where's the scope it's in the living room he's in the living room now we're getting this thing i want that  thing loaded right on the bedroom wall right there i'll put that thing in my jam jam sleeves just like that there's no other point that's funny though when you talk about getting a gun you know people like they either totally forward or completely against it you know they either go nuts and start screaming right well they start throwing out those stats you know actually you you increase your chances of getting shot by 80 the second you get a gun in the house really what because i'm gonna load it and shower with it like the  i know it's dangerous you get a pool in your backyard you immediately increase your odds of drowning in your backyard right you couldn't do that before now you step on a rake and you go no i'm telling you i don't buy any of that  stats are so  stupid you know not that they're stupid it's the way people apply them you already have your mind made up and then you go to imright.com you start memorizing a bunch of  and just just throw it up at people this guy tried to get me to go scuba diving i'm not going i don't want to get eaten by a shark he's like well actually 90 of shark attacks actually happen in shallow water it's like no  that's where the people are now it's called the beach 90 of people are frolicking along the coastline it's like there's people swimming to europe let's go to iceland you  right  i don't know but actually i actually like los angeles one of the few east coast people that likes it all my  new york friends and boston friends they come out there try to get a good slice of pizza and four in the morning they can't like just  play socks it's not like exactly where i left what's the point of traveling if it's gonna be different that's so  stupid get a burrito and go on a hike what's wrong with you you're gonna go to hawaii there's no pond hockey this place sucks i got to admit the only thing that freaks me out about los angeles is all the plastic surgery i don't get it why do people get plastic surgery you know why can't you just admit it's over you know you had your time stop trying to look  in your 50s it's weird with their faces yank back looking all shiny right not to mention they haven't even figured it out you know why would you get a facelift can't you look at other facelifts and realize they haven't worked all the bugs out yet right that's what you want to look like like you just lost a fight three days ago don't be a hero let somebody else go in there take the  beach you you lay back wait it out they're just lying to people i know it looks great it looks great put a little ice on it we'll see in a couple weeks all right take it easy jesus christ what the  happened we followed every step did we miss something oh hey hey hold us your keys here's your keys there you

10 years ago when they were stapling ant legs to the top of people's heads remember that your eyes would water looking at their hairline like is that is that sewn in i see pine tar they used to put you in like a headlock hold still use like a nail gun hold stepped guys would tap out after a row and a half  it i don't give a  you wish you got hair plugs 10 years ago do you wish you got polio 60 years ago what else is on your wish list sir no you don't  with your face okay i understand liposuction they screw that up you can put on a shirt right there's no shirt for your face who do they think they're fooling but they're stupid you know and then you lie to yourself i'm just gonna do it i'm just gonna do this just getting just kind of just gonna have this done no you're not you're not you're just gonna wax the fender in your car then that's it the rest of it looks all shitty well maybe i just do the hood and maybe i'll do the back that's how it happens then you look like one of those real housewives face all twisted up  idiots how do i look man i'm idiots do you look like i'm in my 20s no you look weird you look  weird you still look like you're in your 50s i just can't guess what year anymore because i've never seen that year i've never seen that shiny  look it's almost like you discovered a new age between 52 and 53. yeah people there's nothing wrong with being 52 and looking 52. all right you're 52. you didn't get  yeah what would you rather be 52 and look 52 or be 52 and look like a 28 year old lizard all right that's your options at this point you know what's really really like actually embarrassing is that the facelift that's predominantly a white problem do you notice that i've never seen a black person with a facelift ever other than like the jacksons but they're all out of their minds right because their dad made him rehearse all day and sleep in the fireplace i jamming all nine get in there you bastards no hugs no kisses his face permanently twisted up from 50 years of screaming sing  it's understandable with them hey do you know why so many whities need facelifts i love that word i'm trying to bring it back i love it it's funny whitey you know why do you know why so many caucasians need facelifts because we don't know about lotion see that only half of you left that should have been everybody yeah but a lot of you were sitting there like well what about lotion what is this lotion you speak of and what is the magic there in just to put it out there you can use lotion on other parts of your body besides your dick yeah if you ever wondered why your dick still looks brand new but the rest of you was starting to look like an aging pirate because you need to increase the circumference of the lotion distribution all right you got skin everywhere go check yourself out the bottom of your feet look like a prehistoric riverbed that's not part of the natural aging process you dried out i'm not judging you not judging anybody i didn't know anything about lotion never used it the first 33 years of my life never used it to one night i was going out with this black girl right she was getting ready and she was just putting that  on everywhere just slathering it on i thought she had like a rash or something like poison ivy what's going on with you she goes no i'm just making sure i'm not ashy i said ashy she goes dry skin i went mom i guess i freaked her out a little bit because i was like she was like well white people get ashy too i was like yeah you know and i don't think we do yeah i've been alive for 33 years no one has ever said hey bill hey you're looking a little ashy i never even heard that word until you said it she's like you're an idiot stick out your arm so i stick out my arm and ever so gently she just drags her nails down this smoke starts coming up it's like pastry flakes flying off track mark she's signing her name she's like you see that she goes that's ashy your ash freak me out i'm like oh  i'm ashy i didn't know anything about it all i knew was that i always got itchy in the winter couldn't figure it out always got itchy in the window what the  do i get itchy i thought it went the bath towel was dirty that's what i thought and i would change it out and put a fresh one now i'm gonna be okay take a shower dry off  itching again god damn it i hate the winner see that that's why you got to hang out with everybody yeah there's too much information in the world and every group of people misses a little bit white people totally missed the lotion seminar at some point in history i don't know if because we can't see it you know black people get ashy it looks like they like leaned up against a chalkboard or something you know they can see it they miss it their friends help them out like look at your ashy  elbow what is wrong with you right we missed that  the way black people missed the whole register your weapons summit right just never got the information the amount of rappers who've been busted for the unregistered glock in the car just blows my mind it's like why would you do that to yourself do you just want to make an album over the phone is that what it is is that like the new auto tune or some  i don't know no it breaks my heart every time i see it i just think god if he just had one white friend he just had one white friend in his entourage dude would have been sitting there going like is that thing registered you out of your mind get it out of there get it out of there that's illegal that's like  three to five mandatory dude how do you how do you not know that that's the question how do you not  know that this guy's got an unregistered weapon in the car like we're just gonna go driving around with this it's just ridiculous  so see there you go all right you don't need a facelift okay lay off the booze do some cardio moisturize you're gonna be fine okay don't believe in these myths black don't crack it's  they all put lotion on like every 20 minutes during the day it's ridiculous they'll get a giant oil drum with the  at home every morning they wake up they dump themselves in it shake themselves off and walk out the door absolutely glistening listening white guys like me are walking around no hat on ah let's go sailing passing out face down in the sand  speaking of no boozer man i've been i've been really trying to clean up my act as far as that booze and thing goes just really been laying off it you know i don't know what it is your  head gets big as you get older you know you keep boozing you start getting that big alec baldwin john travolta head and you don't notice though cause every day you're brushing your teeth and you're seeing your head and it's just getting a little bit bigger keep drinking i'll have another one right then one day you go to take that cell phone picture and you're just like six inches in front of everybody else you don't think it's a big deal maybe you leaned in because you're feeling good right then also you look at the picture it's like  yeah  it's like i gotta lay off this  so i've been trying to learn uh learn how to fix  around the house that's what's filling up all this time of just being sober that's brutal dude you have no idea how long a year is until you're stoned sober that's  brutal so i'm learning how to fix  right my girlfriend doesn't like it because she says i have a temper you know she's like you know it's just not that you're trying to fix things i said you get frustrated you punch the wall the dog starts shaking i just don't think it's a good idea you know

talk about life you distract them by throwing the ball they don't even notice you're filling their heads up with your theories right you don't do it the old school way the way your parents used to sit down across from you you want to tell me about your day anybody offer you any drugs you're learning about sex you're like dude you're  freaking me out trying to eat a pop-tart here right hey just taking the bag you play catch with them that's it you talk about life right what's that son ah we're not going to church today  that that's all a bunch of  god's everywhere but i gotta go down there to see him really and he's mad at me down there and i owe you money go  yourself  just try not stupid it's ridiculous okay it's in here all right it's not down it's in here they try to take it it's that it's in here you do something good you feel good you do something bad you feel bad you know unless you're like a sociopath and you'll feel  you know unless you've got somebody duct taped upside down in your apartment you know and if you do something like that i want you to feel like you can come to me you know yeah come to me confess all of that we'll go down to the precinct we'll tell them

arguing a lot lately all right but you know you know i love her i love her to death okay it's weird i love it at death but when i watch her eat toast i just want to i just want to choke her i don't know what it is it's like it's the routine right left then the middle just why don't you just fold it in half and  eat it you know what i mean it's unreal you know that's that's when you know you you know you met the right one when you want to slap the  out of him but you don't you know you want to leave but you don't there's something about him you just can't  leave right so don't settle down till you meet one like that that's that's when you know till then you know put a condom on you know just bang as many as you can so you don't have a mid-life crisis that's what you do don't tell your mother i'm telling you any of this  either  yeah that's my uh that's that's my game plan you know i do have a dog that doesn't count for anything i've never understood that you know i love my dog but uh i've learned a lot on being a dog owner man you know any dog is a good dog unless you're a psycho you know i got a pit bull it's still a great dog unless you're a  psycho and evidently i'm a psycho because my dog has been i've just been a complete maniac over the last like six months you know i didn't realize that dogs feed off your vibes you know like if you're chilling they're chilling you know if you're sleeping they're sleeping but if you're a psycho like me and you're screaming at the ref on tv being like dude you gotta be  kidding me i didn't realize that dog was over in the corner being like yeah you gotta be  kidding me  this is  i don't know what this guy's mad at but i love this guy this guy feeds me is it the door are you mad at the door  yeah i had no idea i was amping this dog up i was so selfishly in my own world i'd be like on the computer and would crash and go ah really really dog's over in the corner with like a chew toy i never noticed like that game seven look she was getting on her face and one day i amped her up too much had no clue and i went outside we were just walking down the street and some poor bastard comes the other way the dog's like that's that  at this guy i had a puller bag all right dude i'm sorry man i'm sorry she's never done anything like that right looking down at the dog what's wrong with you dogs looking at me like huh i got that son of a  didn't i i love you you feed me i got you how the hell did you see him that far away man your ears must be better than mine it's unbelievable right then i got nervous i got nervous around my own dog i started thinking  are pitbulls really like this do they just go psycho man this is nuts right that's another bad vibe to have around your dog because they pick up on that vibe right this dude comes walking down the street and miley's just start thinking like oh  she gonna do it again oh  oh  dog just looks at me like oh  what oh  what him hit him runs in another guy hit a polar bag jesus christ i'm sorry looking down at the dog dogs trying to chest bump me and  right dude it got so bad one day she almost she almost ate a landscaper right yeah so i'm like i gotta i gotta take this thing to a trainer man so i load it up in the prius and i drive over there right yeah i have a prius go ahead judge me  i love that  if you have a prius people you know you can't win you got a truck with a big lift kit people oh it's fine because he has a little dick all right how come it's not because he has a dick down to the floor maybe that's why he needs all that clearance right you know if that means you have a little dick then if i have a prius doesn't that mean i have a huge dick right because according to my friends it means i'm a  right  anyways let me towel off here for a moment so i  take this dog down to this train all right i show up got the dog in the back train comes out he's got his hat on backwards he got stubble you know big large cargo pants you know all shorts on and stuff i'm thinking this guy's a psycho right and i look at my dog my dog's like sizing him up i'm like just perfect he can handle him so the guy goes all right when you hand this dog to me make sure you got the lease totally taught like that all right don't have any slack in it i said no problem right and somehow i  up i left a little slack in it and this dog just lunged right at the dude's balls all right and just barely missed him and just got a big mouth full of his big cargo shorts right and immediately just grabbed and goes all right get out of here get out of here right but instinctively i tried to help out he just goes get the  outta here yeah i didn't realize that the only reason why the dog was acting like that was because i was there and it felt like it needed to protect me so the second i left the situation immediately just became awkward right dog was just sitting there like okay like i thought we were like together and we were like friends and you were some bad guy and all of a sudden he just drove away and i don't know how to feed myself you want to be friends  yeah come back four days later the dog's laying at the guy's feet all right he's rubbing her belly she's reaching out playing with his goatee and  and he goes back have a seat why don't you uh why don't you uh take me through your day with this dog immediately i started getting like this first 48 vibe right like they're coming at me so i got like defensive i'm like what do you want me i take it for a hike every morning he goes that's good that's good anything you know special happen on the hike i'm like well you know i don't know she takes a  i pick it up it's like all right easy you play any games with her i go yeah at the end of the hike i let her i let her you know for reward for going on the hike i let her run up the stairs by herself i go go on cleo and let her run up the stairs and i count five one thousand and then i run up there and then we start wrestling put her in a headlock sweep her front legs right but a tail's wagging you know she's not growling i go that's a good thing right he's like no it's  horrible i'm like why he goes you just taught your dog to claim the house and then fight for it every  day after the hike no wonder this thing's trying to attack the mailman you know so then i got upset i'm like wait a minute dude you're telling me like i can't even play with my dog he's like no you can play with it but you got to bring that energy back down the problem is you keep amping this thing up getting that mike singletary look on his face then by the time you walk out doesn't matter if you're relaxed mentally the dog is like walking through the tunnel at the rose bowl like this is what we play for  somebody hit somebody  beth so i'm actually learning to control my temper because of a  pitbull so i don't know my girl's been bugging me lately she's ready to settle down i think i'm ready to settle down too you know i got the one i know i've been saying this  for years i haven't you know she's great only thing i don't like is she uh she's really into reality tv she watches all those dumb shows put ten  in the house somebody tries to find a wife right she watches fat people cry about fudgicals blubbering their eyes oh no sometimes i don't even open the wrapper i just started and then i get down to the stick and i know i should stop because it's made out of wood she's just saying crying right along with him dad throw yourself in the river you fat  ah she gets so mad at me look i don't put on tv to cry i like to be entertained i love when they fall in the treadmill and go flying into the drywall it's like some modern-day medieval weapon i love it all those horrific shows biggest fights we have she watches uh intervention there's another that yeah that's the energy like that oh my god it's so awesome watching a family completely fall apart what is entertaining about that when they had that classic before picture the pre-meth picture she was so beautiful she was the prom queen everybody loved her then they cut to her like laying in like a gutter i'll suck your dick i'll touch your dick i'll suck your dick no we have these huge battles you know what the matter she ever got at me was one time she was watching this show was like a poor excuse for the view and they started talking about domestic violence right for the 9 millionth time this year they're talking about domestic violence just in case you know you didn't get the memo you know evidently you know just some people didn't get it it's not okay to slam your wife's head into the cupboard drawers because she didn't dry the can opener off properly you know it's gonna  rust right how do you not know not to do that  do they really have to keep talking about it it's like wife beaters watching for oh  ah now i get it up to daisy sweetheart here we go there you go  so at the end of the hour they come to the logical conclusion they're like there is no reason to hit a woman there is no reason to hit a woman and i was just like really i could give you like 17 right off the top of my head you could wake me from a drunken stupor i could still give you like nine dude there's plenty of reasons to hit a woman you just don't do it but to sit there and suggest that there's no reason dude the level of ego behind that statement what are you levitating above the rest of us you're never annoying women how many times have you thought about slapping you you  guy in the head this week there you go every day you didn't do it right oh dude it drives me nuts there's no reason there's no reason really no reason how about this you marry a girl you fall in love you buy her a house you go to work every day paying off the house you come home one day she's banging the next door neighbor hands you divorce papers you got to move out sleep on a futon and still pay for that house that she's going to stay in no reason i'm not saying you should do it but there's plenty of  reasons in that arc of a story all right that was a hypothetical you want an actual story i'll give you one i'll give you one all right i  up my foot playing drums trying to get my bass drum foot as fast as john bonham's because i figured that's a good thing to focus on 43 years of age never married no kids i figured this this is going to lead me to the light right this this is what i need to do so i don't know what i did i i felt like after i played for like an hour and afterwards i felt like it literally like there was some  stabbing me in the bottom of my foot right like i had lightning coming out of the bottom of my foot so i did the typical guy thing like i'm not going to the hospital sleep it off be fine right next morning i wake up my foots even worse and i gotta walk my crazy dog so i'm like i can't do it my foot's killing me so i wake up my girl go sweetheart sweetheart can you do me a favor can you do me a favor can you walk the dog for me can you uh just take the shift you know i'll do your afternoon shift can you just do me this all he can do this for me and she's just like oh you know i had a late late night last night i'm tired i have a big day and i just go  it she goes what do you mean  it it's like why can't you just say no why do you always gotta like waterboard me with like a 20-minute explanation that eventually winds its way around to go  yourself just say no so i'm just limping out of the room whatever go back to bed you got a big dave right so now i'm like limping down the street i got like tourette's  goddamn  dogs walking next to me i gotta admit i got a little childish i did i got a little childish you know i was just thinking about my relationship i'm like this is the relationship i'm in you're just gonna do whatever the hell you wanna do right and  me fine i'm gonna do whatever hell i wanna do i feel like listening to my ipod on full blast walking around the house that's what i'm gonna do so that's what i did turned it all the way up and i just my whole plan was just to walk by her like i didn't even know her that was it she came down the hall i just ghosted her just walked right past her just trying to piss her off and i got to tell you something work like a charm worked like a charm yeah hung my coat up turned around by the time i turned around she was already yelling at me but the music was so loud not only could i not hear her it actually looked like she was singing the song that i was listening to oh it's one of the highlights of the relationship so i knew what she was saying i was like whatever i don't want to talk about it leave me alone i'm going onto the computer right so i limp over and i sit down and unbeknownst to me she's like now we're going to talk about this right now comes up and slaps the headphones off my head i got a big i got big ears it  hurt so i'm like honey leave me alone i don't want to talk about it put the headphones back on she comes right back up again slaps him off a little harder this time they spin halfway around my head caveman dna starts coming up talking through my teeth honey leave me alone don't want to talk about it right put him on third time she comes up slaps him right across the room and i snap i'm like fine you want to have the fight let's  have the fight she's like we will discuss this later when you calm down oh right there i just wanted to roll her up on her yoga mat and stuff her behind the couch just leave her there until she got thirsty come on let me out of here i have a spin class you've made your point this is this is ridiculous no that's the thing really is that's the thing i hate that saying there's no reason obviously i'm not saying to hit a woman you know but saying there's no reason i think that's crazy when you say there's no reason that kills any sort of examination as to how two people ended up at that at that place you say there's no reason you cut out the buildup you just left with the act how are you going to solve it if you don't figure it out look how awkward it is in here right now i said you shouldn't hit a woman i'm just saying how come you can't ask questions you can only ask questions about what the guy did you can never ask about the woman why is that why is that what is that what is what does answer him write me what does that mean are you the idiot who got up halfway through the special during the bit and you're like walking around like i'm not  taping a special here what's wrong with you what's wrong with you  had to ignore all of that and now you're gonna like yell out and not only that yell something that makes no  sense whatsoever answer him answer him  every  special i do there's always one always right down the  middle  talking about hitting women sweetheart and i think you just added another reason jesus  christ i love this i'm not even in a relationship with her and she's  nagging me   unbelievable look i understand hitting a woman's a bad thing okay how come you can't  ask questions i just don't understand like if i get bit by a rattlesnake wouldn't you guys have some questions right how did it happen did you not see it were you  with it how did this snake get so mad it almost killed you firemen put out a fire they don't just drive away afterwards they sift through the debris how did it start here's an oily rag right look i realize i'm coming off pretty ignorant right about now i realize that let me extend an olive branch then okay i realize that there's some animal guys out there okay horrible guys you know have a rough day at the factory come home tune a casserole and just start swinging all right  i'm not trying to say that those people don't exist i realize they exist they should be buried underneath the prison okay so if i can admit that ladies can you at least admit that every ass kicking doesn't just fall out of the  sky really even hockey has two minutes for instigating right they understand that some back and forth happened before that  you know you know what it is is every case is handled like that rihanna one well they just say the guy's a piece of   this guy blah blah send him a jail then they never ask anything about that you know i'm not saying he should have done it but i'm just saying just say it dude in your heart of hearts what do you think was going down before that happened you think she was just sitting there going oh my god baskin robbins you want to get some ice cream  you know what do you think maybe they were having some epic end of the relationship fight and some crazy  was being said maybe she was screaming in his ears some crazy female  like oh  all your friends i don't give a  maybe that's why i sell more albums than you  right to be fair she could have just been sitting there going i need a tissue do you keep those in the glove box oh my god i'll bring my out i'll bring my out now  that because you know what it is they never address how women argue which i think is the core of a lot of that  you know i got to tell you something man like i never knew how women argued but after 20 years of losing every significant battle in a relationship i finally figured out how they argued i'm going to tell you something i'm starting to turn this franchise around i have begun a winning tradition this is how they argue as far as i can tell all right if they're right they argue the point and they stay on point and make sure you stay on point until you're down on your knees apologizing begging for forgiveness all right no problem with that totally respect it but here's the thing if they're wrong they go rogue they go off-road they start thinking of  you're sensitive about maybe you don't get along with your dad and in their head they just start concocting this evil statement totally designed this desperate hail mary attempt to make you so  mad you just call him a  that's what it is and  trumps all the  they did to start the argument now it's not about that well there's no reason to call me a  and then that's it you're in this room now right my girl knows my big thing is my big fear in life is to be that dude who grows old you know grows old alone has like that basement apartment just screaming up at the younger couple turn it down that isn't music so i noticed that anytime she was losing a fight i don't know what she just feels but that's why you're just going to grow old and be alone then i'd lose my  the next thing you know i'm in the kitchen washing dishes for the ninth  time in a row this is what the argument was about i was so right what happened so if you learn anything from my ignorance tonight just know this next time you're in a battle with your beautiful woman your wife girlfriend whatever and they start out of nowhere okay you're winning and they just start saying that crazy  out of nowhere just know in that moment you've won the fight okay all right don't get mad bob and weave slip all of that  maybe because you got a little dick just let that slide stay in the pocket of the argument okay it's over the argument is over you've won just take a knee and run out the clock all right yes lean on the ropes let them punch themselves out and then in the end you throw this psychology right back at him well maybe we should discuss it later when you calm down and they won't hook up with you for a couple of days who cares who cares you rub one out rub one out like a man it's a champagne of victory oh that's what i've learned i finally learned to like keep my cool in my relationship happened a couple years ago right me and my girl had this big argument one day right actually you guys want to hear a story you want to hear about the time my girl punched me in the face on her birthday you want to hear that one this is what happened to me i'm really honest the fight started like three months earlier it's like the middle of march we're just driving around nelson she sees this closing store she's like oh my god i didn't know they had one of those out here we need to stop and go in there so i i  it let's go in there i walk in immediately i see it's one of these stores that doesn't have any chairs and i know what they're trying to do i'm gonna be standing right next to her and when she likes something i gotta buy it i don't give a  i'm not playing that i go over and i sit down underneath a mannequin got like the dress hanging in my head sir you can't sit there i don't give a  looks like i'm doing it looks like i'm doing it all right so unbeknownst to me she finds some sweater that she likes right some ridiculously priced like 400 bucks or some  like that right so she knows it's not her birthday none of that crap she can't ask me for it so now she's got to go into manipulation mode what do i use what do i use do i be sad do i pout do i use sex can't do that you know what she went with she went with the little girl all right she just came out she's just like i'm like what's up she was like saw something that i liked i just want to be like well then why don't you  pay for it  cause she goes over and she shows it to me right and i'm like it's 400 bucks she goes can you get it i go no i'm not doing that  that it's not your birthday it's not valentine's day it's march am i getting you there for st patrick's day get the  out of here i'm not doing it so i don't want to happen we're driving home and somehow she manipulated the the argument not that she asked for the sweater and not that i said no it was the way i said no right got in this huge argument got so mad by the time i we got to back to the house i just told her to get out i'm driving away so i just drove away in the prius right so i was so  up about it i had to call my sister up right call her up to get a female perspective she's laughing her ass off going you took all the bait you're an idiot i go what do i do she goes why don't you go back down to the store and just buy this sweater hold on to it and give it to her a few months later for her birthday i'm like  genius genius i hate the pressure of the birthday all her friends oh what are you getting yeah what are you gonna get a  sweater  bam that's it got it all right fast forward three months it's her birthday right she's you know i'm laying in bed she wakes up she want to go to some restaurant that night she's like did you make the reservations i'm like i haven't made them yet but you know we'll be good right she starts freaking out what do you mean it's my birthday what do you need to make he didn't make the reservations i'm like sweetheart it's a tuesday in the middle of a recession i'm sure that there's going to be a table right so she starts freaking out in the back of my head i'm like i got this sweater i'm good right so the more she yells at me the funnier it becomes to me but like an  rather than laughing to myself i sort of snickered out loud right sort of giggled a couple times and she just snapped like are you laughing at me are you laughing at me on my birthday and then the more she yelled the more i laughed the more i laughed the more she yelled and it was just this vicious  thing all the way up right to go she got all the way to the point she was standing at the back door going you're gonna laugh at me on my birthday  you boom slams the door runs down the stairs at that point i'm literally in the fetal position like dying laughing walking towards the bathroom then i'll start here she came back up the stairs and i'm not gonna lie to you i got a little scared for a half second no i did i was in my underwear i was feeling vulnerable she comes flying into the bathroom and the second i saw her face i knew she was going to hit me right and i'm such an  i actually have a game plan for when a woman's going to hit you like that's how many women i've pissed off in my lifetime i actually know what's going down this is how it is most women they're flailers all right unless they had some sort of mma training then you're on your own you're probably gonna catch a few right but most of them are flailers most are right-handed so you got to guess overhand right that's the first thing you got to guess so you get down the pocket right that overhand right comes in bam you catch that wrist second the right's coming you know the left's coming bam you catch that one this is the crucial moment second you got the right the next then you got the left immediately you got to step back and you got to go like this because she's going to try to kick you right in the balls as she kicks you then you spin them around tuck your head down low because they will try to headbutt you and then you just use the weight of your torso to slowly bring them down to the floor as you whisper sweet things oh look at the tiles remember you picked those out they go so well with the wallpaper right but she tricked me she came into the bathrooms and she invented this new punch she didn't throw a right she didn't throw a left she came i think there's two fisted i called it like the defibrillator right just caught me in the shoulder and like in my appendix it's a  bam like that almost went flying back into the bathtub and i caught myself and she's all ready for me to take the bait and flip out and i didn't i just remained calm that's just like sweetheart i think you need to go to work now she didn't know what to do she was like and she just just walked out all right went down to the car drove to work i walked out in the kitchen i got some cheerios sat down and started watching sportscenter  three minutes later all sudden the phone rings all right pick up the phone and just hear her going hi okay things got a little crazy like a little crazy you almost split my head open in the goddamn tub i'm sorry i'm just i'm i'm passionate i'm pat that's what they say when they start swinging i'm passionate i just have so much love for you i try to cause you to have a seizure  i don't know i'm good at this i  up my personal life all the time man i really do you know i'm afraid to get married man why why wouldn't as man wouldn't be afraid to get married at this point you know look at kobe look at the  he's going through right now all right guys getting a divorce his wife's going to get 70 million bucks never hit a layup in her life you know can anybody

an epidemic of gold digging  in this country and every night i put on the news and i'm waiting for someone to address it  every night never see it you know and every night i bring up gold digging  and the whole crowd pulls back like i'm up here talking about bigfoot all right like i'm saying the moon's made out of cheese or something talking about  people they're everywhere how many how many more

 are the wife beaters for men yeah they are except we don't have that rihanna lumped-up photo in the end so it's not obvious it's in the eyes it's in the lines in your face it's in mel gibson's high-pitched voice on the answering machine i had to give up my laker tickets right that is the sound of a man being taken for everything he's got i got to tell you it says i'm envious of women okay i'm not saying your problems get solved but at least they're taken seriously you know people you got 1 800 numbers you get you got ribbons there's groups people give a  anything happens to a guy who's just considered funny some woman cut her husband's dick off threw in the garbage disposal and turned it on people thought it was hilarious everything hey stumpy nobody cares do you think of a guy removed a woman's titty and threw it in the dryer anybody would be joking about it the next day the entire country would grind to a halt there'd be a moment of silence the nfl would have some special colored headband everybody had to wear for an entire month the most effeminate color they could possibly come up with  all my heroes they're going down arnold schwarzenegger another great man another great man taken down by that gold-digging  of a man he's got and i'm not i'm not saying he's not a piece of  for doing what he did was a piece of  move but how come only he got chastised what about the maid why was she called the maid the that entire story she was never called a  ever just boggled my mind she knew his wife first name basis played with their kids  her husband in their own goddamn bed that's right down the checklist first ballot hall of fame  right there never why do you think she hooked up with them because of that 1987 flat top he's still rocking the giant space between his teeth i could put this mic cord through or i think maybe it's all that kindergarten cop money laying around the goddamn bedroom no it's awful it's a horrific thing to see as a guy watching guys go through that  you know and then there's no there's no sort of examination of it they just go he's an idiot hey stupid that guy's stupid if that guy's stupid what the  am i right does it even make sense why would you do that why would you accomplish all that and then  it up hooking up with one of the ugliest human beings i've ever seen in my life not saying i'm a prize i'm just saying you know it's got to be something beyond that right you know i think it is i think it comes down to the way he talks you know  that dude should be unloading trucks in transylvania that should be that should

zone for over four decades four decades nothing but net bang a maid in my own bed dude that's a layup are you serious i had a hit movie with the  i don't even need a condom  right and then what

you know just balance it out a little bit it's like does every dude walking in that house got to look like me like yeah you're the  eight-year-old  no but it's unbelievable everybody is talking about pedophiles and all that type of stuff i i don't know maybe there's more of them nowadays is it like easier now because the internet you know you know because back in the day you had to work for it right you know you got to get an ice cream truck you had to buy the budget you got to figure out when the kids got out of school you pick a straggler you know now you just go on the internet you just google www.eight-year-old whose parents are falling asleep you know you're in there oh it's unreal when's the last time you saw a kid riding a bicycle down the street you're never going to see that  again you never see them playing outside parents just have them inside now man they're just feeding them and feeding them you know just making them fatter and fatter i'm trying to make them unfuckable that's what it is that's why you see all these 450-pound eight-year-olds just come waddling out of the house you can't get that kid in the car i'm serious pedophiles in general are very skinny people they got to start chalking up their forearms they're  blowing out their backs  just a theory people seriously honestly don't take this  too seriously does he really think that is he think that that's why there's i don't know rented that movie uh pride recently have you guys seen that movie anybody see that it's about the first all-black swim team and the difficulties they had to go through being the first all-black swim team let me ask you a question how many of those white people are evil movies are they gonna make it's like it's all the way down to swimming you know i'm starting to run out of white guilt you know no it's like those movies they started off unbelievable start off with roots right white guilt was at an all-time high i could barely even watch it i'm like dude i got it my ancestors are evil okay please please turn the channel dude please turn the channel they still hitting them  during the channel this is gonna be on all week jesus christ during the channel then in the 80s there was like a football movie then like cuba gooding want to be like a scuba diver remember that  and now it's all the way down to swimming and i gotta admit i don't think i give a  you know i'm not trying to be a dick but it's a recreational activity plus i've been in pools there's been black people in the pool you know i never saw any white guy like trying to like  like prevent people from getting into the pool it's like they just like making this  up i'm not i'm not being a dick here either okay just to clarify you know i just want anybody coming up to me after the show line you know i was thinking it and then you  said it ned i'm not saying that i don't think black  people should be allowed to put on some speedos and go for a dip i'm not saying that  i'm just saying these movies like the characters aren't even believable like they always have to have like that the over-the-top uninhibited white racist character you know you know that guy he's a guy like uh he's supposed to represent all the white evil you know he's like the dude they always have like screaming during the movie trailer they'll be like they were the first all black swim team get out of the pool he's got like a big vein in his forehead he's just screaming  look not even looking around you know dude it's ridiculous real racism is quiet it's subtle people look around first make sure that you know they make sure the coast is clear there's disclaimers like dude you know i'm not racist but uh these insert group name followed by  up conversation right that's how it goes down it's not just some guy just standing up there there's neighbors in the pool do you approve of this i work at the bank could i be fired immediately please i'm just saying could you just make the  like believable you know the honest thing is those movies are starting to give me a complex you know because any time they do a movie about a group of people that thinks dumb  about another group of people it's always like white dudes so it's like white dudes the only ones who think ignorant  about other people you know no mexican guy ever walked up to somebody from india like dude what the  is that is that like itchy  you what is it  white dude's the only one's walking around why you guys don't eat cows give you a bunch of  well then why are you wearing sandals guys wearing sandals this guy's a fan no i'm just saying you know just balance the movies out a little bit like just have some of the evil  that black people say about white people you know when we're not around you know like like what are some good examples you know you know like what i mean you're hanging out you had a rough day you know what are some of the classics you know what smell like wet dogs right you got headlights or something like that right just just slip some of that  in there get out of the pool wash your hand  friend just make it seem a little more dude i'm just saying it's all the way down to swimming i mean where the  do you go from there we do like ping pong they were the first all black ping-pong team they're gonna steal the paddles denzel my daughter's not playing ping pong you got to go out there and show the white man your van ping pong no i'm not i'm not saying um i know it's always just weird bringing this  up but no i'm not saying white people aren't evil either because i know where you i got that evil in me i do i can i can feel it that's why i try to suppress it i try to dress casual you know what i mean i'm serious man i tried a suit on the other day i felt it coming up like  man i want to take over some  right i'm gonna start telling people what to do i'm gonna go pollute the lake blaming on my secretary you know dude i don't like those movies when they make black and white people get along man even those ones seem ridiculous you know cause it always has to be like some sort of lesson in those movies just like you know i never looked at it that way it's like that never happens you know any time i've ever hung out with a black dude at no point during the evening is he like trying to like teach me how to dance you know you know that interracial footloose moment they always have to have in those movies and i never go to his neighborhood and like try to like save a school you know how many times are they gonna make that movie you know that movie the white person goes into the projects they just have to make a difference you know they just made that movie again what uh was it hillary swank it's like did you even need to go see it it's like let me guess she shows up and they don't accept her right then she goes home she cries to her effeminate boyfriend is wearing sweatpants and he's cooking something for some reason right and he convinces her he convinces her to give it one more chance right since she goes back down there she starts drawing out their inner beauty next thing you know they put a do-rag on it she starts  dancing and it's just embarrassing for all races involved for the love of god stop making that  movie dude the amount of times they made that movie i would think i would know somebody white who actually did that  you know yeah that's my gay saves ghettos that's what he does you know i sit around i watch sportscenter you know he's in the projects every weekend he's writing his name on the blackboard my name's mr michael all right who threw that who's through that it's just annoying after a while you know and it always  works out too any time the white person goes down there i want to make that i don't want to see a movie where it doesn't work out like the white dude goes down there the first day just gets the  kicked out of him you know just leaving all negative you can't  help these people you know you go down there you try to do something nice i couldn't get a goddamn word it's a 300 prescription so here's something i saw the other day i've not seen a long time you know what i saw i saw balls on a dog  hey remember that  dude i have not seen that since like the late 90s i was literally sitting there looking like i remember that  dogs used to have balls i remember that how about you pit your friend ah look at his balls you know and everybody would laugh no but somewhere along the line it became socially acceptable to cut your dog's balls off whether there's anything wrong with them or not under the whole fear of like well we don't do it he's going to  another dog they're going to make more dogs and what are we going to do with all these dogs they're not going to have homes what are we going to do i love that  what are we going to do it's like dude they're animals just let them go they'll be fine they got fangs they got claws they'll form packs you know they'll help with the obesity problem in this country you know you come stumbling out of a cheesecake factory just like i heard a  rottweiler running at you you gotta run to your suv diving dukes of hazard style right no i'm pro dog balls i am i don't think there's anything wrong with it dog should be able you know  who he wants to and it's ridiculous no i want to get a dog i want to get a dog i've been dying to get a dog and immediately my girls immediately well we have to get it from getting a diet we have to get them fixed i'm like why do we have to get them fixed well yeah that's what you're supposed to do don't know like well you're not a veterinarian she's like well neither are you great then it's a stalemate neither one of us knows what the  we're talking about so let's not start cutting anything off the animal right so of course she's a female she's got to go out and prove me wrong goes out and gets the book okay see it says right here um you get your dog fists he's less like you'd be aggressive okay okay no no listen god you're such an  just listen and then it says he's less likely to rip up the furniture yeah there's nothing you know just like sweetheart when we were a kid we had a family dog all right he had his balls okay yeah sure occasionally he humped your leg you know but generally speaking he just laid around he begged for food he came home he was excited but he wasn't wearing a raincoat like jerking off or something you know he lived he lived for 15 years without incident with his balls you know no sexual harassment nothing no i i think i think it's i think it's weird how like human beings are trying to control the population animals you know like any time the deer population gets out of control some dude will literally get on tv and be like all right the deer population is up to about 17 1800 realistically we need to get that number down about five six of them all right so starting them off you got a gun  shoe one in the face just sitting at home like what are the deer doing that's so bad for the environment you know they're gonna eat all the  grass coming up the trees just nibbling just nibbling dude the deer didn't put a hole in the ozone layer all right that's not a bunch of dogs clogging up the freeways it's us right we can  all we want no one's gonna stop you could have you could have 15 kids have a 16th on the way no one's going to get on tv and be like all right paul is still  starting to mop you got a gun  shoot him in the face do what you got to do this guy he's out of control no it's great it's great man you can just keep banging away you can just keep banging away making one useless mediocre not gonna invent  kid after another  i don't understand people like that so don't you realize after your third loser kid you don't have the dna to make somebody special it's like what are you doing all you're doing you're just making more in the way people just walking around looking up at  as you're trying to get down the sidewalk you know well you know that dude whenever you're going to the deli there's always that guy in front of you doesn't know what he wants what kind of what kind of bread is that it's like dude stop making that  guy jesus christ that dude that dude is everywhere that's why i love all people i love old people they always with their family photos cracks me up they always well they're all proud like well we had five kids and then they all had five and it's like yeah none of you did  i don't recognize anybody in that photo you just made 30 people who are all taking a  every day that ends up in a river that's not a family photo that's an environmental disaster and you framed it  no that's my solution for global warming everybody's talking about cars and oil that doesn't matter it's just too many people you know there's too many people doing it she said you know you want to help the environment just stop  right i'm not saying stop  but you know pull out you can still have your fun right you gotta stop looking at babies like they're these cute things all right they're not they're all right they are cute but most of them are just gonna grow up there's gonna end up being another  and like an suv that doesn't pull out far enough into the intersection right now you gotta wait a whole nother light to make a left and you're just sitting there losing your  screaming at your windshield with this dude who didn't need to exist it's like there's no reason for that guy we got that guy i don't know  that's my plan they should just make babies illegal for like the next like 25 30 years right that'd be great think about somebody's born three people born every second to one person dying right so if you're not making anybody it's like bam somebody just died right somebody just fell down some stairs somebody just tripped over a skateboard right and you know what  lanes just opening up on the highway right you know you get to work a little sooner you're in a better mood dude you get it down to like 30 000 people 30 000 people be the  all right super bowl comes around everybody can go right everybody can go 22 you get to play the odds of you making it in the nfl it's ridiculous dude even if you suck you could still you could block on punts you'd be like a wedge breaker or maybe that guy holding the first down marker like yeah i'm gonna be doing something you wouldn't have to recycle there was 30 000 people man everybody here you could literally drive your own tank you drive a tank you could throw toxic waste off the top you could shoot a bald eagle right in the head that is plenty of them plenty of them dude they're  all over my tank what the  am i supposed to do  look people i don't read okay seriously none of my  is researched you know but i know all the  i'm talking up here i i think i'm onto something with this you know it's like i'm eliminating people but like no one has to die that's it just stop making dude we're gonna end up like china they got like over a billion people just just jam-packed every day it's like the subway if you're just standing there you can't even fall asleep oh  sorry about that just jam-packed you never think about that  just standing i'm gonna be sitting there first of all how easy is it to get away with the crime over in china you know first of all you pick somebody's pocket you know you don't have to run away you just  weave your way back in the crowd stand over here guys standing like dude somebody just took my wallet dude he's right over there he's right over he's right there so he's got black hair he's five foot five he's dressed like it's in reservoir dog she's right over there no that's where we're gonna be headed how many more strip malls can you make places to get donuts and people to get their nails done everybody's all excited this area is really actually exploding exploding it's like no dude people are  and then they're just building more  i don't know i get my act together man i'm really uh really at a critical point in my life you know i am i'm serious i'm a  psycho man i realized this about myself like you know i'm not married you know and i'm really getting to that critical age where you know pretty soon i'm just you know i got to pick a street either i'm going to get married you know i'm just ending up being that creepy old guy hanging out in a bar you know red chest hair hanging out yes no seriously i don't know was uh what's wrong with me i just uh i i think i just stayed single too long man it's just brutal this is a critical point when you stay single too long then when your brain switches from uh you know like you know don't don't say that yeah  it say it see what happens dude and once you cross that line the evil that just just opens up it's just you know i don't know you know what i just find women that just like uh i think they're great i don't want this to come off like i don't come off here like i'm some woman hater because you know i know i'm a psycho but it's just like i don't i just find him to be like relentless just every day they just they just got to come at you they just wake up they have an agenda and they're like these psycho robots that never run out of batteries and everything just keep  god just keep coming at you right you got to deal with that every single day hey honey and you literally you know every day it's it's like waves hitting the beach you know every day just eroding a little more your life away you know just waking up inch by inch every day just why are you hanging out with him he drinks too much where'd you buy that that's ugly throw it out so one day you're just hanging out in the middle of a lagoon just floating there with your baseball cards you're waving to your friends back on the shore don't get me tickets i still like sports oh here she comes here she comes hey honey how are you doing no i'm trying to i'm trying to learn how to how to pick my battles with my girl you know it's what i am you know i used to argue all the time i'm just trying to pick the battles some days they they come at you you you just got to let them go you just let them go and follow them to whatever dumb  they want to do let's go get a picnic we'll have a picnic you bring the good bank and you're  other days you you just got to get your hand up you just got to just create this perimeter something for them to bounce off like man can you just send that psycho energy in another direction buy yourself a couple of hours for freedom before they bounce off something else gang can hang in they start coming back again they see my parents no they're relentless they never stop and there's no reason for them to stop you know why cause you can't hit him that's what it is think about that there's no physical ramifications for being an  when you're a woman do you know how much of it how much of a dick i would be if it was socially unacceptable to kick the  out of me dude i would be trashing everybody i saw see some big muscle bomb guy he go to the  gym slap his protein shake i'm saying hey go  yourself right but i can't do that right every guy has a line and if i cross the line i get blasted in the face totally acceptable right but with women there's no line they can just keep  just keep coming at you dude they can do stuff worthy of like a suplex and they'll just stand right next to it they don't have the decency to run away they'll like light your clothes on fire they're like ta-da i did that  oh yeah and i was so proud of my work i stuck around to see your reaction i invited a couple of friends to heckle you as you try to stomp it out with your bare feet oh yeah they'll like cue your car sign their name susan did this  you're sitting like now can i at least put her in a headlock give her a couple of  now i feel bad for women that you never get to feel that you guys should should do it to each other you know just every once in a while just haul off and just blast one of your friends in the face you know it's good for you no i know yeah i know it hurts you know you can't feel your nose your ears are ringing but i'm telling you man it clears your head and it causes you to like evaluate yourself i swear to god anytime i ever got punched in the face i was always pissed but at some point during the drive home i'd always be thinking like you know it's kind of being a dick back there you know and i really think about it i probably shouldn't have said that last  you know you'd like make that adjustment this guy's an  i can't believe he's just gonna say this kind of thing actually my girl punched me the head on valentine's day a few years ago yeah you want to hear this story this is a great one this is how much of a dick i am that i can actually tell a girl i love her give her a card and somehow at the end of the night she's still blasting me in the head you know i can't even remember what happened all i know is she said some  then i said some stuff then she said some more stuff and i said  it i'm going for big air i said the last  and next thing you know she just came flying at me right fist balled up okay and at first she was just hitting me all in here you know which is acceptable right it's a holiday let's  keep it nice you know let's keep it nice right and i gotta admit i was blocking most of it at first right i was doing the rope-a-dope i was leaning back i was pulling her head in i was leaning on her talking  trying to tire her out right and then all of a sudden she just went up top  bam it just hit me right in the side of the head you know what hurt the most was not that she hit me was that after she hit me she didn't have the decency to hop back like like maybe something was gonna happen she knew nothing was gonna happen it's against the rules so not only did she get to blast me in the head she then got to do like this ufc talking  thing in my face she's pointy oh it's brutal then she started like breaking up some stuff you know of course it was all my stuff and i'm just standing there okay don't look her in the eye stand as still as you can let her calm down oh that's great that's something mine from high school that meant a lot to me evidently not to you it's funny if i was doing that  i'd have a cop with his knee in my back but evidently you have a vagina so that makes it okay i just have to stand here as you break all my  i don't know it's got to be me it does you know i get into too many arguments i do i got gotta argue with this girl the other day you ever meet somebody like within the first couple of minutes of meeting them they feel like they can like sum you up just like you know what your problem is and you just have this unbelievable urge just to take their head and just mush it into whatever they're eating you know and really hold it there for a second you know like feel the panic in the back of their head is like the air bubbles become like less and less frequent you know you ever have like weird thoughts like that place random violent thoughts you know like i actually had the urge to elbow an old lady in the face the other day no it's unreal i swear to god man i was going i was going to get off a plane right you know the rules when you go to get off the plane it goes roll by row by row right and this lady's all like ooh i'm 90. i get to cut everybody right so she starts waddling around me you know i'm competitive i start boxing her out right start breaking down my luggage i swear to god i did this i'm literally taking up the whole aisle and all of a sudden i'll just go around him she just starts waddling all around me and then i just feel my elbow like dude you're going to take this  man come on dude you got a wide open shot you know just give her a quick one she's not going to feel it she's going to go down then you can play it off like oh is she with you is that happening  but i didn't do it man i got my body under control like come on man we can't do this  this is wrong and i thought i was in control and then she got like right about there then i felt my like my foot going too we can still trip her you're still tripping man just throwing that out there  all the time i do i didn't do it so we just went oh i didn't i didn't just you never think  like that you never just walk down the street see somebody up on a ladder you just want to go over just for fun just shaking it just to do it you see people like eating you know sidewalk cafe having a good time knock all this  off that's all i'm saying that's all i'm saying it was just it was one of one of those moments this girl was annoying me she was eating something and i was envisioning plunging her face right into it all right this is basically what happened okay she tried to say i was homophobic i think she's full of  and this is the story all right we were in a diner right we just got done eating okay came out i was looking down at the ground and when i looked up there was like these two dudes like hardcore making out you know and it's like i wasn't  ready you know what i mean i it was all it was i wasn't ready it's like you know if you rent a brokeback mountain or i'm walking through the village i can get my brain prepared for what i might see but it's like i wasn't  ready you know what i just eaten these fries my god you dumb  you got to go to the gym you know it's in my own head but when i looked up these two dudes one guy had a beard there's ah she's going at it so the second i looked up i just went like uh i just looked away that's all i did real quick i just and then this girl was just glaring at me like oh my god what's what's that what's that were you like homophobic are you homophobic i'm going no no homophobic i got no hatred you know i got no hatred in that area she goes what was that all about i got i i was it was just like a visual thing it was just you know she goes what are you talking about well put it this way the first time i ever saw a porno i was like 14 years old i had no idea what doggy style was but the second i saw it my brain was just like that is the  i want to  do that at some point in my life i'm gonna convince a woman to do that with me right my brain was like yes my dick was up everything was in agreement that this was a wonderful thing and i had no idea what it was but in the same token if at any point during that porno if somebody started like kissing somebody's feet or like sucking on their toes it was just it was just gross to me but that doesn't mean i hate feet and i don't want them in my neighborhood that just means i'm not into that  it's the same thing with the gators i have no hatred in my heart for gay people all right they're cool they're funny generally speaking they're neat you know i got a lot of positive things to say about them you know they move to your neighborhood the property value goes up because they make it fabulous right they can't reproduce so they're not making more in the way people walking around looking up the  yeah they're wonderful for the environment god bless them but how far does political correctness go that i got to look at some  that's making my brain go like ah  look away right i'm supposed to override that start like cheering on the relationship like grab his ass yeah run your fingers through his chest hands  dude it's ridiculous you're gonna tell me some gay guy never walked down the street seen two straight straight people just going at it and never just saw like oh god why would judges had to like walk it off he can't help it that's just how his brain is wired right he's just like  and i'm like dick right but there's no hatred in that i can't i don't know i just couldn't  explain it to this girl she's like yeah i get your home fabric it's like no i was on the same level you ever see a big guy eating a sandwich right and he gets a little mustard on the side of his face right you  look away but that doesn't mean you want him to choke on the sandwich and you want to get a bunch of friends to beat the  out of him for eating the sandwich right dude whatever you put your mouth on is the most intimate thing ever right there's no middle ground it's either like yes or  that there's no middle there you know balls right  you just and you just insert yourself into the situation like when you watch a porno there's there's a guy and a girl but you're not looking at the guy even though he's right there you're just looking at the girl and you're just thinking yeah that's what i would be doing to her right but if you took the girl out and there was just some guy just sitting there just dry humping you'd be like this  is horrific right so when i'm looking at two dudes kissing it's like a stalemate there's no place for me to insert myself into that situation that isn't horrific right that mean i'm  up you know do i love about that joke you guys got it after like the first example yet i felt the need to give you 58 more so just got to get my  together man that's basically it started going back to therapy again i just can't i can i just can't do therapy i try i start telling my stories i just start  laughing and then the therapist is always looking at me like you know and i'm like come on man it's kind of funny right like no no it's really horrific so he's trying to get me to bring the walls down so you know i finally won therapy session you know i start getting a little emotional and then all of a sudden he goes he goes okay yeah just breathe and the second my brain was like ah what a douche and i just immediately just i just hate him though just the walls just came back up again you know i don't maybe i'm just fighting it you know maybe this is who the  i am i like corvettes you know maybe i should just be this should start making some more money you know you never think about this  i don't know how you guys how do you stay married how the  do you you do it i know you take the happy family photo it's just sitting there you know you never just think of that just someday you know just slam in the garage door in your head putting yourself in a coma for a couple of just all happy okay every down lisa is a happy crowd i'm the only one who thinks this  all right i don't know i like  up  man i like when crazy stuff happens i like stuff for like in sports i love watching sports like i love all this stuff like people cheating like with steroids you know i am so pro steroids it's ridiculous i could give a  i could really give a  you know i don't know what barry bonds is doing but whatever he's doing i hope he keeps doing it i hope he just comes out as like one big chest muscle with like a bat sticking out it just keeps cranking them over the fence you know  who gives a  dude people have been cheating since the beginning since i was watching baseball in the 70s half of them were on coke you don't think that that helps you see the ball a little better you like wired out of your mind like dude i can see every stitch it's a curveball i'm gonna  fight it 12th inning you're all  amped up this is the  man no i love all that stuff i like when you know people fall out of the upper deck when athletes punch people in the stands i mean that's just like what's entertaining for me now you know i like that jimmy the greek moment that happens in sports you know like once every four or five years you know that like some 50 55 year old white dude tries to explain why black people are kicking the  out of white people in practically every major sport you know and it always goes down the same way right there's always like three white dudes and the one white dude in the middle he's always like the guy with like the theory you know he's always okay you know it seems these uh these african-american athletes they are they seem to have this uh this quick twitch uh muscle farm you know there's a slow twitch and there's uh this quick twitch and the second the dude says that like the other two white dudes start like sliding out of frame like okay this guy's getting fired and i'm not going to be part of this highlight nice knowing your ned keep that seat warm right  and the dude in the middle he's just like hell-bent on getting fired you know he's just he starts like bringing up slavery and evidently they're reading the strongest man with the strongest woman in that quick twitch and literally 20 minutes later that dude's on tv is like fired right he's crying his family's standing there he's got like a box of  from his desk with like an emmy sticking out he's like i don't know what i'm saying i was just talking about the quick twitch and the slow twitch and it was wasn't just trying to make a point no i love that i love seeing people mess up their careers like that it's just funny to me plus i got to admit as a white dude on some level i have to believe in that theory because it's like a white dude's that bad at basketball i can't even watch the nba anymore man it's like every highlight the white dude's like that the black cube does like his nuts in his face  i'm just sitting at home like for the love of god tackle the god jesus christ get out of the way do you ever get tired of those two nuts flying over your head you know you're going to be on sportscenter just get out of the way dude i'm telling you there's got to be something to that theory i saw this show one time on runaway slaves it's one of the most amazing programs i've ever seen in my life dude when you ran away as a slave you just didn't run to the end of the driveway and be like ah  that job just start walking down the street dude you were to like run through whole states there's dogs chasing me you're hurtling  you're swimming those were the first  triathletes and there was nobody helping him out there was no dude on the side of the road like come on man two more statesmen in ohio step it up you're looking good looking good yeah you dude you were on your own is it any wonder 250 300 years of that  and then i'm gonna d you up in gym class it ain't happening i come from hundreds of years of alcoholics i got like half a liver you know what i mean it's just you know what's funny to me about that stuff you can't even like you know i always say you know that theory's crazy but it's just like you can't even bring up how well black people are doing in sports everybody gets all weird about it which i don't understand cause it's like a compliment you know like feel how weird it is right now you know i just brought that  up i'm saying something good right i said i saw a coach get in trouble for that  like his team was like oh and six or something they just couldn't win and every week the press was just getting on more and more and more right and the dude he was just like flustered and he had like a moment of honesty they were like why can't you guys win a game he's like oh you know oh the offense isn't getting it done you know defense you know too slow and i just run out tell me we've got to get some more black guys on this team but i'm telling you and immediately everybody's like everyone started freaking out like they had no idea what this dude was talking about it's like are you watching sportscenter or do you see the olympics like i love the 100 meter dash right there's always there's always like like like nine black dudes and that one token white guy in like lane eight i'm just sitting there going come on man one time just one time just win the bronze just do what you got to do the white dude always stays with him till like the first turn then he like  blows out his tammy those other eight black dudes left where's that white dude the next olympics he's like up in the broadcast booth his career is over this is where he's like a commentator yeah it's going to be a great race still can't feel my  toes but i'm telling you no i don't get it it's like a compliment we're saying you're fast that's a good thing right people start all freaking out you're acting like that's all we can do you're saying we can't be scientists no we're not all we're saying is if there was a race through the microscopes you  would win we're just saying that you're fast you get there first your lab coat would be flapping in the wind i'd get there like three minutes later all cramped up are you looking at bacteria no you go first you just go for it please there's a bubble a guy ran by a volvo in street shoes i've never seen that before my life no i get into those arguments all the time all the time friends of mine will be like well how come any time a black athlete does something they say it's an athletic move anytime a white athlete does it they say it's an intelligent move and it's like well fair enough man it just just depends on what you're doing you know what i mean it's like you know if you read a defense white or black that's an intelligent move right but if you take off from the foul line jump over nine other dudes and throw the  down those other nine guys aren't standing there like  why didn't i think of that  here i am dribbling around guys i could get some superhero  she had like a cake flapping in the wind with a big s on your chest i'm telling you man that's the funny thing about hitler just let me finish let me work my way let me work my way through this idea no that's my favorite my favorite sports clip is that jesse owens  i just love it because their whole angle was  up but he made hitler leave in like the third quarter right he's putting down his number one finger just  walking out of the stadium jesus christ the whole thing was like we are going to create a superior race it's like dude i think we accidentally already did that well we sent a select group of people to the gym every day for a couple hundred years that's paying dividends they're  dunking on us every day dude how quiet was that limo ride home with hitler you know what i'm saying you know he was talking crazy  when they were on the way there they were all amped up they are going through dominating high heels going off that whole ride home they're just sitting there all quiet you're sitting next to an even angrier than usual adolf hitler trying to make some sort of small talk like it is one nice day isn't it you know nice boots dude i gotta admit man i'm fascinated with hitler man i am just how the  that guy ever came in power because does he ever look like he's in a good mood in any of those clips everyone's just ah his  hair is flapping around there was nobody even in the beginning to be like dude is it me and this guy was this guy's going crazy huh those guys are kind of a spaz total  block you can't even have them around women or nothing you know no you know what is crazy people can take over  that's what it is like regular people i don't know you just never say  you ever notice that like you'd be on a bus 30 decent people one crazy dude can take over the whole bus right everybody's just sitting there everything's great then one crazy  just start screaming and the second that happens all 30 people like oh my god he was like up against him he's got hepatitis everybody's freaking out it's like why does everybody just pounce on the duke i think every regular person should just have like a chloroform rag like right in their front shirt pocket and the second any crazy  happens if you're behind it it's on you you just pull it out and you take the guy down everybody jumps on him you tie him up and you tattoo possibly the next hitler across your forehead you keep an eye on him right  nobody it's so hard it's just hard to speak up that's the  you know like i was in a target the other day right not bragging you know i what now i'm standing there with the buddy of mine right he's a bouncer he's a bouncer in this really like crazy bar so he knows like all these scumbags and it just so happens that one of them just so happens to come walking through the target so my buddy goes to wave to him like hey man how's it going and riding this guy being like ah you know it's going pretty good he just launches into this tirade about like like immigrants right in the middle of target he's like how's it going tell you how it's going goddamn mexicans keep coming to this country taking all the  jobs immediately everybody in line like ooh eminem let's be the back of these for a while wow look at that glucose is he still there i'm not looking i looked the last time it's your turn to look i am not looking you just look this guy was going off nobody did  including me including me i wasn't looking at the guy even the people who worked at target they just kept ringing stuff up like ooh three socks for a dollar that's amazing think it's gonna rain out  dude it was a classic chloroform moment this guy he was doing he was doing like a  hitler open mic you know he was just going off he was learning how to put thoughts together right how to speak in front of groups somebody should just came up you know threw some skittles on the ground you take them out that's it it's over but nobody did  you knew there was like one guy working at target like some crazy dude peeking out from the back like i like this guy this guy's making a lot of sense right and he follows him out to the parking lot they jump in his el camino now there's two of them right i don't know i'm into uh conspiracy theory man that's my thing you guys into that  you read that stuff i do i think fast food fast food i think is like a conspiracy you know i think that's how they just keep us dumb you can't even think after a while you haven't noticed that  like you have your whole day planned out eat one egg mcmuffin you just on the couch yeah you know what  my dreams been laying here for a while gotta stretch out have a good time dude it's unbelievable healthy food you can't you can't even smell it you have a bag of apples right in front of my face like my eyes are closed i can't smell it 200 miles away oh  is that is that kfc you want to get some chicken well then you get a bucket of it i'll tell you never notice that you even notice whenever the government  up all of a sudden like mcdonald's has like a new sandwich you know you're just sitting there screaming at your tv how can i get pardon all these ceos new mcrib i'm gonna  turn it shove it down your face so anyways yeah so i have a lot of like uh have a lot of  up thoughts man i do this is the most recent one i had you ever drive down the street and see like 30 people up on the sidewalk and you just think right you don't do it you just think it that's what's like separates the psychos from the functioning psychos right psychos they just thinking  it they do it they get the wipers going they make a day out of it right but as a functioning psycho not only do you not do it you actually analyze it like man if i just leave my hand right here nobody knows who i am i move it two degrees over here i'm on the cover of newsweek i am instantly famous right right here nobody knows me just a regular jackass like hey bill you want to come to the cookout you know maybe you could bring that that potato salad it was such a big hit last year one of the most horrific scenes we've seen in here bottles just screwing about you should really go there amy's gonna be there you can strike up the conversation maybe hook up with her no indication he even tried to stop  no i have those thoughts all the time like recently my girl took me to a street fair right you guys ever met a street fair you know they closed off the block right they closed off the block there's like shawarma there's like  made out of buttons right people with no teeth are making keychains you know it's a typical girlfriend idea it sucks and it's gonna take all saturday right right she's like all excited she's like swinging my arm oh my god this is gonna be  great right i'm like praying for lightning some sort of scaffolding to fall down on my head you know so she comes up first place she comes up to is is this big table nothing but like homemade jewelry right homemade jewelry okay it's got twigs in it macaroni it's  it is a table of  right but she loves it right she was like oh my god this stuff is so funky right she's like trying on the earrings do you like these do you think these are nice right i want to be like no if they were nice they'd be in a store all right there'd be a roof some sort of structure would be built around this this is  this is a table of  right oh brutal right but but i don't want to be a dick so i'm like no honey that's great you know john you know i'm gonna go get some air okay even though we're outside i think there's more air to be had you know as love as i felt it i was gonna snap i literally watched like two three tables of williams this lady standing there with this big table and nothing but muffins right homemade muffins it's like 85 degrees out she's standing there with this big table nothing but muffins she's got this big stupid look at the muffins i made look at her face and the second i saw that  that part of my brain was just like dude what would happen if you just came up and just said hey lady are these your muffins oh yeah i just started going  like how many of these muffins could i mush before anybody did anything i mean realistically i think i could have got the whole table because even if you saw me doing that  it would take at least five to six seconds to process like did they say you can do that is it like the game do you eat the muffin off your fish that just seems like a waste of pastry you know dude there's no security of  like that there's no dude standing there he's mushing the muffins okay i'm on it sir we're gonna have to ask you to leave they just choked me out so i just started thinking of the horrified  up look in this lady's face as i started slamming these muffins and out of nowhere i just started laughing like a mania i'm like slumped over this fried dough card i'm dying my girl looks at me she's like what the hell are you laughing at and like an idiot i actually tried to explain this  up thought to her like she was gonna get it on some level right i'm just sitting there like i was just thinking what if i started punching the muffins you know what i mean i just started punching him and she's just looking at me like why do i go out with you dude but i swear to god man if i never broke eye contact the second i started hitting those things that girl wouldn't even be able to call for help i would have been in her head it would have been too personal she'd be like did i go to high school with this guy why would you do that muffins are a happy food i don't understand it all right listen i'm out of time you guys are so much fun thank you so much for coming out i really

that's so brave that's so courageous i'm not saying it doesn't take balls but that's a bit of an overreach with the word brave right like what am i supposed to do if ever see a fireman running out of a building carrying a baby and an old lady am i gonna sit there like oh my god you're like a fat actress that takes her shirt off to do a magazine shoot to promote the movie she's in hello i know

can't  stop eating pork chops that's something you have to  deal with i don't have to completely rewire myself you know what it is it's just a bunch of sixes pissed off that they're not getting treated like a tent you know at some point you just got to acknowledge what you are you're a six i'm sorry all right nobody jerks off to a six that's the deal unless you work with her you work with her you know she's got that one outfit you know it just does something for you you're working close quarters so this you know what a shampoo smells like there's an intimacy there's an intimacy there all right i don't know what women rub one out too but i know it ain't me all right this is a fantasy that's why i don't feel bad about trashing them it's like yeah this is all coming from i'm a strong five all right that's where i am so i still feel like i'm punching up here you know honestly people i'm a bald redheaded male you don't think there's a glass ceiling on the kinds of parts i can get in hollywood really do you think i'm ever going to be the lead in a romantic comedy that ain't happening here if i'm booking the movie i want to make the money back that's the thing that's it's show business there's a million dollars on this film okay we're trying to make  money you just want to show up with  crumbs on the side of your face show up in shape looking as  as possible know your lines ready to work it's called being a professional right dude ben stiller had abs and meet the parents there was no reason for him to do that he just knew i'm gonna take my  shirt off i don't want to get trashed he was shredded nick i'll be a  postman i mean i don't know what to tell you all now right know what it is it's just the ramblings of someone who's sliding in to the back nine of his life and i'm not understanding half the  that's going on you know but you know one of the big things that really made me feel old was when mcdonald's started making salads that literally ripped my heart out i'm like they're doing what what now they have raps and they're doing all of this  you know what it was was i shake people complain to them that you're like oh you don't have any healthy options it's like this is mcdonald's this  is poison who the  comes here to get in shape whenever i get mcdonald's i have a whole plan at my age i'm 48 years old i know what i'm gonna order i'm going to go in there it's going to taste great 20 minutes later i'm going to want to kill myself and then i'm going to go to the gym tomorrow i'm going to the gym tomorrow and no matter how much i say that i woke up the demon in me i woke up the demon and all that grease is just coursing through my veins and no matter how much i want to go to the gym there's going to be this other voice going dude get an egg mcmuffin go down there and get an egg mcmuffin and i'm going to sit up like the manchurian candidate okay we're going to mcdonald's this my in-shape voice is in the background now what are we doing go to the jab and i just  i'm gonna drive right down right i know what it is but somehow out of shape people somehow got that made them that they had a  blame they had to have more healthy  because they're the reason why everybody's fat how come they have to do it what about ben and jerry's how come they have to put a little kale in their ice cream why is that oh cause you're a couple of hippies man they're like making ice cream they're going after big bad mcdonald's you know it's just who the  goes to mcdonald's to get in shape don't give me that horseshit that eating healthy is is is expensive it isn't go to a  supermarket they're throwing the vegetables at you it's celery get the  out of here 70 cents 25 cents for a banana whatever the  you want get it out of here before it goes bad no it's  up they somehow convinced them that that you know mcdonald's is the reason why i'm out of shape i would have got a salad but you didn't have the option so i was like well i guess i gotta get 52 big macs thanks a lot mcdonald's it's like dude you're an adult it's not their job to babysit you they're a  business if you order 50 sandwiches they're going to give it to you it's your job to not do it you're  dope right sorry i know yeah dude mcdonald's mcdonald's exists for two reasons okay it's for drunk people and it's for children all right that's what this thing is you know you're in your car your kids won't shut the hell up you go to the drive-through you go to the drive-through you get a couple of poison burgers you throw it down their throats their little systems can't handle it they start you start nodding off and you're up front you're bigger you can handle a bigger dose of poison you know what i mean pop in your death leopard cassette you have a little moment for yourself yeah that's what it's for it's for your kids and it's for drunk people like how many times have you driven out to a bargain i'm just gonna have one all of a sudden you had like 11 right and you're hammered and you're thinking but you know what you're responsible you're drunk but you're responsible you're like god damn it i drove my car here tonight god damn it i'm driving it up all right i'm not gonna burden this place of business by taking up a parking space in this completely empty parking lot for the next six hours i am not advocating drinking and driving but i will tell you there's nothing better than when all your friends and family know you're hammered there's nothing better than that walk to the car it's incredible women are screaming people tearing at your clothes you feel like you're in the beatles oh my god no stop and be like no autographs i'm sorry i have to go i'll be back get him off me and you kick you get in the car and everybody's screaming get in the  car you're fine i had a car eight years i know i can almost see my house just get in the  car you gotta make the cops come get in the  i swear to god just get in the  car  oh take your seat belt off you  mary i'm going right down the street right and then what happens you get out on the road you realize you're way more hammered than you thought who was always there for you mcdonald's with the drive-thru a 24-hour drive-thru you could just pull in and hide in plain sight right and then a little sad traffic jam of divorcees shut-ins people who go to comic-con right you just pull in and just stop you can take a little nap  it's like damn thank you thank you you pull around that's what it was all about and all of a sudden they're the reason this country's out of shape you know they've had mcdonald's my whole life people weren't this  fat right it's not their fault you can't pin it on them but mcdonald's  up they  up because they gave in to out of shape people and they said all right fine fine it's our fault we'll start making salads and then they got on their heels they got on their heels everybody sensed it and now look at them okay four or five years later now they got to make they got to make breakfast all day right  because you know what happened all the potheads showed up going well hey man if you're gonna make him a salad like like what if i want like a breakfast thingy and it's like it's not breakfast like you're gonna hook him up but you're not gonna hook me up that's that's like food racism or something man i just don't understand like fine we'll start making we'll make the breakfast they just completely lost their way i swear to god dude if i was running that corporation this is what i would do you know what i do i bring that clown back all right i bring the clown back okay and i just have that thing just look right down the barrel of the camera have a little bit of dry ice in the background you just come right in tight on his face he just looks right in the camera and just goes look if you can't get your fat ass down here by 10 30 in the morning you're getting a burger all right  i'm not making pancakes at three o'clock in the afternoon cause you didn't blow all night with your friends and you're just getting your  together all right make no mistake this is a burger joint it's always been a burger joint we did that breakfast thing as a favor you know we're just trying to freak out ihop oh we're doing it too we're doing it too your own mother will make your pancakes at three o'clock in the afternoon okay so get your fat ass or your drugged up ass down here before 10 30. we decide it's our place we tell you what the  we're making all right that's it  so anyways by the time this special comes out another election will have come and gone it's just god knows who we picked and it's another one they're not going to  talk about anything oceans are dying they just said the great barrier reef is dead you know genetically altered food there's too many  people i don't even know what they're just talking about a bunch of  you know bruce has to drop a deuce where is he gonna go which bathroom should this guy it's like i don't give a  this guy has enough money to literally have a porta-potty rickshaw running behind him  how are you going to eliminate a couple billion  people you never think about that  you know they never talk to us about it you know they talk about it behind closed doors right a bunch of creepy dudes all sitting around some giant table right they probably talk about it then just sitting down after i trust everyone had their fun let's get down to the task at hand there are over 7.5 million people on the planet we're running out of fresh water there won't be enough chicken to feed the others does anyone hear any of any suggestions on how to eliminate the pressures of the undesirables  is you number four you may speak well you know what uh what if we like slowly cooked him at the airport you know no just throwing it out there what if you had like a revolving door looking thing you made them take their shoes off they got in and they they stood up like that and you just radiate them from head to toe once on the way out once on the way back oh yes yes i like that i like the sound of that and how would that work would you have it on loan first sear them like a tuna steak they don't understand you let the children go we'll use them for slaves later right no old people they'll die soon just people in the prime of their life and gradually over the years you increase it you increase it they still frothing at the mouth they don't recognize the children the property comes back to us oh i trusted everyone at this table flash private  dude my wife thinks i'm out of my mind cause i think  like that but i think i'm right dude i know they think about it i know they think about it because i think about it every time i land in a city and it's two o'clock in the afternoon i'm just driving down the street and i see all these i'm in the middle of a  traffic jam that inner mussolini comes out of me right like what are all these people doing in my road you must be eliminated i don't know like how do you not  bring it up is because it would freak everybody out you know that you have to start maybe taking some measures to start thinning out the herd you feel like you feel that creepy will you that's right that's right yeah and what do you think dude you think you're gonna you think you're in the  upper tier you're in the you're in the luxury boxes yeah you spend a lot of time with yourself you you're doing a lot of nod and i i like what i think i like what i think a lot well i think it's the way it should be i understand what that's like i live this  isolated life man i go on the road i'm in green rooms and i just  you know just by myself all the time you slowly go  crazy i did a gig recently i was in ireland and i was in the green room by myself and i went to turn on the light it was one of those pull switches and it wound up around itself looked like a little noose and i immediately just thought what if i just stuck my head in there and just turned the lights out literally and figuratively was not thinking about killing myself at all the second i thought oh what if i just  did that and then i looked in the mirror i caught my eye and we both laughed yeah i had this wonderful little moment with myself no words needed to be spoken you know  yeah so i think about the population all the times you've been telling on my specials i'm always talking about it i think i got the plan because i know no no no wait do you hear the plan first because a lot of people are gonna die before you start hooting and hollering everybody thinks they're gonna  make it right this is how you do it that's how i would do it okay first of all you gotta become a dictator okay because it's too late to try to be like well hey man maybe just have a couple it's too  late someone's got to have the balls to take out the sickle start chopping some heads so here's my idea i become dictator when you become dictator obviously you got to murder everybody in power right from the head all the way down to that goldfish you got to kill everyone in the family so they don't come back for their revenge like in godfather 2 or every karate movie you've ever seen right you got to do it the way the russians did it where you don't find the skulls for 100  years that's the way you do it then you take control of the media i keep all you guys media blacked out you don't know what's going on unless i want you to know it right big pictures of me you got to sing songs about me if there's no passion in it a black fan pulls up and you're never seen from again all right figure three to six months of that everybody gets on the same page and that's when i start thinning it out this is how i would do it i would just start randomly sinking cruise ships just hear me out it's the way to go it's the way to go you get 2500 to 3 000 people of whack and i think it's a really good mix of people to get rid of  you know think about the kinds of people that take a cruise these aren't forward thinkers these aren't seekers they're not pivotal to our survival you ever hear somebody coming back from a cruise it's one of the worst stories you're ever gonna hear cause they don't do  they don't wanna travel to another country interact with the new culture try to figure out the train system of the money all they want to do is just sit on a  boat just drinking that's all they want to do right worst story you'll ever hear hey how was your cruise oh was great i was  laying there there was a dj over here on the one and a two wooka wooka thing right and then they had this chocolate fountain it was like a foul but it was chocolate and you stuck the toothpick in the food and you stuck it in the chocolate and you stuck it in your mouth and then you'd be like i wanted a drink and you bring it all you drink it and dribble down and it gathers in your navel or you punch yourself you get in your mouth  then every day around noon we line up for lunch what's the lunch we don't know we don't make decisions whatever they give us i like all inclusive you just have to think once can i write that number on this piece of paper all right tell me where to go i'm telling you if you guys could just get past the humanity of what i am suggesting if you could just get past it and maybe lose a couple of friends here or there i'm telling you you wouldn't miss them you wouldn't make you know when you'd miss them when you when you went to when you went to a baseball game and there wasn't those hundred people in the upper deck trying to get the wave going right  you wouldn't have people getting mad because someone's sitting down during a song like that's offensive to me even though i don't know the issue right nashville a little pull back on that one a little pulled back it's about police brutality has nothing to do with you and your beautiful white world and mine right just let it go i don't give a  if you watched every episode of mchale's navy this is still not about you it's not a military issue i'm telling you you wouldn't  miss them this is the deal all right i wouldn't just give the order to start syncing these cruise ships and then retired in my chambers with my mistresses my  right just banging away wearing the whole uniform the whole dictator uniform everything except for the pants right compression socks with sock guards just banging away my underwear metal is just clanging off my chest the big thing is to see how long i could  keep the hat on like yeah yeah yeah i can't do that that breeds resentment amongst your men you got to lead them into battle and i would i would i'd have my own sub all right i'd have my own sub and i would hunt these cruise ships on a moonlit summer night that's right on a moonlit summer night when sound carries you know you know those summer nights when your neighbor's talking about you doesn't think you can hear them you're sitting on your porch going like oh yeah is that how it is so that's how it is right one of those nights and i'd be a sport about it i surfaced before i did it i'm armed they're not it's only fair right they see me i give a little wink little knot i'd have a little red baron class all right get the  out of here right but if you didn't see me it'd be game on and every moonlit summer night every summer i go out to harvest right that would be the deal i would just surface listen fawzi music yeah  fire one  dude look at my arm on this tank top  and then you cruise over you strafe all the survivors we'll figure it out   that would be it twenty five hundred to three thousand less people and you want screen to sing no it's all underwater all the evidence is gone all the evidence is gone every mass murderer throughout time is  up they did it on land you're gonna get caught where you're gonna put all of that right you do it out to sea it all goes under you know nobody knows i don't know what happened i have no idea right no evidence no evidence maybe maybe like a flip-flop right like an ed hardy shirt just by i'm controlling the media nobody knows about it right and as i sank the ships i would be building exact replicas at the same time right so i'd be eliminating people while creating jobs you guys have no  idea what's going on only you're just realizing like wow man the traffic's easing up i'm getting into third gear at five o'clock at night this is crazy this isn't me i don't know what's going on with this bill guys all right you know another buddy of mine got a job building ships can you  believe that that industry is just blowing up but that's it's crazy dude i want to get a job down there they're paying great you know make a little extra money then who knows maybe you and me take a cruise that was that's how it worked that's how my ethnic cleansing would work it wouldn't be based on race or religion it'd just be based on people dumb enough to think that taking a cruise is actually traveling technically you're traveling you know but what are you seeing just a bunch look at the water oh my god you can tell that's the atlantic ocean that definitely does not look like the pacific ocean  so yeah look admittedly i'm a  psycho and i i am dude i have dreams i just i had a dream two years ago that still haunts me you know you ever have one of those dreams where you think you woke up but you didn't you know you're just sitting up and it feels like your house i had one of those drinks right so when i just i sat up in bed and i looked over and there was this little girl in the corner room no idea who she was she was like three four years old and she was talking to me but i couldn't understand what she was saying she was just standing in the corner just going hey  i was like what what what'd you say i i can't hear you sweetheart you got to come a little closer she walked like halfway to the bed she's like not on your head just got hey big like the grudge eyes i'm just like you gotta you gotta come closer she walks all the way up to the bed she's like i couldn't hear you sweetheart what'd you say what did you say she just nods and just goes you're gonna kill yourself i just said i'm like like no i'm not no i am not my wife wakes up what's the matter like i just had like the most scary dream i've ever had in my life it was horrible she's like was i in it no you're self-centered jackass jesus christ not everything is about you sweetheart i love you but it's not all about you but shut up i tried to go to sleep in the same position so i'd run into that little girl again so i could just be look you little  you don't go around saying that to people i'm not gonna kill myself i don't know what that dream meant you know because you're dreaming metaphors man you know i don't it just freaks me out though you know disturbs my wife and  but you know there is one good thing about being a psycho you know one of the great things about being a psycho is you can spot another psycho from a mile away you know that's really great i can spot him you know it's in the ice never look at the costume nice people look at the costume they'll see somebody like dad jeans you know pushing their kid on the swing you know the whole nerdy sweater hey how you doing you believe the summer's already over i mean this is crazy right oh this one here this one here has got me running around you know she's running the house he's running the house  people always like oh my god he's so nice such a great family man and i'm just sitting thinking my head like dude that guy is a  psycho he's a psycho look at his eyes you don't see that that dude is barely hanging on he's white knuckling it through all the  he thinks he's supposed to do all that  guy needs all he needs he just needs a little nudge that's it just a little nudge you have no idea what that guy's capable of i would not want to see the hard drive of that man's computer i'm telling you yeah so i do it all the time i'm pretty good at picking out psychos and it drives my wife nuts like i remember like she was one of the first people that got into kanye west right the great kanye west everybody loves him and stuff right oh shut up jesus christ why did i come to nashville oh it's a black artist you're bringing it up in the rhyming what the  it's a grand ole opry man it's not mtv raps but i'm stereotyping you i'm acting like because you're from the south that automatically you're racist like all the racists are just down here that isn't true they're they you know they're all over the place  it's just different degrees right like me i'm racist like at the end of the day like i'm a great  guy i don't give a  who you are in the morning you're eating your cereal hey what's going on but as the sun starts to go down and the fear starts coming up that's when you start thinking the worst of people right i know nobody's going to be honest i don't give a  who you are 12 midnight in a parking garage by yourself whatever is walking at you there's no happy thoughts you're not thinking like oh that guy he just he's probably uh he's probably building a website and uh you're not thinking that that dude's gonna cut me up eat me whatever he doesn't eat he's gonna  that's what you think right all right but if you do that at night that's normal i think because it's fear it's it's the people at breakfast that are already just sitting there like  jews you know that's what you got an issue so so anyway i just got to do this you know when you talk about racing that type of  you know it's a white dude you just got to go easy you know it's very easily it starts feeling like a meeting you know whenever i start here like yeah all right let's go all right i got to pull back a little bit people aren't seeing what i'm saying i wore a country shirt things are getting a little off the rails here can i get back to kanye west half of you probably downloaded this  all right all right here we go so my wife got freaked out because i told him like she was early on she was loving the guy and and i i was thinking i think he was cool then one day i saw him do an interview and he was talking  about how great he was and there was just this look that was in his eye and it just made me nervous i'm like dude this guy is uh this guy is like this guy's volatile man there's something with this guy he's making me nervous this guy is like right on the edge of like snapping right she goes ah you're out of your mind and i was thinking i don't know i don't know i think this guy's  up and then i was convinced because one day i came walking in and she was listening to him doing an interview and i didn't know it was him and he was just in the middle of talking about how great he was and i came walking in and all he did was hear this  and like literally a chill ran down my spine and i just started thinking like no no no and i turned and i looked before it even registered that it was kanye my first thought was oh thank god oh thank god it's just a black guy ah thank god  it's just a black guy yeah you're right to pull back this is right to get awkward here because you don't know where this could go this could very easily go in a clannish direction okay so just let me clarify just hear me out i'm thinking thank god it's a black guy meaning thank god that ego that is in him when that thing floated down from the heavens or the cosmos whatever the hell joel osteen  you believe all right when that thing was floating down it could have landed in anybody thank god it landed in a black guy thank god it got wrapped up in that trapped within that it's safe in there no reason to worry when it's in there because if that ego however had floated down and landed in a blue-eyed white dude there is no telling the damage that could have been done you're talking entire civilizations wiped out worldwide famine the moon colliding with the earth thank god that ego landed in a black guy because he's just as nuts as some of the craziest white dudes of all time he just doesn't have the opportunity to follow through with the madness right yeah there's a glass ceiling on evil you never notice that  dude go home put on the history channel like the top nine out of ten most batshit crazy dudes who ever walk to earth are all white dudes now why is that cause white dudes are more evil than anybody else it's a possibility it's a possibility we definitely got the numbers but i think it's different i just think you notice nobody's watching white dudes all right white dudes don't too many of them gather and somebody pulls up all right break it up keep it moving get out of here get pulled over for no  reason none of that  you're a white dude it's just an open field anything you think hey i'm gonna do that no one's stopping you just yeah you just start running next thing you know you're handing out buttons you got your own uniform you're starting a  war right  all kanye west is allowed to do is  up an award show every three to four years make a public service announcement a little awkward for mike myers that's as far as he's ever gonna get i know i know you don't believe me dude okay next time kanye's going off on himself i'm telling you just close your eyes forget it's him and really listen to what is coming out of this guy's mouth he says  like i'm a genius i'm a god i'm shakespeare my biggest regret is i'll never get to see myself perform live that's a direct quote my biggest regret is i'll never get to see myself perform live dude you put that ego in a white dude that is it benign in this thrison what's the blitzkrieg what's the superior ace vienna will return to deutschland first oh i'm telling you but we're okay we're okay it's in a black guy nothing's gonna happen you never notice that  crazy black guy says the far as they can get they can just freak people out on the subway they can stand on a street corner with their book and their friends just yelling about white people these people they got tails the  got tails they're evil he just crossed the street that's it in a perfect world hitler never would have made it past the subway level that's as far as he ever would have got you would have just been sitting on the train hey what are you gonna do tonight i play a little fantasy football i don't know and the door just opened he just come walking through once this  has the blue eyes and some blonde hair and the pubes like the sun and you're just sitting there like okay just ignore him just ignore him let him pass through let him pass through and he'd just walk into the other part of the train literally a world war just passing through but he was a white dude no one watched him and his hair was flopping around and nobody gave a  all right so that's kind of like the weird lesson that i learned with kanye west you know like every once in a while racism works like 99.9 of the time it's the ugliest thing we do to one another but every once in a while we get lucky and then marble it just it rolls into the right hole and we get off easy we get off easy with that guy i got to commend you guys you did well with the hitler reference you did all right nothing quiets a room like dropping the h-bump you bring up adolf hitler it gets  quiet to this day this dude  he he died like what 75  years ago allegedly you know some people think he went down to south america on fire they're so brown right for the rest of his life at this point even if he lived he's  dead right we can go with that right but still to this day though even though he died let's say 75  years ago he's still the benchmark for evil have you ever noticed that he is the reference anytime you want to say somebody's evil you just say he is the next hitler donald trump he's the next hitler saddam hussein he's the next hitler it's always he's the next hitler okay i don't know what the  they used to say before hitler came around right he's the next genghis khan he's the next napoleon i don't know i'm in the terrible i don't know what they said but whatever they used to say he wiped them all out he was so  up it's like what they did didn't even exist anymore all right it's like when michael jordan came into the nba he was so  good he wiped out everyone no one ever goes he's the next doctor jay he's the next wilt no one says that it's always he's the next mike right adolf hitler is the michael jordan of evil he is like nike literally should have made him a sneaker like like a giant  boot you know it's all stiff around your knees so you get that walk going down right like if there was an evil hall of fame you got to put hitler in he's first ballot hall of fame evil okay undeniable stats he's got the career numbers you know six to nine million dingers you're getting in you're getting it  ah people it's a sports analogy i'm not advocating what the man did can we all be adults here all right am i going to be on a split screen tomorrow morning with some blogger some good morning nashville show comedy can it go too far last night at the ryman theater making fun of fat people sinking cruise ships was all fine suddenly it took a horrible horrible turn fortunately local blogger maggie magenhall was on the scene maggie can you describe what you were subjected to during last night's horrible rant well first of all everybody who knows me knows i have a great sense of humor i think this is funny i think that is funny but that last night that was not fun it always goes down like that they always have to establish what a wonderful sense of humor they have no it's a sports analogy okay six to nine million he got all of that one he had power from both sides of the plate he'd have his own  wing okay but this is what kills me about hitler killed six to nine million people meanwhile stalin killed 20 to 25 million basically over the exact same period okay yet he cannot get arrested in the conversation of most  up dude who ever walked the planet it's always he's the next hitler he's the next hitler how many how many  people do you have to kill just to get a little shout out a little tip with the cat what do you think of this guy it's always he's the next hitler how about everyone's live this guy is a little stalin-esque i see a little jojo in this guy right he almost tripled his  numbers he gets brought up like he was a backup why don't his kills count does anybody anybody why doesn't his  kills count i don't care is is it because he just looked like some regular guy like your neighbor you know driving a little john deere hey i just killed a million ukrainians meet me just drives around his yard is that what it is i think it is hitler just i don't know he just looked apart he's like from central casting you couldn't pick a more evil looking dude like go home tonight google pictures of adolf hitler get put on the same watch list that i'm on all right i'm telling you there's not one cute picture of that guy his whole life it's just all pure evil there's no like teenage like boy band years like you google a picture and ate off as a baby you look at that thing you're like dude drown that  thing drown it take it down to the river stick it under a rock if you don't do it i'm gonna  do it i swear to god it's looking at me i would kick it right in its baby chest and feel no guilt whatsoever dude hitler is actually so evil he actually makes me want to learn how to speak german you know what i mean because i just want to know like what the  was he saying to those people every speech he's so clearly out of his  mind it's got to be what he's saying the  did he say there's no way he said what he planned on doing from the get-go some unknown candidate right early on okay our next speaker coming to the stage to possibly run deutschland for the foreseeable future his name is um oh dear i left my glasses backstage is is that alan is it alan oh adolf adolph okay oh okay okay this guy's got a bee in his bonnet okay please welcome adolf hitler he got three minutes buddy we're not going to kill millions of people i know what they should look like the eyeballs center the beat of the butt i have the ovens for the rest of the people dude you can't come out of the gates talk in a crowd like that you're gonna freak him out you can't go that hard in the beginning you know you can do that in the woods with a couple of drinking buddies freaking people out like hey matt relax this girl's here jesus christ i think i got a shot here i'm trying to get laid can you just be a wingman for once in your life dude can you just be a  just bring the energy down nobody gives a  about your  theories okay just be a chill guy you got  on the side of your mouth and either grow a mustache or don't you look ridiculous i'm sorry ladies he gets a little excited you know what i think he was doing i think he was just i think he was just being a crowd-pleasing hack fired a guest he's just telling those germans what they wanted to hear once we have the best cars we have the best women october festivals of  these are shooting free t-shirts up  armbands right i don't know it's just something that's always bothered me not always just recently i'm just going like this guy kills six to  nine everybody's we definitely don't want another one of those but what about this guy 20 to  25 you know you know what it is there's probably a couple of egghead history majors out there going well bill if we're gonna go around the world you know what about that dude mao from china he allegedly killed 50 to 60 million people what about that guy how come you don't bring him up simple i don't count those kills i don't i don't count them dude there's like a billion people in china you wipe out on a scooter you're gonna kill 80 not even trying  50 to 60 million that's like steroid aerostats it's like get the  out of here what are you on come on i'm supposed to believe that number that's like when a second base would have like 50 jacks it's like dude you had 20 in high school get the  out of here 50 home runs i don't get it i just don't get why you're not really feeling whenever i do this bit i always feel the crowd you guys just you just don't like a sports analogy you know let's go music all right it's nashville look at it in a musical way all right okay hitler drops an album he sells six to nine million copies all right he's got a couple of summertime jams maybe a prom song he just catches a moment he has his own dance like gangnam style except you know it's got a little more with the hands right it's more of an upper body song  then later on that summer stalin drops his new  he sells 20 to 25 million copies 20 to 25 million copies is michael jackson thriller okay one of the greatest artists one of the greatest albums of all time six to nine million in sales that's like hootie and the blowfish crack rearview mirror now if you guys were at home in your apartment or your  barn whatever it is you do down here sitting there with your lantern uh and you're sound asleep next to your favorite bale of hate you're sound asleep and someone came running in at three in the morning go dude you got to run down to the bar it's the next michael jackson i swear to god you would consider it michael jackson i gotta  see that you'd actually maybe get it but if somebody came running and woke you up like dude you got to see this guy he's the next hoarder you're the blowfish right you'd smash him over the head with your  lantern or whatever the hell you got in there  why don't his  kills come dude stalin he even killed his own friends hitler didn't even do that dude you go duck hunting with style and you thought you were in with them he's taking pictures with you and  it's all  good right then like a week later you parted your hair a little bit different he got paranoid and that was it he whacked you that's it not only that he then had you erased out of the photo you know next thing you know stalin's like hugging a tree or some  like that this guy was photoshopping people out of photos like 60 years before the technology existed he changed the  game yeah so i watched a lot of the youtube videos right so the other night my wife lovely wife she's like falling asleep and i can't fall asleep because i'm all scatterbrained so i just start watching some youtube clips okay i ended up seeing this clip of this lady down at the zoo all right this lady down to zoo who i'm sure wasn't making as much money as the guy who worked at the zoo and that's what needs to stop  hey ladies you ever think of opening your own zoo you know is there a reason you wait till we build the whole  thing and then then you're gonna show up when all the hard work is done all the animals are captured then you're gonna hey where's my  corner office yeah start your own  soup go out go catch a cobra see how that is  it's not the point of the story i just like i just like being a dick sometimes so this lady down to zoo this lady down to sue she taught this gorilla how to do sign language okay and i don't just mean like hello and goodbye like literally phrases this thing could like like talk about its emotions they were actually conversing the british sitting there talking oh my god you look a little upset today and she's like oh you know i'm kind of sad and they're just talking so immediately like my brain just went  crazy i was like oh my god she's talking to a gorilla i love gorillas who doesn't want to talk to a gorilla and then without thinking that my wife is sleeping i just blurted out ask it how much it can bench ask it on the chicken bench my wife like pops up she's like what are you doing i'm like look at this look at this she's talking to a gorilla and we both just got sucked into this thing right it's a long story short she's sitting there she's talking to this gorilla and one day she decides to get his little kitten little kitty cat right and immediately i'm thinking like don't get it a cat it's a gorilla it's going to twist the thing's head off throw the body over there play with the head for a while sniffing it and stuff and later it's gonna walk over set the head down next to the body and wonder why the whole thing's not getting up again because it's a  gorilla it's a wild animal wild animals don't have pets right it's killer be killed out there that's it they don't have little parakeets on their shoulders and  but it was the exact opposite she gives it this little kitten and the thing immediately understood that it was a baby and this like parental thing came over it was so like gentle and filled with joy and just it was like beautiful right and then they just understood that they love this kid and they started using it as like a teaching tool right so every night they take the cat back all right and then the next day they come in and if the gorilla learned its phrases it got to play with the kitten they use it as a motivational tool so the gorillas like vocabulary started going through the roof all right so to cut to the chase one night to take the cat home somehow the little kitten gets out it got hit by a car and it died yeah that cat you never met died i'm sorry for your loss i know you knew it all of it for  20 seconds you know i don't know if it was dead instantly like if it drove right over its head and that was it or maybe it just hit the back legs and it tried to crawl away but it was it was like stuck to the road and it was it was meowing out and it could see its breath and right before it lost consciousness the rats came in and it was it was just screaming and it's it's such a cute little paws it was like little socks trying to get it off i don't know what happened but you seemed so  concerned about this kitten i figured i threw out a couple of theories more concerned about the kitten than all the hitler  by the way more of a reaction overreact that's fine every crowd's a little bit different that's not the point of the story okay the point of the story was now this lady had to go down to the zoo she had to tell the gorilla that the kitten was dead right so she comes back down to the zoo and the gorilla's all amped up this is like its favorite part of the day and its mind is engaged and it sees its little friend and at this point it's vocabulary it's like crazy now the lady shows up the gorilla's all amped up and just looks just like oh  what's up yeah right now i can't do sign language so you're gonna have to bear with me through the rest of this bit i'm gonna do the best i can all right so the thing's like what's up yeah all right but the zookeeper lady she she has like you know just sitting there all sad you know trying to think how she's gonna tell it right and the gorilla picked up on the vibe all right she's kind of like hello all right nelson the gorilla's energy just comes all down she just starts looking at the lady like uh what's uh what's what's what's wrong with you is there something that i i need to know huh so the lady's sitting there she's like jesus well  well the the kitty cat it got hit by a car and it's  dead and the gorilla immediately took it in immediately took it in and understood like its bottom lip started quivering its eyes started watering up it was signing like crying and then going later on that night you could hear it crying inside of its house they built in a house i don't know why they live in trees it's probably the guilt to put the thing in the  jail right whatever it was like a two-bedroom it sounded like it was in the kitchen and you just hear this thing in this house at night just going  and that was the end of the video  that was the end of the video and like you i was sitting there like what the  you're gonna end on that and then literally right in that moment i felt my wife's head just rest on my shoulder she was like that was so sad i mean it was beautiful but it was sad and i was just like get off me so just get off me i closed the laptop set it down on the nightstand and i just got up and i started pacing it's this  rage was coming up in me my wife's like freaking out she's like what's wrong what is wrong with you and i'm just like what do you mean what's wrong that video is  up  what is the purpose of that you teach a gorilla how to talk you're shooting the  you get it a pet kitten and then it dies and then the gorilla cries and it's  sad and then that's it that's what you're leaving me with i gotta walk around with that in my  head  how is that the end of the video somebody for  sakes tell me dude that gorilla understood the concept of death if it understands the concept of death it understands its own captivity okay so it never dawned on that lady that whole time she's shooting the  with them and never dawned on her to sign to the thing like like hey like do you want to get get the  out of here do you hate it in here do you want to  kill us for sticking you in here away from your friends in the jungle and then they could be like yeah man please get me out i beg of you it  sucks in here right and then you could have brainstormed right like okay okay i'm gonna get you out of here and then the only bad part would be you'd have to deal with the grilling it's it's crazy  gorilla idea you know what i mean like brainstorming it's an escape plan the girl will be like okay we'll get a bunch of bananas we'll throw them and distract them and then we'll climb out just using our arms and then you literally just have to sit there like okay okay uh not not trying to be a dick but i have a better idea no no no no disrespect to you okay  but i'm gonna go to big and tall i'm gonna get a jacket a hat and some  up looking shoes okay and what i need from you what i need from you okay what i need for you is you you gotta lay off this  all right no more of this hey no no no no no disrespect okay i need you i need you to man up all right stand up straight arm down stand up straight here's the difficult part right here okay left hand right foot right hand left foot you got it bam bam all right you get that  down i'll get you out of here in in ten days cool it'll be okay good deal  all right see you in 10 days right it's like the first day the grill is sitting on my okay okay  no no no no no  okay yes   so that's the first thing that's day one but the gorilla keeps working at right like day two day two it's kind of getting day three day five day seven day nine day ten i'm doing it i'm  doing it then she could have came back and broke that gorilla out of jail right you show up at night look at you dude you  do it put on that jacket in the head come on you take him down to the car that's the only way to get it back you got to take it by car down to the harbor it's the only way to get it back to the jungle you can't go to the  airport right you can't go to the airport standing going through that  security right once he takes his shoes off and that thumb comes sticking out it's  over it's over you keep it below deck you keep the  thing below deck until you get out to international waters then you fight it's captain's law come on board right have the thing sit down other boats going by looking at you like is that a gorilla yeah what do you got blood diamonds go  yourself   sex ladies get out of here i'll have it come aboard and rip that mask right off then you're just hanging with the gorilla you get to have that experience of seeing the thing free for the first time this comes over the horizon it finally sees the jungle it's getting all excited it jumps off the boat it's rolling around in the sand you're like buddy we did it don't  up the code i got to bring it back we did it all right get out of here i love you too man i'm going to miss you get out of here before they see you right that thing runs right to the edge of the jungle and just disappears like it did do you want to go see his friends man you want to be free it's going to be  great he's going to go meet his buddies he's going to talk to his friends now like he should be right he's uh he's gotta go talk to his friends well probably teach them how to talk  and of course i'm gonna probably get horses did i just start planting to the  apes he's gonna teach his friends how to talk and get horses dude i gotta kill this  dick i gotta kill it i  up i gotta kill it sorry i got where's my block where the  is my block where is it where that's right here it was right there  you got a little sick shooter  it i'll take this and you run to the jungle but it's a gorilla so it's long gone but you can't give up man all the society is gonna go down on you you gotta kill this  thing so you just rush it through the jungle for months you get six seven months in you got like malaria you're about ready to give up and i don't know where that your buddy just jumps down boom just like oh  what the  are you doing here  you just pull out your sick shooter sorry buddy i gotta do it i think i'll be like but i i i thought we were french why i you know because because jesus wanted it that way you know it's this whole book he made us in his image which we're just you know but we're better than you you know sorry i can't have you talking to other  chimps and then you tear down the statue of liberty i just everyone's gonna think i'm an  look i'll make it quick right as you go to pull the trigger the gorilla pulls out that glock you couldn't find   i just i just want to know one thing how did you know you knew before i knew i don't have an ending for this  i don't in a weird way now you know how i felt when i watched that video  you know what it was you know what it was was i did that joke all around the country all right and the gorilla always died because jesus wanted it that way and that was it and it  bombed in every goddamn city in this country except for dallas texas it was the only place where they got it and i'm not  on texas it bonded houston austin el paso san antonio killed in dallas they're the only ones who got it they were just like hey man you did what you had to do you did what you had to do man i mean i love that gorilla too but god damn it you cannot have two species working together tell you right now you get a couple of gorillas on a bareback horse with a single-pole action rifle that is the end of society as we know it should get a hypothetical medal for killing that gorilla hypothetically so all right i'll i'm going to end with a quick little story here okay okay they're always talking about how to make a woman happy but i don't think they do it enough to help you guys out how to make a man happy right the great thing about men is we're  simple we're  simple okay so here's the thing right here you want to make a guy happy if you're with a good guy okay this is also all you got to do okay how about four times a year one's a thief you go out to the kitchen without him saying  you go out to the kitchen you make a sandwich you get him a beer you walk out you give it to him you don't say a word and you just  leave it's all you got to do every three months you do that you keep them happy that's all it takes now i know right out of the gate this is coming off sexist right it's because i'm saying go out the kitchen make your man a sandwich i'm not saying women belong in the kitchen barefoot pregnant rubbing my balls i'm not saying that okay i'm just saying women go in the kitchen just go in the kitchen four times in a year make a sandwich a toddler could do that put it together grab two slices of pre-made pre-sliced bread two handfuls of pre-murdered meat put a little mustard on it grab a beer walk out just hand it to him don't say  and then  leave and when i say leave i mean leaf i don't mean walk into another room for like 10 minutes and then stick your head back and just be like did you like it was it good great because downstairs we need you don't yell at me i just made you a sandwich i don't mean that i mean get in the car and  get out of here take the kids drive down the street go see lord of the rings a couple of times and leave your man in the stunned silence of what you just did do you ever want to see your guy get emotional you ever want to see a man get emotional you make him a  sandwich that he didn't ask for i'm telling you he's going to have to dry the tears with the bread he's gonna be so shocked like you made this for me i didn't even ask oh my god i think she still gets a   yeah quick story me and my wife bought a house in 2011 and by me and my wife i mean i paid for it right she hates that joke but i don't give a  it's true she's always breaking

whatever reason i'm drawn to this thing and i go down i open the door and the last people had to clean it out there was like a busted refrigerator an old file cabinet an ab roller something from a luau there was like seven failed businesses in this goddamn thing and i gotta start lugging this  out in like 90 degree weather as a redhead hating my life right i got three hours into this job my forearms were cut i had dirt sweat cobwebs all over me i wanted to burn down this  house i was ready to leave but out of nowhere my wife showed up big smile on her face and she'd made me a sandwich cut it in half diagonally which is love right they don't cut it in half they might as well frisbee there you're like yeah you got your  piece of  hose yourself off you should live out here you should live out here right cut in half diagonally poured fritos in the middle and gave me an ice cold beer she did that five years ago do you know to this day every once in a while i still think about that sandwich it's unbelievable it just pops in my head like this fond memory i'll just be like myself talking in the car remember that time she made me a sandwich it was unbelievable she cut it in half fritos with an ice-cold beer i felt like a king that's all it takes you know what it felt like at that moment if you remember that you remember that movie uh shawshank redemption you know that scene where the prisoners are drinking the beer on the rooftop with the sun in their face that's what it felt like the only thing missing was morgan freeman's voice narrating over the top and for 20 minutes bill burr felt like a free man all right i'm out of time you guys were so awesome thank you so much  i really had a great time thank you so much you

amen you know what those hats stand for for the abuse of Batman and I'm just looking at this  like you're wearing a viking outfit I don't know if you're familiar with Viking history but they were the first grab them by the  people for thousands of years we're grabbing  and we're so crazy we named the football team after them would never have a team called the colorado Cosby's you know that's I'm not gonna lie that'd be a fun game to announce though looks like another come from behind victory for the Cosby's this weekend it's like every time they catch him sleeping Jim do you notice this watching him sleeping it's good to see him spike in end zones not cocktails though I will say that's an improvement for The Cosby's so I'm looking at this Viking  and I'm just like should be hating her okay but I'm actually so jealous because I'm like I wish I could walk around that oblivious toward a complete hypocrite I am I know I'm a hypocrite I gotta deal with that  every day that's taxing Michael Jackson comes on and I gotta settle that debt I love the music but he touches toddlers right like we know he does it wait a minute does some of y'all think how many all think Michael Jackson did not touch those kids I'd rather you be honest we got another one okay okay I wish I wish I could be you every time Mike comes on you get to listen to King of Pop well I'm listening to the King of Pop and cherries you know  Lucky You Are  I have to be honest with my feelings okay here's the reality okay I feel like Michael Jackson touched those kids but I also feel like he didn't touch enough kids for me to stop listening to his music I do feel that way I do feel that way I'm not proud of that but that is the way I feel okay you could probably feed him 10 12 more and I'm Gonna Keep listening to that  every single time it comes off do you remember not at all keep on going Mike do your  thing okay I know I'm wrong to have these feelings by the way I've tried to change these feelings okay I watched that documentary about them snitching ass kids I lost him I did watch him I watch it okay I'm starting with the man in the mirror all right I'm trying to change his ways I watch them I watched them  crying the whole documentary  I was molested by my hero son of a  foreign bus driver not their hero your hero my hero growing up was Michael Jordan if Michael Jordan molested me I could walk it off probably in the freshest Jordans you've ever seen in your life hey bro where you get them shits me too over these dog don't even worry about they only got these and youth sizes homie but I said to myself I'm watching this documentary up until I find out what Mike did to those kids because once I find out what he did to the kids that's it I can't like him anymore I can't even listen to music anymore once I find out what he did to the kids and then I will move on I'm done like I got to the point and basically they said did Michael Jackson lick their  and what I found out about me is that's not enough a licked hassle that's cleaning can we be honest here that right there you got your ass cleaned by Michael Jackson that's a Billie Jean bade young grateful bastard that's your  licked by the greatest  liquor in history Michael Jackson literally shaved down his nose so he could get deeper in those boys ass es do you remember MJ by the time he died he looked like Voldemort okay just a flat-faced with three holes in it like a bowling ball just head banging boy booties foreign we have to put things in perspective a licked  from your hero if Michael Jordan if Michael Jeffrey Jordan took that glorious tongue of his you know the tongue  if he took that tongue and attacked my rim the way he attacked rims in the league grab my hips and shattered my backboard are you kidding me I'd be honored that's not even gay he's the goat that's bestiality I'm still proud of it that would be the crowning achievement of my childhood Michael Jordan licked my  played that night and dropped 39 points I'm the reason he had the flu  Pizza Mike yeah Pizza this ass why don't you be honest with the people okay we filmed it and everything we're calling it face Jam

killer  oh because the guy's hot Ted Bundy this is good that you said that I'm really glad you brought a Ted bunny because I asked my girl to play uh serial killer thing and we watched two together

killer that's a DUI Sweetheart give it a rest okay it's a recall on Broccoli three people Mother Teresa killed more than three people okay sit down next one she put on was Ted Bundy and he's the goat he's the girl he's the greatest serial killer of all time is undeniable and I'll tell you why it's not because he killed 50 women that's easy anybody could do that that's I could kill 50 women with a pair of Lululemon pants that's why it works hey they're giving out free Lulu's an alley I play whack a Megan for 30 minutes I got 50 bodies that's light that's life that's lie come on come on come on

do you manage  that's  up  just pops in our head and we can't say it do you ever have a thought so  up you're like damn bro I didn't even know I was capable of that  bro the other day my girl uh my girl said we needed to get an ottoman which like the most fiance thing to do we need we need to get an ottoman God forbid we sit on the couch with our feet on the ground like peasants God forbid right we need an ottoman so when I wake up to piss in the night I have someone to slam my shins into we need the ottom so we're at Graham Barrel right I'm just wandering around I look over my left shoulder I see this Middle Eastern dude standing on this carpet now foreign thing I just looked over and went that's the best I could do that's knee jerk that's a reflex I see a middle eastern dude on a carpet I'm gonna chuckle dude I'm sorry I gave it and I shut it down real quick okay because that guy is there just so he could furnish his apartment it doesn't matter and I think he's about to take off on that  thing okay I was 100 certain at one point in time he bends over to check the price and curls the front of the carpet I was like oh he is out of here foreign he went under the hood it's about to be fast and furious Arabian Nights In This  he is gone but I didn't say anything I kept it in here okay because it's not life or death okay if it's not a life or death situation you keep that  in here now don't get me wrong if we're on the edge of a cliff and it's me a carpet in the Middle Eastern dude then a pack of hyenas is closing in on us there might be some words exchanged okay I'm not gonna be too direct about it I'll probably be like what do you think we should do to get out of this predicament Middle Eastern guy next to the carpet he's looking at me like the  you want me to do it's a whole pack of hyenas I'm like  there's a whole new world if we just get on this goddamn carpet and go to safety show me the world okay you've seen the movie too it's a two-seater we can film this  show me the goddamn world life or death you could say it okay life or death your prejudices start to come out I'm not even talking about racial either you know what I mean like for I won't have a doctor with an underbite that's a Prejudice I got not gonna happen I don't care if there's no correlation between the two you're not gonna walk into my surgery like okay what are we fixing today how about your jaw you  Bulldog how dare you I'm gonna walk into my surgery looking like a cash register cha-ching let's put that thing back where it's supposed to be should we walk outside collect some rain water  how dare you how dare you  that's all I'm trying to say sometimes life or death makes even the most offensive situation tolerable okay even racist situations like for example blackface is wrong races cannot do it we agree we agree okay good blackface is wrong can't do it good can I do it blackface is wrong well I have to ask the Black Faces I can't ask the  wrestle y'all your opinions don't matter it's up to them they make the rules lagface is wrong it's racist you cannot do it okay under no circumstances cannot do it then you see them Navy Seals commercials you're like all right well kind of sometimes you could do it right the whole Navy Seals commercial is like look how cool black face is on a helicopter look how cool blackface is on a boat backface in the water they can swim I don't know if they say that I don't know if they say that I that I might have added that part I might add it that part that's on me but I'm just saying life or death situation has changed the stakes let's say for example me and you were going on a mission to save America from high gas prices when gas like a dollar fifty America is very Progressive right we're like you have to respect all the cultures of the world guys because of five dollars were like yo they might need some democracy out there in the Middle East body see this five dollars how to make women dress like that we guess it's five dollars about it they just throwing gay people on buildings when gas is five dollars liberate those people so let's say for example you and I are going on a mission save America the mission takes place at 1am that is an important piece of the information on the call sheet you have your complexion I have the complexion of an iPhone flashlight if you don't give me blackface we're  dead I'm a disco ball in the desert they're going to see us from a mile away it's head shots for the both of us you want to see her again you've got to paint me the  up bro full thing you don't have to do the lips and the tap shoes that's a little bit much but you you  up if you want to survive you're not going to let me go on that mission with you without putting on blackface for your safety just like I'm Not Gonna Let You Smile there's certain things guys there's certain things that we have to do so we get home those beautiful white teeth lighten up the night I can't take that risk I can see white people in the crowd looking for black people to see if it's okay to laugh at this joke and the fact that you're having trouble finding them is exactly the point that I'm trying to make okay it's about privilege all right I understand I have white privilege okay but you have night privilege and we need to bring those together foreign don't get me wrong we get pulled over on a ride home that's where I take care of business  they're a problem speeding must have been my Blackfoot I'll take care of it is it  up yeah I guess it is is that your girlfriend right there how long you guys been together

basically like uh this birth control USB the girls inserting their  and they just leave it there they just stuff it in there and leave it there and then they just hope they don't  a black guy to knock

15th kid he got a vasectomy now I don't know if you guys know what a vasectomy is basically they cut the Vaz deference that's the highway from your balls to your penis hole right and it takes a sperm for balls but they just cut that  and Antonio I'm already had two more kids after the vasectomy that's how athletic that  was bro his sperm win there like Mario Kart Rainbow Road just hopping over to

didn't talk about uh how they're taking away your scoop Scoops ladies  you're not  up they trying to take away your scoop scoops it's unbelievable I just want to let you all know right now ladies uh I am with you I think it's your body your choice I agree with you on that 100. I agree with you when you say that men should have no say in the decisions you make with your bodies those are your decisions to make and yours alone and I feel that way because at the end of the day when we all go up to heaven and God's like why are we all killing babies we're gonna be like y'all  I think they're very clear whose decision this was God uh looks like you need to pay for your sins babe even though I paid for your sins come on y'all chivalry ain't dead to that baby as you know the rules  oh man yeah abortion abortion abortion abortion man it's a tricky one when I was living uh in my old place in New York I lived down the block from an abortion clinic and uh location location and Nobles what was this New York like it's a  Carnival outside of there every single day like people New York and they go to like Broadway plays and  they'll literally spend thousands of dollars to watch Harry Potter the musical when they could just stand outside the clinic and watch something really disappear fetus the leaders  I remember one time I was walking by the clinic and I saw a father and his daughter outside and his daughter looked like she was 10 years old now I don't want to divide the crowd politically here uh but for me that's a little late this is just me I'm not putting my views on you personally I think a fetus becomes a life around the third grade that that's I think that's a life I do believe that's a life okay maybe we could roll it back a few years from there but definitely if you could spell abortion we don't abort you that's just the rule that I have in my book okay so naturally I'm like yo I gotta save this girl's life I'll walk over I get a little closer it turns out he wasn't aborting his daughter thank God uh what he was actually doing was protesting the abortion clinic and I never seen this  before in real life it was crazy like he's like heckling these girls as they go in you know he's just screaming at that you're gonna burn in hell and these girls are so New York about they're like I just have chlamydia your  burning hell I'm burning now that's why I'm going to the  Clinic  so I'm watching this go down and I'm torn right because naturally as a man I want to protect these women right but as a comic I love a rose right so like how do I fit in this  and then all of a sudden this UPS employee walks into the clinic and I had to I had to at least someone wants to deliver it was the right thing to say guys he got in on it he was like same day it was unbelievable probably chemistry was there chemistry was there so I'm standing outside of clinic right next to this dude who's like very passionate about abortion I realized I've never spoken one of these guys before so I'm like I just got to talk to him so I went up to him and I was like hey man I don't want to interrupt your whole take your daughter to work day I think I think it's great you want to spend time with your family obviously not everybody here gets that I just gotta know why are you so against abortion and the guy looks at me he goes I'll tell you what change it all for me it's these new sonograms thank God a few of you guys said what we're idiots I didn't even know they upgraded the sonographs it completely to sonograms it's not like the uh back in the day they'll pay your cable remember those remember the black paper with the gray clouds on it those were portable let's just be honest right like Dr hands you that  like an action sketch you're like we'll see you later kiddo but the new ones are HD 4D not 3D 4D you could hear the baby like gave me I'm in here what are you doing out there that's not where you hang a shirt  so I'm looking at these images right and I'm like man this is visceral this is hard to it's hard to disagree with and then I noticed all the images he's showing me are from much later on in the pregnancy so I was like hold up hold up what about early on he goes I don't care he's killing a baby I'm like but bro it's not even a baby yet he goes yeah but if you leave it there it's gonna grow into a baby so it's a baby and I was like you know what your daughter's  hot bro this guy loses his  mind the  you mean my daughter's actually 10 years old what the hell is wrong with you I'm like yeah but if we leave her there foreign to a woman pops are we pedophile's a pro-life you decide now that right there was a seamless transition into an ad if I've ever seen one before Flawless Perfection and you deserve it but so does betonline.ag the greatest gambling platform on the planet gamble on whatever sport you want they

lot sweetheart like what like what really I went to one of them women's marches and we had a lot in common I saw those girls screaming Free the nipple that sounds pretty good right they're screaming we should be able to have sex with as many guys as we want yes you should if we get pregnant we should be able to abort it hopefully and we need to work so we can pay our half Hallelujah let's get down here happening we've reached Common Grounds it was unbelievable these women were fighting for the right to become the men they've always hated just walking around with their shirts off  whoever not worried about the kid I'm like are y'all feminists or  boys what is this   sand we're on the same team you know what I mean and that's good because this is as good as it gets ladies y'all can't move anywhere else and it gets better for y'all that's a fact we are  sexist we say stupid  like women can't drive women can't drive me but in the Middle East they're like no seriously women can't drive so we don't play that  out here are there women driving ah man give me the  Stones these  out here driving gotta teach them a lesson with stones thank you I'm not saying there aren't things that y'all got to go through obviously you know like you you might have a daughter that has low self-esteem because she's comparing herself to these unrealistic images every single day and that's really  up um but but in China you can't have a daughter so yeah you have a daughter they just mash it into an iPhone that's the policy enjoy your face time enjoy your face time there's a little Chinese girl inside every one of your iPhones why do you think when your phone breaks they say put in a bag of rice you think that's a coincidence you think that's a coincidence it's to soak up her tears okay have some respect we love y'all okay and we want to make you happy I think most guys want to make you especially sexually there's this rumor like we don't care about satisfying you that's not true at all we feel pathetic if we don't satisfy you that  is just mad difficult we're gonna keep it a buck It's Tricky yo Clint I don't know exactly where it is I still do Ash Wednesday every time I'm down there dog right like longitude latitude you bump into it father son Holy Ghost father son Holy Ghost without enough times you get baptized   are tricky nobody ever stared down the barrel of a  it was like that's how I would have designed it just like that two lips why stop it two four Double Down double down on two always add a hood I want that  looking emo I want that  looking like a school shooter because once a month it's a massacre down there  there's a lot of things you ladies have harder in life but satisfying the opposite sex is not one of them let's be honest it's easy to make a dude come you agree right that's not an accomplishment it is easy we have pre-cum that means before we come we come we're never not coming we turned 13 just leak for the rest of our lives you don't ever have to ask us ladies like sometimes girls are like did you come already four hours ago sweetheart that's my knee at dinner sperm are like  shootout it just climbs to the top and then chills there like it's in a Jacuzzi at a ski resort foreign  bro it looks  freezing out there it's just easy it has to be easier I'll be honest I I never suck dick but I could do it I know that I could do it it's positive feedback built into the dick okay you sucking a dick good hard sucking a dick bad shoelace you could be the best at eating  in the world or diversity and  in the world  still stares at you like Stephen Hawking  just motionless drooling  if someone kidnapped my mom and they were like yo Schultz we're gonna kill your mom unless you either make Ted come or Rebecca come on thank you  Becca why don't you grab us some seltzers or something okay Ted and I got a life to save never tennis light work okay I go in there he's like listen when I like shut the  up Ted sit down get your dick sucked like a man I go into Rebecca we are rolling the dice I'm down there I'm giving it everything he's up there like I feel like you're just doing this to save your mom like  so it's easier we can all acknowledge that but that doesn't mean we don't we don't make you come and we feel pathetic if we don't make you come and here's the most  up part of it all we never know if you actually do come right there's no sign it's not like your titties light up or nothing there's nothing right the closest we have is sometimes during sex you'll be looking all beautiful and then out of nowhere you just go I don't know what the  that  is but it turned into big Edge from 90 Day Fiance out of nowhere you just yeah I'm trying to stuff as much dick in you as I possibly can I squeeze my butt cheeks I pump and squeeze I think I got an extra centimeter dick in my butt cheeks ain't gonna lie I squeezed my butt cheeks I might pop your head right out your  shoulders  around me when I squeeze my butt cheeks  we just want validation too okay and since we never know if you orgasm we got to settle for the side effects of sex all right that's why we're into the weird  you queef we get excited okay that same exact sound comes out of your butthole repulsed for 48 hours how could you destroy the fabric of our relationship by farting in front of me like that that's disgusting that sound comes out of your  after sex I got my hand to my ear like Hulk Hogan like let her rip baby I'm waiting for it when my girl gets off the bed after sex I'm waiting for that propeller to start spinning snaps and just oh

want to point that out liars all of them  liars I'm supposed to believe four thousand years ago you guys built the pyramids right and then for the next four thousand years you built jack  not happening you built the greatest thing ever created by human beings four thousand years ago and then for the next four thousand years the best thing that you can create is cotton sheets  you I'm not a stupid person I'm not gonna believe some  lie like that okay I do some more research turns out they didn't even build their own pyramids do you know what they say build the pyramids who are they saying that they say that the Jews built the pyramids um look I think they got the contract I don't know if they put all the blocks on top of each other you know I think they hired some Mexicans you're Mexican yeah you guys probably did it you know that's for real that's why that's why people are always like the aliens built the pyramids it's like yes illegal aliens it's the wrong aliens you know you wanna know some fucked-up  though are there pyramids in Mexico beautiful pyramids right gorgeous pyramids in Mexico nobody questions who built those there is no our long history Channel special who build the pyramids and Mexicans  Africa there was a kitchen here and I need a tent shut up my Saturday Hayley's probably came with it we got it we got it don't worry you gonna help the Jews they struggling in the desert excellent work ethic it's impressive this is how this is how amazing Mexicans are at work they're the only people whose work ethic is a threat never hear people talk about makes things like that the Mexicans are stealing the jobs they're stealing the job how the  do you steal a job I never seen a Mexican walk into a restaurant give me the Edition no no we don't want the money Robert get off Sonny rap I wish they would steal the job every time I go in the Apple store I swear to God I wish for Team X's would just raid that  the Genius Bar is ours just nerds crying max if we can sell oranges we can sell this horrible I live with three first time I started living with women was three women right I'm excited because I'm like a  perv obviously I'm going like six cities this is gonna be great it's gonna be  titties everywhere that's what that is no it's hair everywhere it's like three five foot cats that's what's hot it'll tell you that that they shed their  hair I couldn't take a shower they'll pull it a  Roden out of the drain every single work did a possum die what the  happened what happened what happened in the dream it's hair everywhere no toilet paper that's another thing are you guys living together yet not yet okay we'll keep get ready get ready for the most toilet paper you've ever seen you internalize the reason why we don't have rain for us is because of how women white that's how I just wanted you know nobody teaches women how to wipe properly it's this is how your dad teaches you fold it over four or five six times wipe your ass someone in history told women oh we need a wipe just wrap your body like a mummy just wrap your  hand to your shoulder blade okay and then just one time throw it off like an oven mitt  off me I would not be surprised if you just stick your hand in the middle the toilet paper roll and just dab in a circle bro no there was never  toilet paper I wipe my ass with a maxi pad once that's a real thing I took a maxi pad to my ass and I wiped with it you want to know something incredible please best wife I ever  had it I'm clean today from that way I'm sitting on the toilet I look over you know there's no toilet paper it's just a cardboard and you know when you have that moment with the cardboard we're like waited a little I could create a toilet paper like substance of this cardboard I stopped myself I'm an American I'm not what there's no  car so I start looking for things away with I find some tampons on my ass a little invasive not find these maxi pads right and all right so so I open up the maxi pad the maxi pad is like this big right like how the  am I gonna hold this and wait at the same time right and then I found out what every woman in this room already knows the back is sticky I was back in business stuck it on my palm dug the   out of here from 17 years ago like what dunkaroos get the  a good joke is very similar to like a relationship you're with this chick and like you guys are banging in the beginning if you like that I would compare it to basketball eventually you're like banging but it's not as exciting as when you were banging up in a beginning if the hoop changed every single time if you can get them tied into your emotional and sub avatar ship and it's like a penguin every square is a rectangle but not every rectangles are square when the avatars would like tie their blades together and then eventually it's like  and white and poop well I don't know which one the seller is I know the sellers the rectangular square I don't know that much about geometry but after a while you put it in a rest if you can get an audience to tie them braids into your emotion that's how you get the feel  here's something we do a lot of you probably didn't even know what we do because we'd love you once you feel beautiful it's during sex during lovemaking if you will because we want you to feel beautiful is we make noise we don't have to do that we've been

it's a tuesday we're gonna roll in today how old are you guys  let me ask you a question how is jeffrey epstein's island  how old are you 18. you're aged out  hey look at you on that island like what this old  doing over here get her ass out of here you got your period  outta here guys can i tell you guys a story okay last night i'm doing a show here okay and i was talking about the abstain thing and two people a couple just get up and they  leave just trying to come up with an epstein joke right because how do you justify what he's doing it's  horrible right so i'm just talking about it last night on stage i'm just bringing it up i know it's bad okay but i'm just throwing ideas out there just throwing them out just jokes you know i'm like the reason why he had the young girls on the island is because in case they tried to swim away he would just play baby shark daddy just kidding they don't have dads look that that's why they were on the island guys i'm just searching for jokes here i know it's  up sir okay you look like you've been you look like the contractor that built that island  listen if you want a good dungeon what you got to do let's say let me tell you something let me tell you you want a dungeon i'll teach you how to make a dungeon let's see oh you got a good oak you go 20 feet under the ground plaster it all up okay the girl screams can't get through the plaster look i'm just throwing the idea it doesn't matter the couple gets up and they  run out they run the  out and i stop and instead of making fun of anything i was like listen they did the exact right thing they did the exact right thing they felt uncomfortable they felt you know wildly miserable and they were in an awful situation and then they just got up and left right now the tricky thing about being on an island  you won't be here for a while you show love through love we don't do that we show love through sacrifice so a lot of times we'll be loving you and you don't even know for example right we're sitting on the couch at home cuddled up chilling watching movies you got your leg on top of my leg i don't want your leg there at no point in time during this movie am i going baby you know make this better if i had no feeling from the hip down that would really improve my movie-watching situation if i had like one leg with blood in it right and then one lieutenant dan that would be perfect now i want to ask you to take your leg off my leg but you can't you got a girl you there's no way you don't ask that and then it goes well right no matter how nice you say it oh baby you know your legs are made of clouds uh just let me get that out there ah amazing and not even the cumulonimbus ones like the thin ones like the little you don't even know is that a cloud like what is it right it's like i was just wondering if you could take your little cloud thigh and um give me some sunshine you can say that but all she hears is get your fat  dinosaur thigh off of me you beast holy  are you a centaur is that what you are because you look like a human but your legs feel like a  horse holy  seabiscuit what the  your legs should be hanging in a spanish restaurant where they shave ham off of it that's what your legs are you're made out of jamon serrano that's what you are so instead we just sit there let you crush our leg you ever wonder why every old man is a i think there's a cane  no women play tennis until they're 95 years old i've never even seen a woman with a cane a guy hits 52 he's hobbling down the street like he just got in a motorcycle accident why because he loved his wife what did she do in return treat him like a futon for 20 years sacrifice love you you do a lot of  so you feel good you don't even realize did you know that we're very selfless individuals for real here's something we do a lot of you probably didn't even know what we do because we love you we want you to feel beautiful it's during sex during love making if you will because we want you to feel beautiful is we make noise we don't have to do that we've been jerking off in our parents house since we're 12 years old like a ninja when we're jerking off alone when i go  i got me slow down andrew slow down i jerk off like a serial killer  they want us to stop using anti-animal language horrible things like killing two birds with one stone you gotta stop using that term because animals they understand it and boy are they furious when they're here i mean there's a reason those birds  on us and  definitely they heard us saying killed two birds who won't stop definitely the root definitely the root of the problem why are we worried about wasting stones  i'm not gonna lie if i killed two birds with a thousand stones i'd be so  impressed are you kidding me like dude it only took me a thousand stones i killed two bald eagles that's insane you see that they were just flying done on the ground stuff it put it on a wall i'm american let me tell you uh how little i care about animal rights especially bird rights this morning i had a chicken omelet  is it possible to dominate a species more than to eat the mother and child  on the same  meal i didn't even do breakfast then lunch same meal the whole family two generations of poultry wiped off the face of the universe i killed two birds with zero stones  ryan i mean brilliant 5 000 years man we were

Norm Macdonald,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyLbHT0SJAE,Mr Norm Macdonald you're all right okay you're all right you're all right Hey listen man uh  hey how you doing guys  I like being here I like uh playing casinos because uh I'm a degenerate Gambler and uh they know it yeah get paid off in chips a lot here you can tell sometimes just one big chip that's really insulting  there are casinos where you know what I like is Casino you know because there's the Vegas then there's the casinos like this and then there's Indian casinos which I like the best because I feel like I'm doing some reparations you know for a methodically murdering their uh forefathers which lock it back was way out of line way out of line but uh I pretty well done my share of handbag I'll tell you that I got no kills I  played my I paid some of you guys this so uh  I was in Vegas that's why I'm in Vegas and now I'm here and uh Hollywood oh everybody thinks they're fooling about it  I was down to two choices Phil is going with Columbus Bob is going with Hollywood all right plus I live in L.A Hollywood is a piece of piece of like I didn't realize till I moved to Hollywood it's like a fake place like you know because you I thought the Beverly hillbill isn't I thought everything was like that but have you ever been to Hollywood it's  horrible like there's the stars on the ground but you don't know any of them they're from radio and and then people are pissing on them like that's not a way to you know make Bob Hope's family feel good hahaha all right when you go to a casino because when I was in Vegas now here people will sometimes come and they'll have a system you know what I mean they'll have a system they're going to break the bank you know what I mean they're going to beat the casinos and sometimes these systems actually do not work and this is what I saw it was a couple months ago but let's pretend it's today I was on the elevator today how's it going and a month later I figured out a joke anyways I got on the elevator and this is what I heard it was just all there was was a man and his wife on the elevator and I got on so it's just us three intention there was a lot of tension So This Is Us four and we we're going down and it's getting more and more tense and suddenly the guy out of the blue he goes he says to his wife he goes I don't give a what I said give me the money like that so I think I think I was witnessing like the unraveling of a system of some sort like that this fella was calling an audible you see  Vegas has a very weird odd slogan you know what I mean like uh like uh you don't have to see that story like uh Atlanta Georgia hey you like Peaches I don't know what they are but I should I should have done some research on this but you know what I'm talking about Virginia for people who like to lay down on ladies or whatever you know you've heard Columbus we're actually Hollywood I don't know anything but uh Vegas has this one that's so shady it says whatever happens in Vegas stays in Vegas you know which is like good God you know you might as well just have a gag or like  we're kind of a shady and also it's not true it's not like you can just kill someone and leave you know they'll follow you they'll hunt you down bring you back I'll try you know Furniture of your peers sniffling a lot tonight and makes me paranoid when I sniffle because I think you guys will think I'm on cocaine I'm also I am on a lot of cocaine and so that makes me paranoid as well so the combination of being on cocaine and being worried you guys think I am on cocaine even though I'm not hell of an attack area anyways my point is this is this is Las Vegas hey whatever happens in Vegas stays in Vegas so I I thought about it I started ruminating on it trying to figure out what it meant I started night after night not being able to sleep trying to figure out the slogan then I finally figured it out all it really means is you can go to Las Vegas have sex with a prostitutes and The Prostitute will not tell your wife back home yeah they're very discreet that big time Las Vegas prostitutes you know they're not like the  gossipy small town a horse you know that  those blabber Mouse don't know where to keep their mouth shut you know and the beauty parlor you're Alex majerison's wife well my God small world I took a last night I took a out of his chest laughs in exchange for cash it's a small world where is your small world isn't that a weird thing small world I don't believe that the world's small it seems very large to me like like this seems large and compared to the world this is I don't wanna I don't wanna I don't mean to insult you or anything like that but you're all you're much smaller than the world that's all I'm saying  but you know the way people use that term let's say you go to Paris France you know you go you're watching you're looking at the arch Triumph I should have started with a French the Arch of Triumph is it you've got Arts to Triumph and you're watching it and uh there's a fella standing next to you and you go hey uh uh I'm from Columbus Ohio and the other guy goes I'm from Columbus Ohio too you go small world small world you know and I don't I think that happens very rarely though so I don't believe that it's a small world I think I think most of the conversations in front of the arch to Triumph go like this go like hey I'm from Columbus in Ohio where are you from I'm from Paris France well it's a big world I'll tell you that God damn there's a giant globe hardly nobody knows anybody  yeah it was a thing I realize about gambling very rational is what I heard myself say that uh again we can pretend it's today but I am at what that has happened uh I'm at a roulette I walked this is how a rational you are when you're gambling and and I heard myself say this I go to the crab the roulette table rather I put a hundred dollars down on black it spins around and it lands on red and then I say I almost picked ass very rational and the entire table understood that was also they were like wow yeah you can't second guess yourself on that you know if you understand anything about the game of roulette  took an airplane from Las Vegas Nevada I get scared of those  even though you know I probably get killed on an airplane but you know what I do I get the uh the row the X called the exit row you know what I mean uh it should be called please God not the exit wrong but it's called the exit realm and uh it's good because you get a a about a foot extra um latent and all you have to do to get the extra uh leg room all you have to do to sit in the exit row is to lie  what happens is the steward desk comes up to you and she's flight attendant  she comes after a lot of new words all right okay  I come from a different time usually people say that from the future but I'm saying it from the past I come to you from a different time with Stewart has this I come to you from a time when if you were a lady and you were a flight attendant we would call you a stewardess and if you're a gentleman and you're a flight attendant we would call you well it doesn't matter now a steward a steward  who are you guys thinking I think I'm outraged now I'm outraged or what you guys thought in your brains I don't believe they're gonna Huff I got the new Huff have you tried it the Chrysler Huff they're gonna be leaving in it soon I can't be you know what you know I don't know how anyone can be outraged by anything like I could see it way back in the old days but nowadays what what the  like how how to be uh outraged by watching some guy on stage saying something you know I've seen internet pornography  once you've seen this  Anthony jeselnick is not going to make it I mean this by the way if you've never seen pornography on the internet don't  because it's going to change you  fundamentally and you're never going to get be able to come back it takes years and years God the first time ever as I came on late to it but probably for the first time about six years ago but people have been watching along before that and I thought in my stupid head that it was just a picture like you know sometimes a guy would show me a picture from the internet of it'd be like a lady with a horse but I just but the picture was just put together right like Photoshop I thought that's what stupidly I thought that's what internet porn was anyways six years ago I see actual internet porn and for the first I uh astounded first of all by the number of ladies like I go what God's like it's like one of 36 of 3 million 400 billion you're like is every woman a poor or something what happened like and the things they're doing I'm like holy Lord no lady has ever done anything to me anywhere close to this  and I was on the TV I go how can this be possibly happening  but then you change what happens is you become desensitized you remember that word oh yeah they like to use it in big bucks make you sleepy but what it means is it's not enough for you need more you need more like any addiction you know like after a few months of that internet Point you're like ah she can only take eight of her ass why'd you get in the business and you're gonna prude actually I'll find another thing I'll find a worse thing a person can do to another person I need it I tell you thank you I gotta get out of that I don't know what the poor children are doing you know what I mean when I was young we had like uh Playboy whatever I remember my dad saying when I was young all I needed was to see like a lot of Turner's uh ankle walking down the stairs which I also that was weird  yeah  I don't want to get you know but I saw a thing you know people should tell you what they're showing you on the internet before they show you you know what I'm saying let's go here you go Ah that's the worst thing ever why did you show me this so anyways guy showed me a picture of a lady making sweet love to a a pig a pig like a an actual pig farm you know barnyard animal pig you're all familiar with a pig I don't have to put to find a point I don't want to keep saying Pig do I know so I felt so guided when I was I felt sorry for the lady I felt sorry for the I felt sort of the pig you know I know a lot of people would feel sorry for the pig but you gotta figure you know you gotta think of the pig life like the pig's in a sky with a bunch of  other gross ugly fat pigs and they had sex and then one day they take them and they were a beautiful lady you know and he he's like holy Lord I never knew it could be like this you know and then the next day they throw it back in the sky is like ah you're on a bunch of fat pigs I didn't know before  to take the pig from the farm and onto a porno shooting but you can't take the porno shoot from the pig and give it back to the farm I think we all know that thing foreign by the way is that a related note I am on the same I am on the same dose of Viagra that they give to the donkeys in Mexico for the second show  oh my God how much yeah I don't have sex I retired from that a long time ago and uh I didn't do that good you know looking back because I was on the TV and and I didn't get much from being uh celebrity like you know like that lady took her kid got her into her I didn't I didn't know you could do that like my kid is is like a you know he's not that smart so I've been in a school and that's a fortune thank you so I don't think I use my celebrity or like grab a Girl by the I don't know you could do that now as a trump said that you could do that but that's not been my experience  they'll laugh and Go sir all right of course I've never done that and I wouldn't even know how to do it because if you think of the physiography  weren't I was pretty sure I'd get through life without ever saying if you look at that you know that that verdict you can't grab you know what I mean I don't know how you would just ran like I know how you would grab a guy's beautiful and shine like that  we listen we got a little dirty and uh I blame myself is there big is an important year I'm out here to talk about   I'm here to talk about importance of hey there's an election elect's big election going on and uh this is always a tough time for me because I don't know a lot of stuff and I don't have many opinions you know I come from a different time when I was young we didn't have no opinions like we had something like you know six I think  sometimes when you see a guy have eight opinions go God damn that fucker's opinion is I was seventh and eighth opinion but yeah we had about six opinions but most of them were about food to tell you the truth  alive it was like blueberry what are you  and also they think that because you're a comedian that you have an opinion that you're for some time a while ago I don't know when they decided that comedians were smart and uh I don't want to disillusion you but uh no not at all I'm not smart in anyone see we used to know that like in the old day like 30 years ago nobody would be going hey Red Skelton what do you feel about Vietnam that'd be but then something happened oh the the comedian you know I never I've read one place I said the comedian is the modern day philosopher and the first thing I love is I wonder how the actual modern day philosophers feel about them yeah that's toiling away in obscurity you know what do you got there Phil who the is Bill Omar by the way I keep talking he has to come up with one single important I wish I knew a full of Phil wasafi I know it's not pronounced philosophy in your country when I say I don't know anything by the way I or I don't have opinions I do but uh you know they're ones that everybody has you know what I'm saying like I know yellow is the best color like stuff like that where everybody agrees you know what I mean but when it comes these very hard questions you know I know and I don't know and you know what I don't feel so bad because sometimes I'll watch a news program and they'll ask a question it'll be a hard one you know they'll say like do you believe that the NAFTA will uh will hurt uh the gross national product of uh Malaysia yes or no and then they say at the end we'll be showing you the results and then sure to their word at the end of the news program they show you the results of the poll in a pie chart and you start thinking about pie God damn I wish this question is about  Puck and it's always like 45 yes 45 no and that's 10 one slice of the pie you know not very big but big enough I don't know and so then when I heard about you know then I go well that's a lot of people 10 you know 10 of uh you know this uh greatest possible country and the best of all possible worlds uh I'll take that you know that's 30 40 million people I won't be ashamed to be one of them I don't know and I will answer those if I anytime I see a one of those polls on CNN or when I was sure I'm a sucker for it man I always phone him up I go yes I have uh I wanna is this the TV yes and I wanted to answer because you had a question yes I I don't know the answer no that's my answer I don't know  I better show up on that pie chart I'm no set they're not dealing with a sap all right I'll keep my voice down people are trying to figure out how Trump won you know last night because uh you know they're wondering how they can beat them this time and uh everybody has theories they're written books on and everything I have my own Theory but I'm a simple man you know with simple thoughts yeah so maybe this is a little simple I've never heard anybody else say this and it seems kind of obvious to me I think the reason that Trump won the presidency of the United States is because he was the only guy running  oh  the lady was running also pick the perfect time for that little  experiment couldn't have worked out better  wait a little time to be stylish I had to go right  and Vic Hillary Clinton as a matter of fact she even wrote a book you know and uh you know you know I say you can't uh judge a book by its cover I disagree I believe you can read a book by its cover I've read many many books and uh for instance that book you can read by its cover I'll tell you the cover is only five words is all you need to know it says uh what happened Hillary Rodham Clinton so here's more self-aware than any of us knew but I really believe that I think the American people and I can see it from outside because I'm from Canada I think the American people said listen Hillary here's the deal we hate your guts God damn we hate you  I'll tell you how much we hate you who's gonna blow your mind  we hate you so much that we are gonna vote for a guy we hate more than you what do you think of that Mr revenant  they have ads now you know they'll show you ads but they're for people you know because if you're already deciding who you want to vote for now you're you're very acute uh I don't know if that's the word but you know pretend it is you're very you know politically acute it actually might be the right word so uh you know so they're trying to go out you you're smart so you'll see the commercials now I've seen them they're smart you know so like a guy I'll come on TV or a lady  and the guy will say listen if you want to hear my proposals about the the reform of the prison system that's necessary if you want to hear my ideas about uh children coming out of college a half a million in debt and how we fix that you want to hear my opinions on how we fix a broken Medical Care System then go on my website and you can read my position paper on it it's 45 pages and I go oh no  I won't be reading that  nothing against you there a partner you're uh seems like a nice enough gent but here's the thing the reason I'm going to tell you the reason I won't be reading your 45 page thing it's on a counter earlier today my friend was telling me that uh I only get the one life  I still have a half a box of Matlock DVDs can't do everything you know  if anything is that when they when they get down to it you know I heard this I heard this uh psychology you know psychology psychology yeah yeah sorry I'm I know you've heard it you guys ever heard the word psychology so I read this thing that they said that when it comes to picking presidents you know how in Psychology you have two brains you have your brain up here and then you have another brain back here the subconsciousness yeah your Consciousness so so the Consciousness that's what you use to buy Camp chocula you know the easy stuff subconscious is that you don't even know what you're thinking it doesn't tell your conscious brain anyway whatever but what they said was that when people pick the president United States what they what they go by is they pick the guy that they would rather have a beer with that huh and what's even hotter is that no politician that I've ever known has ever used that you know a very potent weapon like if it was me that would be the spine of my campaign like like I everywhere I go I have a glass of beer in my hand you know and then like my slogan would be like uh I do commercials I go ah you like beer should go to the White House and drink some with me God damn there's something I like about that guy I don't drink myself you know personally does that make me better than you I don't know what makes me better than you that's probably one of the things  now here listen this I don't do drugs and I don't drink but is that really true is that really true because check this dig this cats I smoke cigarettes right she goes so what that's not a drug really because nicotine's a drug you're like no it's not I'm like yeah it is or there's a Red Bull I drink Red Bull got caffeine in it you go yeah so what caffeine is not drug really because it is a truck so maybe I'm not better than most of you I do LSD you guys are you're like that's not a drug am I really that's not a drug really because it bends your mind I'm sorry I think you guys are when it comes but before every show to relax I take 10 or 20 uh hits of LST just a just a handful and I swallow up they had me go to a psychiatrist for it but God damn what a broken record this  was the whole half hour is like you gotta stop taking fistfuls of LSD before every show I'm like  I love how this guy is the expert on hallucinogenic drugs you know when I'm the guy that's taking a fistful of LSD but this guy I'm supposed to and you wouldn't believe this character man first of all he's a 14 foot blue dog with a big green look like a regular psychiatrist but he knows that uh he's an expert an academy studied all those melting books that uh behind them don't get me started foreign  don't get me started too late for me to have a catchphrase at this point hey there's that guy that always says don't get me started just for the last little while now but don't get me started I Come From Another Place another time another place as well foreign on a piece of paper and then I glued it where I taped it to this chair but I don't understand hardly any of them I have very bad hand right and one thing but here's the thing here's what happened this is a thing about getting old I wrote down this I'm reading this as I big fluffy dog that's what I wrote down right so I don't know what the that means but I remember it happening I remember thinking up a joke I remember because I took my dog to a diaper there's a big fluffy dog right and then my dog went to big floppy dog and then he did something that I can't remember but it was super funny and it was also was like the so Universal like everybody's been through it and then I write you know big fluffy dog  I started out doing stand-up we get so stoned and drunk every night and then we tell each other jokes after the show go hey what about this when your luggage comes out carousel funniest thing I ever heard so of course it's funny I would do that in my nightclub act yeah and then the next day we wake up we could black out drunks remember a thing and so I had an idea I said what I'm going to do is I'm gonna this was way before you know the teensy weensy tape recorders and all that that we have nowadays I said I'll get a little notebook and if I think of anything funny if I say anything funny or if anybody does I would have just stolen theirs I will write it down in my little book and then I ask hey I'll have it and you know and so we have already after the show we're like ah what about a cat acts more like he he you're a guy  ship and the next day at blackout again I couldn't remember a thing but I remember I had that book you know so I ran over the book nowhere of a lie open the book all it says is that's really funny if the giant letters  I took the airplane and I was afraid you know I get afraid in the airplane I'll tell you that yeah I'm not I'm not gonna lie to you what's that thing where they go if the thing comes down I don't like that one if the oxygen mask comes down make sure to put it on your face before your little child and I go well that was my plan you you don't have to blab at everybody I love my little child and everything but he's never been on a TV  anyway he just lied to you say oh by the way if the jet crashes at 900 miles an hour into the ocean don't worry about it or nothing on account of your uh seat cushion is a boat and you're like oh gray it's a boat yeah why did I ever buy a boat now that I think about it I could have got a fleet of seat cushions come purchase buying that boat the only time you do survive in an airplane crash and this time this is one of the reasons I believe in God if you crash into the Andes why can't they let you die then you know that's when you survive and that's because I thank God you know yeah he likes a good laugh as much as an accident so he's like I'm not going to kill these people I'll let them live for a while  and then after 40 or 50 days they'll have to Grapple with a ethical dilemma you know  cannibalism I'm talking about cannibalism and listen I'm against cannibalism if you know anything about me you know tireless work I've done on anti-cannibalism I've done too much work them I'm not gonna do it anymore man can only do so much but and I'm not going to preached you and I uses some kind of bully political cannibals because you guys are adults your views on cannibalism are said and you know what I mean you're not going to change your mind I like to get young people you know that's why I travel all across this great continent you know except for Mexico I'm not going to  Mexico but like America and Canada you know and uh and I talked to the kids right the kids in high school the kids in in elementary school you know and I try to tell them I go listen kids you might think it's cool that you you ain't your buddy in algebra class and I'm not gonna lie to you you will be the attack of the school for quite some time but the future the future I go like this you know but the thing when they crash into the the Andes here's their big problem they haven't thought it out you see what I mean so they're so maddened by hunger right at the time that uh because they've waited 30 40 50 days to decide whether to eat the co-pilot or whoever and so now they're they're just so hungry they just tear into the ah you know they got co-pilot all over their shirt anyways that's not a healthy way to eat that's the only point I'm trying to make I've been studying nutrition lately I was thinking of becoming a nutritionist for our time and that one thing they said almost all nutritionists agree on this  don't Gorge I can leave you with anything they talk about crazy instead of the three meals we've been taught you know we're like where I came from has been changed now you're supposed to have like eight meal it's called grazing so in other words in the morning you will you would have a small portion of co-pilot you know and then mid afternoon a small portion of Copa you know  now all this is because you didn't think it through you know and I'm here to tell you because I'm an old man and you're a young man honestly but I can tell you as a young man that there are a lot of eventuality is going to be thrown at you in this your life and you better be ready for him you better have a plan you know I got a plan for everything you know I mean we were I have a plan for cannibals and we were we were we were flying here from Vegas to come here and there was a little turbulence and uh immediately I was like I'm eating the in 14e got a guy on the way yeah you look delicious if you crash right in an airplane on paper there's nothing left like they will show if they have a big airplane crash they just go there with cameras and you never see a body or a guy like this or you know you never see anything because they've all been vaporized just turned into I don't know stuff ashes ashes stuff to stuff scriptures say  and then the relatives they want the stuff they don't call it stuff they call remains we'd like the remains you know because they walked some closure I'm in I can understand that you know they're at home they're like I can't go to sleep you know every night I just worry about Phillips last moments and that downward spiral if only I could see his remains good sleep put this whole thing behind me  I understand but who knows what grief God damn I wish I had a word oftentimes I'll start a sentence hoping a word will show up so I said who knows what grief where did you go  so I think there's a lesson for all of us in that there's no lesson or anything hey I'm I'm not a wise person but I'll tell you this I'm I'm a lot wise with the people we're the old days this is what in the old days if you wanted to read something wise right you had to read a whole big long  book was maybe how sleepy you think of nine days and then there'd be one sentence and he'd go God damn that's wise I remember that sentence right nowadays all you have to do is go to a cup store every cup you look at says the wisest  thing you ever heard okay yeah I'm gonna buy that cup and just read it every day now that cup that Cup's a wiser  God does any of this make any sense to anybody   I will say this I'm getting older you know I mean uh I suppose we could all say that in a way but uh I met at the certain I'm at an age where uh like three or four times a day I will check the status of my left arm have you ever done that you know this is all I know about medicine  I go to doctors uh I don't know if I'm a hypochondriac I don't I think I'm just I know like first attack is important so I always want to go to the doctor you know and sometimes you do one thing and it sticks with you and I know I know what I did one time and they started talking to the doctors talk to each other whatever but they think I'm a hypochondriac because one time I had a pap smear foreign turns out I'll never get cervical cancer but anyways I like going to specialist you know I mean like let's say my foot hurts I go hey I'd like to go to a foot doctor but you can't do that you can't just go up a day you have to go to a regular doctor and then the regular doctor goes God damn you gotta go a foot doctor  so I gave you the name just pay Agnes eighty dollars on the way out you're like  if you want me to take your blood pressure I've retired from getting my goddamn blood pressure yeah I think I had my blood pressure about probably six seven thousand times what good is a doctor if he can if I can do the same thing that uh CVS can do what kind of doctor is that so yeah no no I don't want your goddamn he was all right can I interest you into hitting your knee with a hammer here's one can you believe we still allow this to we must be seriously this is like from the cartoons back in the 50s a doctor says to us can I hear any with a hammer oh yeah sure sure so then it takes the hammer or hits your knee and they're like I have my knee and they race now it's like excellent it's exactly how you should react when you're struck her name  your leg is not paralyzed I'm going to put an X besides is your leg paralyzed okay you just pay Agnes out of the way up sometimes they'll use smart words you ever have that because they're doctors and you're not and so they know all the smart words whenever I say God Damn I don't know what I got I'm tired all the time you'll sound like chronic fatigue syndrome I said what's that this is what crime means always fatigue means tired and a syndrome is something you got famous on the web Agnes piano less horseshit in my mind I trust as far as I get sure I realize doctors can't give you a good news when you think about it think about this for a second right a doctor will never come back go well Mrs Jorgensen very very little lady because ladies and men right Hey listen Mrs Jorgensen we checked your blood panel and uh good news you're immortal  you have to come back no more no  no they can only give you a reprieve of bad news yet to come yeah they go we've looked at your blood panel everything is perfect Tip Top you're in the perfect shape so uh just go on with your life come back every year and then one day  it's not gonna be good uh if I ask for instance if I say to you Catherine if I say maybe your husband should come in that's a clue  bananas expect to cry expect to have your mind shattered like a crystal vase you may even plead with me to give your life you know I've had that believe me people are funny all right my uh is how old I'm getting and I don't mean to be morbid but I you got to get things in order right and I know I'm getting old I have a white beard I paint my head black or whatever color the guy paints it for me but I keep my white beard so that when I look in the mirror I know you know what I mean because I feel that God gives us white hair as a warning it's just you know it's his way of saying hey you know get your Affairs together because  so anyways I had a white beard I got to go make out a will so I made out of will I got everything planned my funeral is going to be you know how funerals are like uh all sad and everything like that instead of you know instead of having a party they're all sad so that's what I'm going to do I have a real sad one nobody have any  fun and and everybody can only talk about me I wrote it all down you know what if I could lead a life where after my death like at my funeral somebody could no longer go on I think I would have accomplished something  if somebody doesn't leap to have to win  now I have uh I have very exact uh things that I want done at my funeral you know I this is what one thing I'm going to have the people come and look at my body I understand people like looking at dead people so they can all come and Gander at my corpse but then at the end I just want my closest friends to just circle talk about the good times and reminisce and try to bring me back to life that's how because every funeral I've been I go that might be I don't know shouldn't we shave covers up they don't let you shake them  most of my stuff is about shaking I go shake the out of me don't worry about my to shake me a lot and do this hit my chest like this here I dread a little picture you know guys you gotta get an Epitaph you know for your gravestone to say yeah man you're funny you know you're a comedian and I'm like yeah I don't think so because here's the problem you make your little funny joke and then they come and they visit you you know and then the next time they come and visit you like oh yeah there's that joke and then the third time they go the same  joke about the guy that read that  joke one more time I'm never going to visit Norm's gravesite again he'll just be in the Dustbin of History so instead what I have I'm going to have is a big neon sign which will Just Go For Eternity you know as long as my estate can afford it none of it will go to my children right well I'll go to this neon sign and the neon sign will flash forever with the flash be sad now be sad now because people have to know you know I even got a living will now this a living will is a different thing this is for if you're ever in a situation where you you're in a coma and you can't make a decision for yourself then you haven't pre-written you know so you your wishes are on uh are on record and uh it's mostly to do with the plug and I bring anybody down or not like that but uh uh I don't know how to say this but you know just statistically like there's 500 people about three of you uh will end up getting plugged into the wall or something sorry to be the one to say it I'm not going to point you out you know because I don't think you ever do that with a big group of people though when you're with when you look at a big group people hey I wonder who kids  if the guy beside you had Shifty eyes just now you know reported I always look for Shifty ass but anyways my uh my living will is pretty simple it's just basically it says uh keep your grubby hands off the plug you know just the plug stays in the wall  my mother said oh you don't want to be a burden I'm like oh sorry oh my God I would hate to to break up your uh once a month bridge game so you could go to the hospital and touch the bag of my hand let me know that I am oh oh sorry I'm a little uh burdened myself here with the plug thank you because if you don't but if you don't make a living well I'm telling you make a living will because if you don't right then your family gets to decide I wonder what they'll decide maybe the thing they decide every single time they don't decide right away you know at first because you know you got somebody in a coma you know it's sad but at the same time you know your bigger friends and you go check this out she used to cook cherry pies and yeah that gray thing there had the hopes and dreams and show you I'm not kidding you but like anything else the novelty wears out and then then they started getting a little peeve that they have to keep making these hospital visits you know and then that's what my brother would go hey Doc I remember he was asking me if Norm ever has said anything about this and uh last night I was thinking about it by God I don't know if this counts but one time we were having dinner and he says to me he says or I said to him I said what would happen if you had to be plugged into the wall and uh he said to me that we should kill him and then we get to go back and live our lives again right yep foreign sense like what would a person say let's say a person's in a coma you wake them out there wake they're awoken for one minute and you go Hey listen friend we only got a minute uh here's the uh the choice I want you to make sounds kind of ridiculous now that I'm saying it out loud but uh would you rather lie here on the bed with the TV or uh  uh they're bury you underneath the Earth because that's a question  the first one I in my living will it's not even one plug it's a series of intertwining plugs with surge protectors and a byzantines sort of because I don't want one of those janitors with a wise broom yeah those guys we're gonna hit my plug my brother's living on a five in the hallway I know I know the Wicked Ways of men  but seriously I feel we have gotten a little more but I don't like it don't lay it one bit let's think of something life-affirming huh what babies yeah not better than babies what a rich comedic territory then I've never done a single funny thing about a baby  they're wonderful I know that's not the funniest take you're ever gonna hear on babies but  are they really really but are they really yeah they are really I mean not baby tarantulas I mean not baby alligators I may not baby crocodiles can't they call those the same things it's like an alligator has a fight in front snow you gotta give a I'm just gonna call it whatever I feel like sad thing I watch a lot of bad nature shows they were talking about the ice stretch and I thought what a weird  animal because when God was making all the foul of the of the the firmament you know  he's like all right go ahead next Who's Next okay we're doing all the foul okay okay hey ostrich are you ready and then the ash is like hey before I go listen man I've been trying out my wings and  and I'll run real fast go like this and then I don't get no liftoff something wrong something and guys like oh yeah yeah uh why'd that be cool is to make a bird that can't fly yeah I said oh yeah yeah well boy how come I got Wings then that makes you a bird you return look and then I was just like listen I don't mean no disrespect or nothing but what happens when I'm running and and then the wolf is chasing me and I go I try to fly and the wolf eats me and the guy's like huh I don't know damn it all at all he was asked was a question hey how about this the ice is chasing right what you do you stop you put your head in the sand you can't see the ostrich how can the answer see you I mean they're flat it I'm sorry look just let me start that well it's great to be here in Hollywood   I apologize so um thank you what should we talk about babies baby music is that what you said music is a great thing you ever get a music thing that bugs you like there's one song uh by uh uh Elton John he goes uh um if I were a sculptor but then again no or a traveling Minstrel or a something show and I thought you can't do that and it's not you can't go if I were a sculptor but then again noted you have to just can't you don't write the line like it wouldn't make any sense there's this other one it's Rod Stewart The First Cut is the Deepest he goes the first cat is the demon he goes I'll try to love again but I know the First Cut is the Deepest right but if First Cut is the Deepest then this one won't be so bad it really should be you know I'll try to love again but I know the second Cut is the Deepest you know what I mean I'm gonna be scared the second one's coming up instead or he can go hey I'll love your shirt okay you know why because the first Cut's the deepest I got nothing to worry about now all right I know it's I said also I gotta stop saying and I apologize I uh here's a funny thing you know one time I I did my stupid stand-up and a lady did a review of the show and she said Norm uses the word a lot in his act which shows how incredibly stupid he is and then I thought hey wait a minute she said stupid are you allowed to say that yeah I mean stupid people it's not their fault and context we all know as well as everything you know and here is I'm going to tell you the exact context of my what I was talking about when I was talking about retards I wasn't talking I was talking about people with damn sinning so here was the context and you tell me if this context doesn't in any way and ameliorate the meaning this is what I said about retards I love returns that was what I said and I do I I know my best friend when I was a kid was a and my parents forced it but it turned out it was fun it was cool and then I remember like five years ago there was I live in an apartment for apartments down there was this 19 year old kid who was a retire and I was I wanted to be his friend but his parents would have none of it for obvious reasons  the cynical world we live right like I want to but anyways  what I wanted from him and what I see I don't pity retards and I use the word because I don't want to say Down syndrome because then people think I'm a doctor and then they're gonna want me to hit their name of that hammer you know so I say return because I understand it's at a certain point not an insult they're they've been arrested and they're developed they returned to them so but they're happy and uh that's what we all want so what other people pity I envy if there was like uh like a like something some juice that you could put into your arm like I would be at the front of the line together you know because happiness how often are you happy I'm happy a little bit like when I wake up I'm happy I think because the first thing in the morning I wake up like ah glad I bought that Tempur-Pedic pillow that was the best thing I ever bought but then you know the light comes in and then my memory of my life my life's all around like ah what where am I again and then I go in the bathroom I look at that's the worst moment of me in the morning looking I'm not talking about physically like your looks but you look right in your own eyes at least me I look in I go whenever they become what the and at that point I would like my friend to be standing there going like I like bananas foreign a guy like yeah they're yellow bananas  once I see very happy and so I don't understand Penny in The Mug I see it all the time people like oh look at them all over there laughing makes me want to shake my head sadly the problem is they don't realize what a horror life really is now the worst part is there's no cure you know those people will probably die happy again I have to shake my head sadly I thought of such a thing that's good Red Bull um so I'm trying to think of something happy I know we've dealt with babies crimp death here's an interesting thing think about the crib business how strong the crib business is that it survived crib death  you feel once once that became a thing crib dead you know mothers and fathers would go you know maybe let the kids sleep with us it's just that that crimp death that's that's the only thing that bothers me it's like a death bed you know I won't buy one of those  at some point you gotta just decide you know what's worth it and you know a death bed even a sick bed I don't like to see if I can understand any of this horseshoe I wrote down no but that's religion you know and religious personally you know and it's not good you know when I was a kid I felt everyone was religious when I was a kid and nowadays you say you're religious people you think you're a hey Bill my tell me how you go he goes oh my God what is why are you so dumb and I'm like wow I don't know I'm dumb compared to Bill Maher obviously who isn't but no no you know maybe I'm not strong enough to be an age less I don't know maybe I'm not smart enough but I do know one thing if I was an atheist I'd never try to talk anybody else into it that's what I think's wrong just plain wrong you know what I mean like why why what's the upside of that you know you go excuse me you over there you yes with the glint of Hope in your eyes come on over here I want to tell you something you're born you get real sick and you die they put them dirt on you when I come over to my house and talk about it all day with my friends that's all we do we have a podcast I read the Jesus Christ now it's and I'm not one of these guys you know every anybody can get to heaven you know what I mean it has nothing to do there's a million different ways of getting to Heaven you know as long as you're a good person and you're kind and you try to do well with others and you have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ  anyone can get in you know I read that Jesus Christ is now considered a historical figure almost a hundred percent which to me is doesn't really matter you know if it's Divinity if it's either he's Divine or he's not like my friend he said you know I uh I really like Jesus you know I really like but I don't think he's a God or Son of God or anything like that I think he's just an ordinary guy but you know he had great things to say I'm like what kind of church is that Jesus was just an ordinary guy that's your contention well you're doing a sermon you're like once uh Mark 4 verses 14 to 16 Jesus stood in front of the masses and in front of him he had four loaves of bread and four glasses of wine and the the masses looked unto Jesus and Jesus said unto the masses sorry man there's only enough here for me so I Jesus was just an ordinary guy one time Jesus went to uh the Sadducees and the Pharisees at the temple and they were having a party and the music was loud and Jesus called Peter to come unto him and he said Peter you shall be the rock unto you shall the church be a founder and Peter said unto Jesus sorry man what was that I wasn't listening there was a girl and Jesus said no it doesn't matter it's not none  that's cool and Jesus went into the corner and soaked all night and wouldn't talk to anybody not even the chicks Jesus was just an ordinary guy this was interesting I Found Jesus is considered a historical figure I always figured that but did you know this here's a kind of surprising one Jesus H Christ was also a real person I mean that one buckled my knees a real guy also from Bethlehem he lived only a couple of blocks from Jesus that's why he used the h because he was always being confused you know oh Let Me Touch the Hem of you now you want the cabinet maker over there God damn man I'm a day laborer he's a he works fine can you Jeff we could just touch your hand if you stop at the hand of the Garment would you I'm Jesus age cry I should have just gone with Harold  and a very sad ending at the end uh there were all these leopards and they uh they were all following Jesus H Christ and they were all like can we touch the hammer yes I know of my Garmin this no you can't you're a bunch of lepers and he runs away but the leopards get him in time and then he gets leprosy and uh  and then I think in his final moments he curses uh Jesus himself and uh gets raped by the devil for all the time it was one of the saddest endings for many of them oh my gosh isn't there finding out some this is what I've always felt and first of all you know when I when I used to have a Chris I'm not trying to say I'm better than you you know Christians this is a I think people don't understand Christians don't think they're better than anybody they think they're the worst like they can't you know they're all worthless they need you know Jesus are they're no good they're Sinners and it's true you can't stop sinning for some reason you know like take me I try my best I swear to God I try to be a good Christian I eat an apples now it's on page one of the book worst thing you do eat a apple oh here's the thing some I feel the religious stuff will be over soon I feel some of the command are easy to follow it's not very difficult like Thou shalt not kill well good Lord if you can't follow that yeah I mean you should be able to follow that but then other ones like Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's oxen okay and first of all I feel this is unfair because many people their neighbors don't have an ox so it's easy for them but what about me I got an ox it's scraggly all ass this thing I got it from a Mexican doesn't matter what where he came from but I should have bought it new is what I'm saying and I get at home it's all scraggly I felt a little kind of sorry for him his wife whatever but again I'm home he's all scraggly and he's like walks weird and he's got a big hump and  and I so I thought the biggest guy go hey what the up with the ox he goes oh yeah he's got bursitis he's like as long as he doesn't have to pull things I'm like yeah come on so anyways I got my goddamn Ox no he's nice but I got him in my garage right now then My Neighbor Next Door I go by his house and uh his uh garage door is wide open big coincidence and what stands there but the most beautiful like lustrous kind of chestnut Belgian Ox I've ever seen in my life you know and he's like what do you think would you like to pet my ah you know I have my own ox but I'm coveting like a I don't know how you can pass that yeah foreign psychology thing you know because it makes me feel like I can't understand myself because now they say all kinds of things you know they say you can have repressed memories you know about this like how you recover a memory like 30 40 years pass and you suddenly remember something you know that's never good you know it's never like God damn I used to like peaches yeah sorry eating more peaches it's always the most violent sexual hell that you went through that was so impossible to digest by your Consciousness that your self-consciousness came through but here's what I don't like about it I used to like I'd be at a party and somebody would come and be like hey Norm your uncle ever your ass and I would say with pride no  but I can't say that anymore because there's actually two possibilities my uncle never my ass or my uncle my ass all the time and I forgot so really the only fear to that is I go I don't know 50 50. my advanced math degree coming through but I'm most needed I don't I don't feel personally I don't even know if I believe in recovered memories I don't if I do have one God damn please let me never recover it it's hard enough to go through life you know but we have to go through life you know those guys God damn so I wanted to be going down a cheese store with my friend going hey man what are we getting the kind of cheese sandwich you're getting today same cheddar yeah what do you mean you'll get one or or two I don't know it's probably one what about you know what me what's the matter man all right just to because honey from the ages of 9 to 13. my uncle my ass everything  go live my life I'll talk to you later but I don't know who knows what it is and what isn't good morning well the show ended a long time ago I didn't have to hurt you guys but we're all hot we want to get we want to get a team we want to go to those tables  I'll I'll end by saying one day it's just it's just a psychology thing as we're talking about psychology my body everything psychology this guy everything has a different meaning you know I mean so I remember when I was eating dinner with a guy I love milk you know know so I had a nice glass of milk I was just about to eat it I drink the milk I mean I'm just about to drink the milk and my friend says he goes you know why you're drinking that milk right and I go I know it's not because I like milk a lot I know this guy and he goes nah it's not that at all he goes what it is is you uh Miss sucking on your mother's breasts so now I can't what am I going to guzzle the milk down at this point the milk's finished now for the meal and my mother I mean you guys don't know my mother but my Lord you know an 85 year old woman and I love her and I couldn't love anybody more my mother you know she lives right beside me I have an apartment and she lives in the next apartment but go see her there she said yeah I'll go see my mother she lives next door to me sorry for being such a dick beat son foreign you know me too it started and me too to me is a great Revolution I've never lived through any sort of Revolution like there's a social Revolution where women who have basically been slaves since the dawn of time are now taking their rightful place and so our children are grandchildren that are girls will be able to live a full life so this is a beautiful thing every revolution has casualties and what and I was thinking about this the other day what might be a woman like my mother and you probably know uh maybe it's your mother maybe it's your grandmother depending on your age but my mother's the type person like she would uh we would eat you know and she would always be just in the kitchen and everybody got do you have the gravy or Bill do you need more with the turnips and okay don't forget dessert leave enough for dessert and I go ma you got enough to eat up there oh yeah but she would just be eating like what was left you know and then we'd finish Chico you boys who watch the TV or do you need to help watch no no I do I take and you know I don't think women are gonna be like that uh and and my mother her eyes shine with love you know I wish I could love it with the intensity that she does but so effortlessly like she um she and when she speaks there's never a a moment of irony that comes from her and she like she goes she went to the store the other day and uh he came back she said Norm the funniest story that happened in the story I said what was it she goes there was a woman she bought a pineapples 1.69 but last week was a dollar nineteen that's I don't even know if it's a story but I you know I would uh trade trade my life with hers because she had this incredible capacity that I don't have ah but anyways whatever I don't even know I have to tell you all this but oh I remember I don't want to suck a tits  crazy man maybe that makes me shallow hey you guys win out there tonight okay I love you okay

his head as it often would and he grabbed me and he hauled me in and I thought I was in with a strapping in my life you know what it is he put out his giant cigar less than half the size of my arm this big cigar stuck in my mouth lit It Up made me smoke it all the way through right to the end that's when I started smoking cigars real heavy I have planned backfired on him and there was another time I remember now that I'm thinking about it I was behind the garage again as luck would have it and uh this time I was smoking a big fat joint back there don't do drugs and uh my dad's big head showed up again and there's no body this time just a big head that was the funny part you like to mix it up like that you know so anyways he grabbed me there with his teeth and he hauled me in and uh I thought I was there with a strapping of my life you know but uh injecting me with Heroin size it was a strict man I'll tell you that but you gotta quit smoking that's all I know man you got a Christmas not all I know I know other things too but uh be a kind of a wasted life if that's all they combed out of a dare but you gotta quit smokers otherwise you get old and then unhealthy you know

leafing through a Jughead comic I see him over there so I think to myself I say hey I'm going to sidel up beside uh old Ben Matlock yeah and I'm going to grab one in big books myself he didn't have to know nothing sure pretty soon we get in a conversation we start talking and uh and I I find out how he ever saw that case where clad uh Claude Akins killed you remember anyways whatever I wanted to talk right so uh take 10 minutes I'm talking to him I'm talking to him he's very friendly very outgoing and everything like that and it was really nice then all of a sudden I realized it wasn't Ben Matlock at all really it's not Andy Griffith yeah just some old man and uh now don't you think that this guy has a moral you know a responsibility to tell people instantly that he's not I don't know that's a good question I never thought of that yeah what else I like about the magic phone Wikipedia oh you ever use that that's the best man it makes a democracy out of smartness everybody's equal

my name you know when the people when the people here asked me to do the show you know I gotta say I felt kind of weird you know I don't know if you remember this but I used to actually be on this show you know I used to do the Weekend Update news routine you remember that and uh yeah that's where I did the make-believe news jokes you know that was me right so then a year and a half ago right I had a sort of a disagreement with the management at uh at the NBC uh I wanted to keep my job right and they felt the exact opposite so so you see they like they fired me because they said that I wasn't funny you know now now with most jobs I could have had a hell of a lawsuit on my hands for that but but see this is a comedy show so they got me you know you know what you know but now this is a weird part right it's only a year and a half later and now they asked me to host the show so I wondered I go hey wait a second here hey I don't know how did I go in a year and a half from being not funny enough to be even allowed in the building to being so funny that I'm now hosting the show how did I suddenly get so damn funny thank you it was inexplicable to me because a year and a half let's face is not enough time for a dude to learn how to be fun then it occurred to me I haven't gotten funnier the show has gotten really bad  so yeah I'm funny compared to you know how well you'll see later but  okay so let's recap the bad news is I'm still not funny the good news is the show blows all right folks we got a bad show for you tonight Dr Dre Snoop Doggy Dog and Eminem are here who are safer drivers men or women well according to a new survey 55 percent of adults feel that women are most responsible for minor fender benders while 78 blame men for most fatal crashes please note that the percentages in these pie graphs do not add up to 100 because the math was done by a woman of you hissing at that joke it should be a noted that that joke was written by a woman so now you don't know what the hell to do today foreign  thank you

Norm Macdonald,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu2cYSt4a6A,right now it is my pleasure to introduce a very funny man all right let's calm down calm down he's he's still just a regular guy kick back relax and enjoy this evening's very special entertainment known for his dry wit the saturday night live weekend update commentator and for his movies dirty work and screwed and the norm show please a wonderful omaha welcome for norm mcdonald   hey brian hey guys what's up man hi yeah man it's live it's saturday night you guys have a bunch of uh of uh twinkly things they didn't tell me everything before i got out here they didn't tell me that they'd be they'd be twinkling things but i can deal with it but now listen i was uh it hurting me back listening to uh the beautiful uh speaking like you know because i remember that you know it's 10 it's 8 o'clock and do you know where your children's at and stuff and hearken back to me because a half hour earlier i was saying the same thing i was in the restaurant i was like 7 30 may anybody know where my pork chop is you ever try to get a pork chop with this joint i mean like you always like pork you don't like pork call yourself americans no listen i'll tell you something i'll tell you something about this restaurant i don't know about it in here if you get special stuff but where i was eating uh i asked for a coca-cola because that's my favorite drink you know i go hey man can i have a coca-cola and i say we all got that we got pepsi cola i was like oh and this is a new thing that's happening i've noticed across the country i'd like to get to the bottom of it because uh coca-cola is the is a delicious drink and oftentimes you go to a town you go hey man where do i go to get a coke and they're like yeah not here fella yeah they have their towns that pepsi is somehow even though coke and people see they think in their minds they think that if your favorite drink in the entire world is coca-cola then your second favorite drink will be pepsi cola which is flawed reasoning actually if your first favorite drink is coca-cola your least favorite drink is pepsi cola that's how it works and you can tell they're kind of a shame you got a coke they're like nah pepsi that they give you like that is that okay so yeah no i don't want that what else you got you got any other soda and then when they got the pepsi they always have these weird other sodas like oh yeah we got different we got uh you like root beer we got that they're like well i'm not eight i don't know we got diet pepsi what the why are you even asking me that i just said we got sierra mist oh i'm glad man i'm glad you brought that up i was going to ask but i didn't dare you know because every time i go they don't have it but that's my favorite drink you know you go to a restaurant you go hey here's the white fish what do you want with that give me guys sarah mist give me that what no sierra miss what kind of hen house horse  is this trying to run a joint here what kind of business honey get your coat i'll get the car i'll bring the car around you get your coats no sierra miss can you believe his characters kind of a kind of a but no i had a pork i had a nice delicious uh piece of pork a pork chop you know pork i don't know i don't think it's that good for you but i like it i'm pretty sure it's not good for you because it's a pig but but i like it anything with a snout i don't think you're supposed to eat i think that may be in the scriptures i'm not sure but i recall something about that my doctor has me on a snoutless diet right now he says i gotta exercise every day aerobics and uh latissimus dorsi all that  you know get my back and everything and then no snouts but no uh my friend i tell you let me tell you something my friend who is a vegetarian she's a girl you know like all the vegetarians are and uh you know i mean a lot of dudes you know but anyway she was talking to me about the vegetarianism and stuff right now i have you ever have you ever had this experience where you think uh something's right your whole life you know and then in a moment in a flash you realize you've been wrong about everything you've ever believed ever not everything but that one thing by the way if you ever wake up and you realize you've been wrong about everything in your entire life that's not a good day then you may as well may as well go down to the rope store and buy yourself a length of rope then go down to the stool store get yourself a nice stool then you go over to the notepad store you buy yourself a notepad you really then you get a pen you only really need four things and it must be hard to write those notes you know when i'm supposed to write it on this little thing everything that drove me to in my life look good i don't know where to start but um what was i talking about oh yeah pork no because my friend who's a vegetarian this girl she was telling me you know she we always argue because she's a vegetarian and i am not a vegetarian and so she uh you know she uh she has her opinions and i have my opinions and i realize that her opinions are actually stronger than my opinions like she'll say to me she goes you can't eat you know animals that because they're god's creatures too you know what i mean and uh we you shouldn't uh destroy another uh creature of our great god just so that you could have a frivolous meal that would not be necessary you can't extinguish the life of a you know and then i go i like pork that's my opinion that's not a good argument at all so the upshot of it is that people can change thank god uh you know through the glory of god people can come to changes in life and i am now a vegetarian so that's nice you know thank you very much i'm not a strict vegetarian i eat meat but i am a i'm a vegetarian but not a strict one i only eat meat you know what i don't like is vegetables i can't eat those i can't i can't stand eating vegetables so in the strictest turn we're you know strictest use of the word you know strict i'm not a strict vegetarian but you know what she does my friend that is a vegetarian she makes this thing every thanksgiving i don't know if you've ever eaten this it's called a tofu tofurky tofu it's a very it's an unwieldy word no one likes to hear it but it's a it's a turkey but it's not really a turkey yeah sounds like a turkey because it's got a lot of the same letters but what they do is they take tofu you see and then they fashion it into the countenance of a turkey yeah which doesn't fool me and also i don't understand why she does it on account of she's making it into the thing that she doesn't want to eat in the first place you know that seems  i would not do that you know like i might i'm against cannibalism you know as you all know as any of you know that follow me on the google space ww i i have gone across this country with my anti-cannibal stance you know talking to people from one side of this great nation to the other every year i put my toe in the pacific and i travel this great land with my anti-cannibal message yeah mostly the young people i try to educate the young people you know i go to the schools and i go listen listen you might think that you're going to be the cool guy because you need a dude friend of yours you know and maybe you will for a couple of years you know maybe you'll be the big man on campus oh that's jim he ate a fella but there's more to it than that no i have i i i you know i i i use my time for for you know what i do i do a lot of charity work for things that that people i don't like arguing with people you know when they have another opinion than me so what i do is i pick very popular opinions and then i work for those people like for instance there was uh uh you know the land mine big thing princess diana one of the greatest people who ever lived she was against landmines so tragically she died you know before her her landmine crusade really got rolling you know and uh and of course it was a terrible tragedy and everything like that and then she died and i so i am hey how about this remember when she died and then elton john wrote that song for but it was the same song that he wrote for marilyn monroe that seems like kind of a  but the king's like hey man you wrote a song from my daughter i don't know if there's a king you see you wrote a song for princess diana yes you all ready she just died an hour ago yeah i wrote it i i wrote it and here it is ah she lived her life like a candle in the wind wait a minute it sounds like that song you wrote a book but marilyn monroe well it's a little bit some of the same words well why'd you do that because they're similar when you think about it come on marilyn monroe she was taking crazy drugs and promiscuous running around man you know you never knew she was going to live or die she's just living her life crazy like a candle in the wind you know and uh princess died she uh lived in a castle but you know they're sort of the same they they were blonde i gotta go but anyways i forgot what i was gonna say oh that i am uh very against landmines so i will go and i will make uh you know i'll go to protests you know and i'll have a big sign says no more landmines because if you don't know about landmines hey you're educating me about stuff tonight i'll educate you a little about land mines you know because there's there's many different causes you know and land mines are terrible what they are is they put them underneath the earth and then you step on them and they blow you up so i go there and i protest against them and what's fun about it is there's very few counter protesters you know there's a couple of guys out there but clearly these guys are in the in the pocket of the you know big land mine uh companies in this country now i don't mean to get all bill maher on you or anything but if you think that the land mine companies in this country care about you the little person they don't care about you they care about blowing you up when you're not expecting it that's how they make their money no whatever but no i was going to say about she makes this tofu tofu and what i was going to say was that as a anti-cannibal guy it would never occur to me to do the same thing as she does with her tofurkey i would not take all my delicious cheese sandwiches and fashion them into the shape of some old rotting corpse of some dude and then then eat that that would make at least less tasty than the cheese sandwich itself to me but listen it's easy to go around saying hey i'm against cannibalism oh i'm anti-cannibalism look at me i'm better than everybody else you know i know it's easy to say because i say it every day to people but uh actually when you think about it you don't really know how you're gonna you know how your how your cannibalism beliefs are going to stand up under  when it comes up because you'll notice in life cannibalism rarely comes up there's always some cheese sandwiches around you can find you but what about when you're in the andes now then all bets are off you have to wrestle with your conscience because you're in the andes i don't even know why people go to the andes but they do they go hey listen travel agent me and the wife ruth you know ruth we're going uh we got to get away from the kids again this year we got to go to island uh we were hoping something on the other side of the andes anything you got there we just want to relax lay on a hammock or something and uh we want to go to a nice place that is separated from where we are now by the andes and get any small planes we like flying in small area foils in the dead of winter the anything like that and they're like yeah so you get on the plane and you know 20 minutes later you crash into a mountain you know because everyone knows it's it's on the boarding pass it says layover a mountain so you crash into the mountain and then you know you gotta you know you gotta wrestle with your conscience you know because uh you know you're down there and the guy in 24 e's looking pretty delicious and uh and so days turn into weeks and weeks turn into months months you know how time works right i don't have to explain everything then becomes now so time trap and then you have to wrestle with your conscience because you're like ah my conscience and your conscience is very you know if you you don't want to wrestle with your conscience because you know although it's not as hard as wrestling with an actual wrestler if you have your choice between wrestling with your conscience and wrestling with a like a professionally trained wrestler i take the conscience because uh doesn't even have arms and for wrestling like the headlock is the biggest move if you don't have arms so anyways you're wrestling with your conscience and you're like oh man should i eat that guy in 24e i don't know it looks pretty good but i i i don't think it's right and all this stuff and then and then time goes on and you get and instead of just acting right away which would probably be the smarter thing you know you wait way too long and months pass and then you go crazy and then you go after frank that's his name in 24e and uh you're just ah you're so hungry now you're tearing into me like ah frank blood all over the area yeah anyways and that's the last and this is what you don't want to have happen at that point is for the rescue plane to come over at that very moment you know well you're like ah what the they're like we have hamburgers and hot dogs here on the plane and delicious cheese sandwiches everything you want here you're like ah what a lot of snow oh lord god let me get a drink of this water you like water it's better than that pepsi  ow water's good for you what about everybody have guys that have for their favorite water they're like ah fiji that's what i drink water fiji water it's the most tasteless colorless water of all this one has zero fat like i'm a  like i like i wouldn't be able to detect globules of fat in my water it's cyanide free no but listen man i'm not afraid no monsters you know you know what you know we spend when you think about man we spent most of our adult life petrified of monsters you know and uh i'm just coming to the i'm saying enough man you know i'm not gonna live under the tyranny of these monsters that walk among us you know they get me to get me and some of them i'm not even i don't even know what's so scary about them like now they got a movie i seen wolfman you know which is very scary right a wolf man you know they got a movie and it's like a werewolf i think it's exactly the same i'm not sure i haven't studied it close enough but i believe like if a wolf man came at you and stuff you went ah a werewolf people wouldn't go that's a wolf man you idiot but my point is this i am not afraid of a wolf man or a werewolf because when you think about what they are they're half man and half wolf so therefore i am only half afraid of them as i am of a wolf and there's no movie called the wolf see if you got a wolf man he half the time he's a man you can reason with him yeah you can sit down have a cheese sandwich but a wolf man you can't reason with a wolf a wolf only wants to eat you so i'm not afraid of a werewolf i'm not afraid of uh ghosts they don't scare me you know no no i mean i don't wanna i don't wanna say i'm invulnerable to uh fear but uh they simply don't frighten me yeah first of all what do they do you know they just go ah which that's not that scary to me yeah and then they're invisible they're like ah and you're like what you're invisible you put your hand through them that that kind of a person never frightens me you know the kind of guys that frighten me ever meet those guys where you can't put your hand through them i don't care for those fellas but when i can put my hand through them doesn't scare me in the least i was at a hotel a couple weeks ago in the lobby they were saying they're they were bragging about there was a ghost in the hotel yeah how scary is it can that be you know what i mean they're like oh every every night mary with the blue dress that was her nickname she was murdered and she hangs around the bed you know what i mean and she'll come over and so beware whoa cause mary with a blue dress which was her nickname which was an odd nickname because you'd think her nickname would be mary the ghost when they came time to pick out her nickname you know i think they were like oh they go hey everyone what do you notice about mary that makes her distinctive we gotta come up with a nickname for her i know she wear a lot of blue dresses she seems to have an affinity to wear blue dresses talking about mary right the transparent lady so i would call her mary the ghost in any of us and all they seem to do is complain these ghosts do you remember that i was like i can't everything's wrong they're never happy or nothing you know like i have to something bad happened to me and if i don't get it cleared up i have to travel all through the world in in pain and sorrow you know and then i'm like well i do too what the hell at least you get to walk through walls and stuff let's do cool stuff i think i have some more water i love water you know i used to do news on saturday and live and sometimes people think i know something about news what's the funny part because i don't know anything about news and uh like i'll watch it on the tv and i don't know what they're talking about you know and um but i watch it all the time you know i'll turn on the tv and then they go uh welcome the deficit i've heard that word before yeah that's but but i watch it you don't have to know about everything you know when i was young you have to know about anything now you have to know about everything everybody got an opinion and stuff yeah supposed to know about every single one guy asked me a couple weeks ago he goes norm how do you feel about stem cell research i was like me why i go to scientist school for 10 years and then i'll come back here to this very spot and i'll tell you what those three words mean i don't know i don't know that's mostly my answers and a lot of people don't know well you'll see on that if you ever watch the news you ever see the news it's not at six they show the news right and they'll have a question and p a lot of people don't know just like me they'll have a question they'll show a pie chart so they'll say does president barack obama deficit reduction question mark some of that then they show a pie chart you know so you go oh man that looks like a pie you know you get happy and then they have like a cut up and i'll say like 47 yes 48 no 5 i don't know so that's like me you know there's no shame in that no shame at all well if i phone them every time there's a one of those things on cnn like one of those polls i phone up i want to get on that pie chart you know iphone up i go hello excuse me is this a tv yeah you just asked me a question i don't know how am i supposed to know i don't understand most of the words in the question what's that cost a buck and a half is that what it said at the start of it excellent all right i better get on that pie chart i'll tell you that i don't i'm not a guy throw away uh 12 bits on you know nothing to tell you quite be quite honest with you nothing oh look at that so um yeah i don't know a lot about stuff you know like sometimes when i go to parties and stuff because everybody got opinions and stuff like that what i'll do is i don't want i go to parties not to not to talk opinions with people and elevate myself or anything like that i go to parties try to find try to get me some free sandwiches you know because i find at parties often you can find if you look cheese sandwiches for free and often what they do is they'll put other stuff in it you have to take it out so you just get the cheese but whatever you know it's free and uh so but the other people i know is they go there to converse and talk of the issues of the day and so forth like that at the parties and i don't like that kind of stuff you know so i tried and i don't know anything see what i mean so what i'll do is before i go to the party i just turn on the tv you know on the one of them channels with news and then there's a guy with a suit and a tie i just say whatever he says i'll say that at the party and it usually works i'll just go to the party and everybody will yap and they'll be like deficit and uh health care trillion trillion billion then i go yeah hey hey i got an opinion listen to this now i blame the media because the media is not entirely without following you think about it i mean you know you gotta you can't just completely say that the media is anybody seen them sandwiches fella over there was telling me there were sandwiches where they cut the crests off and they're in triangles fell over there he said they had toothpicks with frilly toothpicks in him then he is not a single one he is all right fair enough but i have a thing see i can i have a thing where i can judge guys that are at my own smartness level you know what i mean because i don't know if you ever got caught talking to a smart guy you ever have that happen to you that's not a lot of fun like you're at a party and you're at that kitchen part where there's that big square thing i don't know what it is but you're all standing around and then there's five e and three to leave and it's just you and the smart guy and his guy's got a pipe or something he's like anyway how about that leader from the foreign country what about his name you're like ah i'm gonna go ahead and look for them sandwiches but i'm coming back to talk to you i'm not running away if that's what you think i'm not gonna run out that side door right over there and run full speed down the street i don't think that now so what i do i have a very good uh i can i can uh go to my own you know what i mean the people that are at my smartness levels so if i'm in a party right i can go right into the party and immediately like they know you know i say gay guys have gaydar they can sense other gay people i'm like that with like guys at my dumb level i can walk up i can just go immediately i'll say hey i bet i can keep up with that guy over there i'm gonna then i make a b-line over for that character and then we talk about uh you know jughead comics or something for a while i don't know we have a grand old time and i try to pocket a couple of cheese sandwiches and take off but it's hard to talk to anybody just in regular life you know i don't know how to do it especially like one-on-one like talking you know it's so hard to with people um you know like like my friend was saying you gotta listen that's the most important thing in a conversation listen to the person that's talking to you but that's not enough because eventually that other guy will stop talking i'm good at that part but um and then you go oh sorry i forgot to think of something to say there you keep talking and the next time you stop i'll say something so you gotta do two things at once so you gotta listen to the guy everything he's saying plus anything he says that you may know something about you know you gotta keep that in your head for when he stops talking you know what i mean so maybe he's yap and all of a sudden he mentions the like uh fonzie or something like that right so then when you back your edge you hey wait a second i know something about fonzie says this idiot stops talking i'll say my fonzie thing excellent excellent doodly doo doodly  this is what it feels like huh and then maybe the guy changes the subject you're like hold on a second there wait a minute no it's interesting what you're saying now it's interesting hey but what about uh then remember then it was earlier than now you were talking about fonzie yeah anyways interesting thing about fonzie is this it's not his real name arthur fonzarelli that's a true fact man you could google that up on the w all right you talked for a while now it goes on from there but i don't know the news i mean some of the news i understand you know like the the that news isn't real news you know what i mean it's just odd crazy like uh tiger woods uh who's still in it you know in this uh tournament which is depressing for me because i like tiger and stuff and uh and then you know tiger this is tiger victimized himself first of all his family but and all these women and everything but he also victimized the golf fan me you know what i mean the guy i believed in him and i trusted him and uh so it was kind of sad for me because when you because i i don't i don't care if a guy wants to lie down with ladies and stuff like that you know i understand that's a thing guys like to do but i don't like hypocrisy you understand i'm saying i don't like a hypocrite and to me tiger when i was watching him he always presented himself to me as a golfer you know i always thought he was a great golfer i watched him my whole you know and he'd be in the sand hitting it out and then the golf ball come real close you know what i'm into that hole and they put it in and go like that everything so i was all have i go man that guy's a golfer people would ask me who's tiger woods like he's a golfer right now i had no idea he was leading this double life where by day he was a golfer and by night he was laying down with ladies otherwise i never would have bought the buick now i'm driving around a buick people snickering at me and stuff you know whatever now he's a sex addict and uh that's a hard one i imagine i imagine that's a tough one to kick wouldn't that be the worst like those mean like a sexaholic what if they have those meaning what are they gone they always say aholic it's only really works with alcohol but uh yeah uh like sex uh hey yeah for sex that would be a weird i don't know how that would go but you know if you haven't had sex for like a year or something and then you don't want to hear about some guy's relapse yeah guys like i've been weak oh no you don't have to tell us ah i met her in a bar she was gorgeous please you have to hug the guy ah that's too bad that's terrible wow but i don't even know if sex i don't know if that's a thing i don't know you know it's it's weird to me because if you're an ad if you're a heroin addict you're addicted to heroin the more heroin you do the more addicted you are booze addict you're addicted to booze more booze you do bigger attitude you know so to me if you're a sex act let's say you know sometimes you meet these guys like hey man this guy's 70 years old and he's been married since he was 20. still happy still have a healthy sex life still has sex with his wife you know every week or so you know then wouldn't you think that guy's a sex addict he is a sex addict to such a degree that he's willing to have sex with a 70 year old lady that's that's hitting bottom there you know if you're if you're going around getting a whole bunch of different ladies that's not a sex addict that's just a a beautiful lady addict i don't know what you call that but if you're willing to just do anything at all just whatever's beside you after 50 years you're like i don't even like you anymore but ah whatever they do whatever noise they man make don't like those news stories that's scary either man that's why i don't like watching the news no more because when i was a kid just news stories be regular real stuff you know like about the world or whatever but now they'll have little personal stories that have nothing to do with nobody and they present as the news you know and then you don't want to see them you know and i know it's the the latest one they all seem to have the new show elope and the news and there'll be a guy with a suit and a tie so you know he's a news man and he goes he goes hey our top story tonight a lady has vanished they're like oh yeah and they go yes she's not she's gone yeah i am do i know her no you never heard of her but we're gonna tell you about her uh we got bill he's on the outside they have one guy inside one guy outside bill what's going on and then bill's outside he's like uh yeah the lady vanished her name was janice and uh nobody can find hardener however a car was found in the the car is fine it's in the burger king live but we can't find a lady all right back to you and you know so then you're at home you go i don't give a nam on account i never knew her in the first place how can i possibly care as a matter of fact i'm happy it's her and not someone i know so but then they go we'll tell you about it you go no that's cool you know i don't really want to know but they can't help themselves you know they go here or she oh hey billy you're still outside and he's like yeah of course and they go we we understand you have some friends a janice to tell you tell you about yes we've been uh tied with talking to some of her friends anyways turns out she's a good lady breaking news janice was a good lady and we got some of her friends here going to talk about it and then they show a lady and says janice's friend and she says oh janice man she was the greatest she was the kind of person where you could walk into a room and she would light up the whole room you know as amazing she didn't have a light or nothing like that she would just somehow through sheer tyranny of will she could make a room light up some of us thought it was supernatural but and every this is other janice's friend oh janice she was the type of lady i remember that you could always turn to you know sometimes you want to turn your neck you know because you're having troubles you want to you know or your neck hurts whatever but when you turn the person you most want to see in your eye line would be janus you know and then it would say janice's other friend that wasn't one of the first two well janice she um she's the kind of person you could be talking to your best friend the whole world you know and then janice come in and go screw you i'm talking to janice you know you go over to janice she's a better person than you it's janice and so then so then at home you start to get invested in janus you start liking her you know what i mean and every day they show you more about janice you know and they show a different video of home videos over and you're like hey honey look oh i like that hat she's wearing she's eating a piece of pizza you know and you start really liking her you know you go ah man that's that lady's nice i'd like to meet her one day that'd be oh i forgot she vanished oh well they'll find her i'm sure this then you get hope you know and you can't all you can think about is janus you know your feverish dreams are are commanded by janus and spirit you know you can't even think right you know and every day you're turning on the news man what's going on janice and they keep going tell you know and things progress you know and bill still outside and he's like we're still looking it's been three weeks now but as as we speak the uh there everyone's combing the woods behind me as we speak and in your home you're oh no not the woods you don't like to hear that nothing good ever happens in the woods i've seen enough of these stories to realize that janus is not going to come bounding out of the woods anytime soon it's like hey what's going on everybody i'm just taking a stroll through the woods what's going on why are you taking pictures of me anyway what's going on now if they find you in the woods generally they find you in one spot as a matter of fact exclusively every time if you're found in the woods you're found in a shallow grave that's the way it works i don't know why but i've seen enough bill curtis specials to know that shallow grave is where you end one end up certain things you don't want on your uh death certificate one would be shallow grave massive you wouldn't want to see that on your death certificate the word massive or maybe you would i don't know maybe that'd be a good one what about complications that's the one that was confused me like what the  you go hey doc would my dad die again complicated complications he died from them well how'd that work i you told me it was going to be a simple operation yeah we thought it was you're not a doctor are you it looks simple in the book but once we cut them open man a lot of red stringy stuff in your dad very complicated when you get in there really well anyways goodbye so uh but uh yeah you don't want to see shallow grave in in any of your you know in any of the fourth estates account on uh on your uh being dispatched so uh the and also doesn't it seem a little rash a shallow grave you know like after all they're planning these these serial killers they're supposed to be so cunning you know so so diabolical according to the tv movies i've seen and uh doesn't seem a little rash at the end that all of a sudden it's just shallow grave you know it's just wouldn't you think they'd go to a little yeah there's like there you go a couple of leaves and a twig that look doesn't look like janus i remember janice having twigs and leaves all over nobody'll find her a boy scout ain't gonna stumble over her tomorrow morning i know that much i'm going home and uh await the authorities and then home now i would if i ever did that and i would never slaughter and kill a woman i want you to know that i know i say that now who knows can't predict the future but i know i know there's not a river long enough that does not contain a bend but i believe right now i would not slaughter a woman and maybe it's just vanity talking you know the scriptures say that man is mostly vanity but uh um in my vanity i do not believe i would do it you know but if i did do it if i somehow snapped because who could who would never know i would plan it out i'd be very very careful about it you know but i would track the lady you know because because you know there's still a stigma even in today's enlightened society uh when you uh slaughter a lady so i would track the lady you understand i would find out this is what you gotta do you have to find out her her uh habits you know like maybe go hey man i know she goes to that cheese sandwich store every day and when she comes back she's got a big paper bag of stuff i bet you ain't there's cheese sandwiches in there eh so you put that up in your head lady likes cheese sandwiches it's one piece of information but you take your time you know then you notice you see another pattern you hey every wednesday night that lady goes down to the gymnasium and plays basketball with other ladies which is fine nowadays so what i would do is i would stand outside of the gym you know and she'd come out there all sweaty with a ridiculously tri-colored ball you know and uh and she'd be finished her game and then where would i be i'd be standing at the other side of the parking lot and in my hand what do you think would be resting but a cheese sandwich right so then she'd go hey what's in your hand i go what nothing she go yeah there's something in your hand i go no none of my hand i don't know what you're talking about she'd go there send me your hand i'm not blind i see something in your hand i go there's nothing in my oh yeah this oh no it's just a chief saying what why you like him or something i got a whole bunch in that van over there yeah that craziest looking van you've ever seen in your life it's right over there and by the way if you ever do this and i don't think you ever should you you don't have to have cheese sandwiches in the van you know unless you're proud of your detailed work or something like that don't want you to go if you're a frugal serial killer i'm the last that would advise you to throw away all kinds of money on uh on cheese and double the amount on bread you know should bread and cheese cost the exact same amount of money but anyways i would plan it out that's my that's what i'm saying and then i would take the lady in the and i would never do this of course but i would take the lady in the van to a remote area you know where there was a wooden shack that i had constructed and uh and uh it was silenced to the point that her screams would just echo off the walls never to reach civilized ear again and then i would do whatever it is that they do that gives you that god-like power and then i would take her to the woods and i would bury her in the deepest grave ever that would be most of my plan the grave like two years before i had selected a victim i would be working on the grave i'd get 50 100 foot grave as a matter of fact if i had any sense in my head as my dad used to say about me i would start digging the grave now just in case because you never know when you're going to snap you know i should go home and just take a big deep hundred foot grave yeah and worst case scenario like my dad used to say hey a little a little hard work never hurt anybody god damn it and best case scenario i uh you know slaughter a lady and get him out if you're gonna if you're gonna slaughter a lady and i'm completely against it it's much better to slaughter a lady and get away with it and slaughter a lady and not get away with it that's just i don't know because i've not i've not done either you know i would have to talk to one of you that have done both to really get an answer but i would i would suspect like anything not getting caught you know is is the better choice than getting caught you know it's funny you know the things we think we're afraid of you know because uh the things we're really afraid of in life like monsters you know and uh serial killers and uh terrorists and stuff like that hey they ain't gonna do nothing you know like what's the chances really you know i mean but you're always afraid like earthquake or something like that you know tsunami i was afraid that's crazy stuff but you're not the stuff that really gets it you're not afraid of you don't even think about it you know like you think you're always like man i hope a terrorist doesn't attack and kill me right what's the chance of that happening like one in a billion you know a terrorist ain't gonna attack and kill you you know but what's the chance that you're going to be attacked and killed by your own heart at a 100 percent yeah nobody even thinks about that nobody cares about that your heart can attack and kill you and yet people like their hearts you know they give you for valentine's oh a heart whoo people go man that guy's got a big heart i go you better  watch out on account i could kill him does he know that that it will attack and kill him would he's not expecting it at all that's what happened to my dad his heart attacked and killed him it was tough i don't know if you ever loved anybody but when you love somebody and then their heart attacks and kills them man it makes you sad and my dad i love more than anybody and he never saw it coming you know he never he thought his heart was on his own side he was looking around for terrorists  like that and uh and it was just one time boom his heart got him he's lying in his bed and boom by the time he hit the floor they say he's dead and i saw him as the second guy after my mom to see him and i was oh blood it was black that would be red and he was lying there and i was so sad it was the most saddest moment ever and um it was too late he was dead already you know and uh and then the people came in the white they wear white they're not doctors but they wear white and it was too late and they just try to make you feel better you know i just say anything you know like one guy was like don't worry norm he uh he never felt a thing he died in his sleep and i was like really when his heart attacked and killed him but because i wake up if my cat walks across my belly so i i don't my dad was that sound to sleeper another guy said don't worry norm he's in a better place i say he's on a floor dead earlier he was alive on the bed with the tempur-pedic pillar i got him for christmas i'm not a doctor but i think that's the worst place but it doesn't matter it doesn't matter because i have my uh i have my faith so as long as i have my faith you know i'm all right as long as you have faith if you don't have faith forget it you're through but uh yeah you can have other things i guess you guys drink booze if you don't have faith like i have faith you know i have deep faith but if i did i think i'd go for booze because uh seems like you know seems like a good thing my buddy everybody has diseases my buddy has alcoholism which is a disease and he told me that he said norm i got a disease of alcoholism you know it's taken over my life and it is a disease you know but i was trying to look on the bright side of things and i told him i said listen bobby his name is bobby i said you know it's true you got a disease and everything you know but you got to look at the bright side because that's what i believe in and as far as diseases go i think he got the best one i told him it's the only disease where you get to drink a lot of booze all the time as a matter of fact that is the disease just drinking booze it's not exactly bowel cancer you know like my my uncle basil he has bowel cancer i would not and i don't think my buddy bobby the alcoholic would ever go to my uncle basically hey i hear you got bowel cancer i know how you feel man i drink booze those diseases good lord what are your symptoms my bowel hurts a lot and i bleed from the bowel how about you i get happy and sometimes i get i meet i go somewhere i meet someone that has the same disease as me and then i have sex with them that night that's in the latter stages of the disease but listen man i'm just an old chunk of coal you know i could be a diamond someday don't worry about it it'll happen through the through the grace of god you know you guys like god i mean you do god's work you know even if you don't know it i uh i have always been very religious you know um but i'm a specific religion i don't want to tell you what religion you know because i don't know if my religion is the exact correct one even though i know there's a god for sure i'm not a hundred percent sure that my guy is the right guy actually that's one of my biggest fears is after i die i get up to heaven i'm like oh god not you i i thought it was the other fella what oh god what a he was a good public speaker you got to admit that not him at all no oh well how about that so what now i got to get raped by the devil forever or something so that's my worst fear you know because i try to you know i try to do good and i try to even though i'm an old chunk of coal i want to be a diamond someday you know i want to be the world's best friend you know go around shaking everybody's hand you know what man won't be a good guy but uh maybe god through uh through even an old wretch like me can do something but uh you guys do things for children what's better than children you know what i mean i have a child a child i do i still have one he's like 10 15 something like that time goes by so quickly you know you can't it's hard to remember details no but he's a he's beautiful when you have a child man you got a love that's unbelievable you know you never had it before you realize you've never had it once you have it you know like when you have a child you go oh my god what the hell is that you know like you i know you used the word love before and everything like that but you're like whoa that is something and then your single friends they don't understand you go hey jim man you gotta get one of these this is the craziest feeling i ever had i got just all through my body all i feel is like happy and then the guy goes is it like crystal meth and you go no what i don't want to be your friend anymore friend no this this is love this so this is love and then actually sometimes you have a this is the the flip side of it the bad moment because you ever look you said earlier that you loved other things before you saw this you know which is what you really love and so there's always a bad moment when you're looking at that and then you look over at your wife you ever do that you're like oh look at this i love that's love oh hey there lady what's going on there yes this is it and it makes sense you know because it's pure and it hasn't doesn't lie and it's you and it's your blood and your dna and your aunt hazel's the nose part right there and everything and so how can that compete to some lady that you met in a bar one night how could that possibly compete with that so anyways ah the children i love children it's funny like you can't love children anymore because you know even though jesus and i'll tell you something i don't want to say any specific religion is better than all the false ones but this is the only religion i'll tell you that i am against the church of satan any  knows that's not the right one i think even satan himself admits him anyway um uh you know so jesus was that's one that's one of the only i think it's the only religion that puts children at the core you know of uh their religion you know they love children so um so that's good because i love children but when i when my child was young that was always worry i was worried i was worried you know i remember when he was really young and uh i was worried about everything i remember one time like he was only four days old or something i was watching tv and they did a news story he said coming up a news story on crib death and then i was like that's where my kid sleeps you would think crib death would put a crimp in the sails of cribs if not wipe out the entire industry that's what i would think yeah a couple of toyotas go skidding around all of a sudden they can't sell cars but the crib industry incredibly resilient actually kills children what if it's one of its defects i'm calling for for a full recall of all all the cribs that have killed the children oh man i'm thirsty  so yeah yeah so i'd probably drink if i if i wasn't a person of faith you know i'd probably drink a lot of booze and stuff like that that'd be fun yeah do something you know and uh yeah i don't like drinking though you ever drink those those little shooters that are really like powerful and they have like sex names they have like filthy names you know what i'm talking about so that we could all have like sex on the beach you know what i mean and so i don't know why they name them like that i guess because people are drunk and they're like hey maybe if i drink that that will happen to me but uh of course if you have a night of drinking you're not gonna end up having sex on the beach that's never happened and the history of recorded time you know but you know you're not going to have a shooter bar where you go up and uh yeah excuse me can i have a hump and a dude i figured was a lady i swear to god i thought he was a lady and uh also my friend will have a senseless knife fight you know one of them given one of them but uh you know what i don't like drinking i don't like drinking because i like i i can't drink i go on the road so often you know because i'm a stand-up comic and uh i'm also i'm also a dangerous drifter so my my hobby and my work dovetail very nicely i drift from tan to town across this great nation you know and i do some stand-up comedy so i'll be in a town and the you know the policeman feller will say hell i'm in for he'll he won't know that i do stand up he just knows me as a drifter because i see her in town huh i go yeah yeah he goes how long you going to be here i go just till monday yeah i work down there i got a job see i got a job well you can ask vic i'll be asking vic and i want you out of here monday morning the time you say you're going to be out of here i will sir i will and off i go but uh but what i was gonna say was that you know as i travel this great nation you know you know what i would like to do actually is if there is a great depression is that coming by the way because you guys seem to know more than me like um will there be a great depression like like will i be carrying around at some point a stick with a thing on the back of it and will i be like will i be hanging around big big garbage cans with fires and making hot dogs with them and sharing them with my friends and ganging together you know we got a gang together in case the other gangs get us yeah i don't know keep saying things on the news got to prepare myself what about those things you see on the commercials where you go i think everything's like  now because uh something's happening weird you know like you receive where they'll go like uh you have a guy in the commercial and he goes uh he goes hey you like gold yeah you ever think of getting gold keeping it it's worth a lot of money and you go yes of course i thought of that ever since i was five daffy duck i first thought of it when i watched daffy duck when i was five ah well you should get gold i'm g gordon liddy and i broke into the watergate hotel you like gold don't even know why the guys what about guys that oh forget it i was gonna say guys that do commercials where they're you know when guys are old and they do commercials and you kind of feel sorry for them you know because they're old like remember the six million dollar man right the guy was worth six million dollars no he's an actor but he played the six million dollar man so when he got this he goes hey man what's the role gonna be you're gonna be a guy worth six million dollars say your arms are the best arms and your eyes everything so he's feeling good about himself you know he's like yeah that's pretty cool yeah because a regular man is not worth six million dollars you'd be surprised to know this but an actual regular person if you just trick them down to their trace elements you know what a human body's worth it's only worth like a couple hundred thousand dollars so but this guy was worth six million dollars so now anyway i've seen him on the commercial he sells the bionic ear so this is kind of sad to me you know that he was at one time you know uh hollywood six million dollars man and now he's like i don't hear too good you want to buy this the bionic year and of course you get  because you think of the bionic year from the show or and you could hear from a long way away you know how you could tell the bionic man was fast by the way this is kind of a neat trick they did that seems very counterintuitive but at the start of the bionic man they'd show a collage of how powerful he was to show how fast he ran they would show him running in slow motion so you'd be like this that and you go god damn that guy's fast man i wish i could run that fast how does he run that i always feel sorry for those guys that i have to do that what about those guys that have to do they get so old they do those commercials for for old guys that can't get insurance and stuff that's a bad job ed mcmahon had it for a while then he died you know after that job general you die but because they pick an actor that's going to die soon so he can relate to that but so now it's alex trevegarson but it's always like and and and they're trying to get old people really old people to get insurance that it appears they shouldn't be entitled to and so it's always like hey if you've never been accepted once everybody decline you because you're so close to death anyways we want you we don't know why but it's uh cost two dollars a year and uh we don't make a lot of money i'll be honest with you my father started the business and he was worth six billion dollars six years ago and he blew it out with this ridiculous venture anyways so listen guys and uh in honor of the children you know because hey the children are our future and i believe that i don't really believe that because they told me that when i was a kid and it didn't work out but i will tell you uh i will tell you a joke that a kid told me in a sick kid's hospital he told me this joke and he promised me to tell you and he's going to see his savior before i mine probably who knows but his joke is this this is a joke he goes uh it's a funny joke and then i'll leave you but you guys have been great thank you so much so here's the joke the joke is this that a dog walks into a telegram office western union i'm supposedly and uh he didn't know and uh he said uh and and so the telegram guy goes hey what kind of what do you want me right now telegram so the dog goes woof woof so the guy writes it down you see and he says the dog is hey doc i can't help but notice here there's only nine words on your telegram you know 10 words or less it's the same price if you would like i could add an extra woof you know and then the dog goes but that wouldn't make any sense why would i most of his brain stem was gone he wasn't making a lot of sense but he was a child they said he was more host than virus i don't even know what that means i'm not a doctor but no such child exists all children are all children are all children are beautiful except the evil ones i like all children except british children i don't like those british children because they remind me of the devil  they're very evil and you know i grew up with the omen and stuff like that and uh you know when the omen was uh young damian you know is all scary and everything yeah and uh then later they did omen two and he's a little old he was still frightening and then he was like 13 and the third one he was frightening and they did one he was an adult he wasn't frightening enough it's interesting huh you would think that that you know human beings would become more evil as time went on you know you wouldn't think that the embodiment of evil would be inside of a child but you know i think that's hey that's just the uh the celluloid pictures we get you know i think in reality you know uh as uh as the scriptures say let the children lead us you know so um let me think if i can think of a joke though it seems fair geez i don't know a lot of jokes oh i know joe there was a guy who had a great pig man this guy had the greatest pig in the world and so a guy come to his house he said man i hear you got the greatest pig in the world so the farmer goes are you kidding are you talking about bill the guy goes i don't know man i just heard he was a pig i didn't know his name he goes yeah his name is bill bill the pig and uh this pig man he's the best he goes why do you say that how come you say it i got any examples because i got examples he goes last summer man he goes the our child fell into the well you know and was in the well we didn't even know and the pig came running i was at the back 40 poem and the pig grunted and snorted and i came just got my son out just in time god bless that pig you know the pig had a wooden leg by the way i forgot to tell you that and uh so uh then he goes uh yeah that's interesting but he's got a wooden leg because let me tell you more about the pig he goes then another time he goes that pig saved my life man i was under the tractor and a pig with his own weight pushed up the tractor and hurt his spine he had disc issues later but he did it for me on account he loves me and he goes well but still he'll only got to one the wooden leg never mind that the guy says he says listen to my stories about the pig he goes this pig well you know last summer the big fire you heard about the big fire you never heard about it it was a big fire it was a big fire all down the rural route 20 here and it hit our house the worst anyways the wife and i are very sound sleepers and we didn't hear anything and if it weren't for the pig who hid his snout on the window outside of our bedroom hit it with such uh ferocity that it smashed the window open and we escaped you know the black the black smoke then we would not be alive today why why we we belong to this pig this pig we would not exist without it it's our most prized possession if you could even call it that we love that pig more than anything and so then the guy said but i still don't understand how comet's got a wooden leg and then the guy says are you kidding me man have you ever been listening to me you can't eat a great pig like that all at once you know you haven't heard a word i've said is wrong with you hey folks you've been great god bless keep up the good work and uh may god save your soul  you
Norm Macdonald,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmoc9knfudY,I know this grimness although my buddy I did want to say one thing about my buddy Richie who has a disease and uh but it's it's an interesting disease he has he has the disease of alcoholism alcoholism and he came to me you know and he told me and uh I like to look I'm a kind of guy who likes to look at the bright side of things you know so I told him I said Richie it's true that you have a disease and everything but I think you got the best one foreign disease where you get to drink booze all the time I haven't looked at every medical journal but I believe it's the only disease where you can constantly drink booze as a matter of fact that is the disease you know and I don't think Richie would think he'd had like I don't think Richie would go to my uncle Burt go hey I understand you got bowel cancer ah man I know how you feel like uh drink a lot of booze those diseases they're tough those diseases hey what's your symptoms uncle Bert well my bowel I got blood pouring out of it all the time I got battle blood pouring out gushing out of my bowel almost Non-Stop and uh I got searing climb pains ripping tearing you know mind screeching bowel pains and uh they're combined with aching dull Soul deadening battle thing those are basically my symptoms how about you I get happy and uh you know I tend to be able to talk to people easier I find sometimes I will meet a lady at a bar got the same disease as I do and I'll  her but uh oh that's in the latter stages of the disease pervert Yeah I realize that yeah I mean but uh no but listen man I don't minimize what he does though because he's he he you know he admits that he's a alcoholic and then he's weaker than above and that ain't easy to do I couldn't do any of that  I'm too proud you know what I mean I got too much pride you know like are they saying the scriptures Pride goeth before the fall you know and he could somehow you know it's a very uh beautiful thing he does he goes to Alcoholics Anonymous and he says right in front of them he says you know he goes in front of a whole room full of people and he says I am a alcoholic you know which I know does not sound that anonymous name the group that's like the exact opposite of anonymous whatever like to me the alcoholics that you know the anonymous alcoholics to me would be like you guys I don't  know I can't tell you know but once you tell a whole church basement full of people your covers pretty well blonde but uh anyways it still requires a lot of people yeah they seem to be anonymous about from the way I can gather it is they won't tell you their last names anything else goes you know but uh not the last name I don't know sometimes they'll say the first like they'll go I am Richie and I am the alcoholic or the first initial they'll say hi my name is Richie K and I am an alcoholic then anything goes they're like ah one time I uh I remember I was under the influence of the demon rum and uh my God I started uh punching my newborn in the face yes I looked out of my fish and it was all bloody with uh I don't know what it was it was either from my Knuckles or my son's skull yeah I'm not telling you my last name thanks Rex as far as I'm concerned a man should have a little you know never tell you about the time I blew a dog for a pint of gin oh yeah I did tell you first initials k I'll give you that much but she came but I'm not gonna say the last letters plus you can memorize my face but other than that I would like to keep this completely Anonymous if there's just a way I could and what better way to keep a secret when you think about it than tell a room full of drunks that's not going anyplace you know as soon as the guys are relapsed hey Richie blew a dog for a pint of gin he told a whole bunch of us all right I mean I understand that I get some Gin what are you gonna do GK you know where chica but I don't drink myself you know it's not because I'm no big guy I'm just afraid you know I fear everything you know and uh so I I'm afraid to and stuff but um I used to now I don't drink and when you're with people that drink it doesn't it doesn't work out that's why that designated driver thing I don't think every word that I see ads for it again like I think they're trying to resurrect that idea but it's kind of a flawed notion you know say hey Bill listen we were wondering if you'd come out with us here's the idea we want to go out and drink and then we were over here come with us and not drink how does that sound to you we're going to go to a bunch of different bars and drink and then you come with us and not drink also we're not going to be driving you're gonna pick us up at our different houses go to a bunch of bars not drink while we drink and then drive us all home how's that sound to you that's that's that ketchup you guys like I don't know what's the catch it sounds too good there's some sort of but I don't drink and if you don't drink I'll tell you something bars are not a lot of fun because you know when you think about it  hot you know all it is is you're just sitting at a big oak table for four hours that's not fun unless you're drunk and then everybody else be drinking you know I mean so their fun is going up and up and up you know it's rising their fun is escalating while you're fun is staying exactly the same and then by the end of the night you don't even know what the  they're laughing about just everybody's laughing and then they start resenting you for it I've seen that man uh drunk people do not want a not drunk guy there I know that I've been there so many times it always ends the same guy comes up he goes hey what's the matter with you thank you cheer up  then you're like oh no I'm having a good time too don't take a wild swing at me when I'm not looking driving you home later it's a lot of fun

Norm Macdonald,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsqmhrxYFAw,"yeah how's the family how's everything going oh great man couldn't be better life is uh is fantastic yeah I like life man you do really oh my God people complain about it first of all you're lucky you're lucky enough to be alive when you think about it you know what I'm saying your mother had to have sex with your father that your grandparents had to have sex Grand great grandparents had to have sex it's lucky you're alive my God it's amazing and I'm so happy every day I'm alive because it's just a fluke there's so many many more people that never got to be alive yeah and uh that's an interesting point I guess you're right if you do the math so when people care up about it I'm like man it's the greatest gig in the world being live you get to you get to eat a Denny wear a hat whatever you want to yeah get haircuts It is Well good I'm glad life is going well I know now um you know I I've never asked you this before and we've been good friends for many years okay I made that up but uh we haven't no no we're friends we're good friends but I don't know what you're I'm McDonald is that Irish is that Scottish what's your ethnic background my ethnic background is Polish are you really polish Pol people I didn't realize that McDonald you don't well my my parents changed their names they had to because the constant ribbing they'd get for being polish you know and uh so they changed their name to McDonald but uh you know it's one of the things that you can you know I mean I get a little upset about it you know because you know poish jokes yeah you can't make jokes about other people but for some reason you make jokes about Polish people you know right I don't like it right you shouldn't that sounds bad yeah I mean I had an experience you know I go in and and I order a Polish sausage you know from this guy you know and uh so the guy says to me oh oh you must be polish and I said come on man I mean come on think about it what you're saying you know I'm trying to I'm trying to knock some sense into this Fell's head maybe give him a a wider world view you know sure yeah yeah I said you think because I order a Polish sausage I'm polish I I said what if somebody came in here and ordered French toast would you would you think he was French you know right what if somebody came in here in order to why why a Belgian waffle would you consider that guy a Belgian you know I mean I mean I mean if if a guy came in and ordered to uh German BR worst would you would you consider that fell to be a a German fella right I said what if a guy came in and ordered German potato salad I suppose you'd think he was German too yeah yeah yeah you what if a guy I said what if a guy wow you talk to this guy for a while I'm telling you man with with racist you have to get through you have to really get it into their head right I said if a guy came in he ordered a Cuban hamburger you're going to assume he is a Cuban right right right I said I think it is absolutely ridiculous that just because I come in I order a Polish sausage why would you jump to the fact that I'm polish right and the guy says to me well first of all it's a hardware store and you hate polish jokes don't you you just hate them no I think they're disgusting let me ask you quickly uh we haven't talked to you in so long I want to ask you about your family uh my great family I love them all how's your we used to talk in the old days you and I used to used to spend some Yarns about Uncle Hector how's Uncle Hector Uncle Hector Uncle Hector he's polish too I'm guessing no he wasn't polish no he was from my cousin's side of the family and he was uh he was a he was a great man my uncle you know uh he uh was an old fella he he actually uh uh rode the rails during the Depression oh you know he's a hobo hobo as you might call him I don't like that term whatever or whatever what have you railroad bum and uh but he wasn't a bum he was just out he was a good honest man during the Depression searching for work you know and you know he had no money so he'd travel the country trying to find work and he actually rode the rails Uncle Hector and uh and he told me I was interesting story he'd go through this is in Canada and there's a town called kitner in Canada and the railroad cops were tough boy they were tougher tougher than the real cops you know they had a lot of their own the railroad cops I feel like they should be tucked into bed listening to you anyway a law of their own those railroad cops but there was not a Railroad Cop tougher than kitner Lesley oh boy he was well known he was well known for beating hobos to death really he find a hobo on his train he beat him to death beat him to death and uh so what the uh the railroad bums would all do is as Kitchener approached of course oh hey hey nor how so U wow such focus on these stories that wasn't a mirror that was was a guy named yeah so uh uh uh the railroad bums would all see hop off before they got to kiter to avoid being beaten to death by Kitchener Lesley yeah anyways my uh my uncle Hector a good man you know and he he walked into a mine one day this is a a story for the that they think the young people could learn from he this is yeah don't go mine hopping kids dur during the height of the depression where there was absolutely no work my uncle Hector walked into to I won't say the name of the mining company it was McIntyre mine and he and he walked in he had his he had his lunchbox with him and his his his work boots and he said sir he said uh I want a job they said we have no jobs he said well five 00 people work here at McIntyre mine he goes uh I don't think there are 500 men here better than I uh he says as a matter of fact I don't think they're 200 men better than I he says I I think you'd be strapped to find 100 men better than I and by golly he got the job what do you think that's a great story now I'm sensing there's more now back to Kitchener lesle the most dreaded no no no Uncle Hector Uncle Hector what no I'm trying to help out no Uncle Hector dad where's this story going Uncle Uncle Hector worked in a mine and it's a it's a hellish job to mine as you well know and you know Darkness you know it's dank it's dank yeah it's it's coaly it's a lot of what well you're in a coal M it's not coaly it's coal ridden coal infested it's not coaly it's coal infested so uh so he worked in the mine and by God he worked hard and uh after a week of working hard he said to the the shift manager he said where he said bye golly I'd like to have a lady I work hard and uh where would I find a where would I find a lady here in town well they said to Uncle Hector they says uh uh we don't have uh we have sex with animals here my God says Uncle Hector I'm not going to do that I why I'm a a normal fellow well then then uh be to your own devices then so be to your own devices wow Uncle Hector continued working in the mind he worked hard and he worked long and he worked for a low wage but he was a man and uh and Uncle Hector after a couple of weeks passed he started to get a little itch you know as as you and I say you know right right well when we're thinking about the the ladies Ladi and but he kept it under control he went again he said are you sure there's no ladies here no we have sex with animals oh my God six months passed and Uncle Hector couldn't take it any longer he told me he said by God I just had to I'm just a man I'm weak you know I'm I'm not a saint you know and I I was I was born in sin I suppose and I I couldn't resist I just needed it so so he said he walked by a pastor and there there was a pig oh God that's terrible it's terrible and uh so uncle Hector said well he he he said I walked up and I I began having sex with a pig and he said uh all of a sudden he saw all the miners like around him you know looking at him they go Uncle Hector what the hell are you doing over there and Uncle Hector's like indignant he's like what you you're the guys that told me that uh that you have sex with animals they're like Uncle Hector you damn fool that's kitner Lesley's girlfriend of all the animal all the animals to have sex with you don't want to have sex with get your Lesley's Pig no that's terrible not kitchen or Lesley's Pig kitchen or lesli's lady oh yeah you tell quite a yarn man well I had shorter ones but there's no other guest tonight that pretty much I have one other funny anecdote and it's it's very short I don't think we can here is the always entertaining Norm McDonald Ladi and gentlemen    yeah I saw that show today Norm very funny what show the TV show yeah your TV show yeah congratulations and by the way you look very uh youthful and how come we haven't seen you in two years oh how how come I haven't been here in two years yeah oh man I've been busy I got a kid you know I know how old well you got a kid yeah I do how old is Harry he's uh seven Yeah man they they grow up so slow you know don't it's barely discernable isn't it yes how old is your son he's 18 they get far less cute yeah they're not not as cute when they're out on the lawn punching you in the chest yeah well anyway it's good to have you here oh it's good to be here man and uh in addition to the new show the Norman McDonald sport show you have you have like your was it your first stand up special yes I did a Comedy Central special uh one of 40 they did this year on Comedy Central and uh but it was fun but uh I got a weird time U they showed it at 11:30 and on Saturday and it turned out that that was during this thing called Earth hour I think some people know what it is on Earth hour you have to turn off your electricity so wow that's horrible and as you know and as I know and as they apparently know TVs are powered by electricity so um and furthermore my key demographic is damn dirty hippies  yeah oh man well you know what are you going to do took one on the chin there yeah yeah now listen uh I'm very surprised and impressed about this that you you you've built kind of like a a Twitter following yes well I'm an internet sensation whoa now I didn't take you for a guy that would know about that kind of stuff I know all about that stuff really when when did when did you start twittering two weeks ago really but this is what I know I did it for the Oscars the guy told me how to do it and I was watching the Oscars and you know how horrible those were and uh so it was pretty easy to do just jokes constantly on how horrible everyone was you know and uh and uh you know and some of the things were nice like uh it was nice to see Kirk Douglas of course you know and he had that terrible stroke which didn't affect his comic timing at all and uh but uh so I twittered and I I ended up twittering 190 tweets whoa and which is it turns out it's way too much really so people started telling me to stop anyways get this just earlier this happened right before we came on the uh on the show I walked out here uh I'm in some kind of Twitter feud with Steve Martin I know that I know that Steve also actively twitters yeah yeah so this is what happened dig this you know how to tweet no you don't know how to tweet no where you been so so uh so I write he writes a tweet I misunderstand it I reply hear what he says what he said okay well this is what he said I'm not really that great at it but he said uh he said has anybody seen my hat now um I'm looked every for for it I can't find my hat right so I say was it a brown Fedora with a red hatband but what I didn't know is he sent a twit pick stop right there let me just say if this is example of Twitter communication it's  invaluable what do you think I should answer him this is the last thing you said to me he goes uh this just came in nine seconds ago he goes still mulling over this tweet from Norm to me it's so enigmatic is it a put down I I don't honestly I I mean he lost a hat right yeah and then you responded is it with a red hatband yeah I don't none of this makes any sense it's a generational thing oh I guess so well what is it I will tell you what's cool about the the internet and being an internet sensation and stuff on the YouTube now everybody you know uh uh I don't know if you remember but but the F and did you ever hear the Andy Williams quote in the future everybody will be famous for 25 minutes yes I think it was Andy Warhol Andy Williams was Moon River oh any a generational yeah okay but here's the thing uh uh like for instance have you ever heard of Harrison Schmidt no okay he walked on the moon I didn't know that right an astronaut a guy who walked on the moon there's very few people that have been in the position to go Hey where's the moon there it is right well you're right that's a good point right now so 12 people have landed on the Moon Neil Armstrong Buzz Aldren who else right so this Harrison Schmid fell must be going what the hell do I have to do to get famous yeah right  meanwhile the Kardashians we know Chloe we know it's awful yeah Lois Lois Kardashian all of them we'll be right back with Norman McDonald everybody     I don't know you can tweet tweet Steve Martin can you tweet him right now I can tweet him or just tell him that I said hi oh okay yeah and that you're on the show and we're talking about him awes I said I said hi awes and oh add this I'm sorry about the  Hat you know it's great also while I do this I'll tell you this the great thing about about the blogosphere mhm now the great thing is this that uh that you uh you have friends you see what I mean yeah now on the computer I have about 160,000 friends oh in real life I have two but um I actually like my uh uh I like my friends on the uh the blogosphere here

an name come out we're going to be pop KN uh by the way you are the first guest to sit in our new couch talk to me about uh this is some couch I'll tell you that man what do you think I it that's the highest compliment you can pay a couch it is it is is a high compliment it's just we have a minivan of nuns that is uh have you uh uh ever felt a couch that you felt that way before before this couch uh no this is the first one man I I'm a normal fella you know uhhuh do you think it's the ultra suede it may be it may be the uh it has a a luring come hither look it has a bit of a nice slant to it I believe it's a goddamn let's be honest it's a nice couch it's a nice couch I don't to dispar the now we're talking backstage you mentioned Arnold what were you saying oh I was just telling that I I love Arnold Schwarzenegger you love Arnold Schwarz he I can already see him turn the state around and I thought it was very unfair when people uh said that he uh he wasn't qualified for the office you know because they said you know because he's a movie star uh you know an action hero you know that that shouldn't uh qualify him to be governor of California but what they don't remember is and I maybe I'm wrong with this but wasn't he at one point in his life Mr Universe that's right well yeah yeah you you bring up a cogent point I mean this is this is a tiny State on a on a globe in the Milky Way right right just to yeah you see the big picture exactly yeah ridiculous you know you're a smart F you should think about running for office with that well I I I I do feel that one day uh I I might do that I in all humility I think that I might have some ideas you know but uh you know I'm not I'm not ready yet I think you have to prepare for these things so I started uh I started weightlifting you're working out on you look uh you look good I guess yeah I got my abs yeah are those abs are they supposed to stick out like that I thought the ABS went in I didn't really so you're ABS so powerful they're actually coming forward wow that's amazing and they're hairy yeah hairy ABS yeah I don't want to see it but I don't even know what I'm supposed to do when I get the ABS really you just show them to people I I don't did you injure yourself did you you know I worked out man I went to this trainer uh he was a personal trainer and this guy man I don't know if you've ever lifted weights you look like you have you know yeah but uh no he looks like a strong guy but uh I was I went there I've never lifted weights you know and I was new to it and so the idea is you take the weight you're like and you lift it up and then then you put it down right yeah and then right away it lift it again and you put it down you do this 20 times and then the weight's where it was when it started you know and then uh so don't really gain anything you gain the weight is the same place and your muscles hurt you're all sore and everything and uh very repetitious you know it's uh it's the same problem I have with sex I know it's too uh too much of the same too much of the same yeah you can't get into it and uh so then so then the uh this character my trainer finally after two weeks of like lifting these crazy amounts of weights I go gez I I I think I finally uh it's getting a little easier he goes I'll put more weight on it what then like it's the same thing again just a never ending cycle I know did you heard you s sex if you finally figure that out it's not like they bring a heavier lady in I guess that's true got a bigger girl I let go take a break more with more right after this BR it a heavier he anchors the weekend update on Saturday Night Live and he has recently quit the nasty habit of smoking Norm McDonald nor  all  right you're now uh you're a young iconic class Norm you know the kids they get you what I was going to wear a suit and I I I I don't need I like this old DB Cooper look for you man this is now is he the guy jumped out of the plane no no he's married Dallas Cooper now the thing I'm uh you remember you wrote for my first talk show yeah you gave me my first I used to come in the room and you and Drake saor had no lights on it was like some  Anton La Satan cult in there and you guys used to turn out the sickest jokes ever and everybody was always smoking then I see you on Saturday Night Live during the opening credits and one of the things I like about you is you're completely unfiltered on that show you'll say anything and I saw in the picture you had a cigarette in your mouth I thought this guy just doesn't give a so I asked you to come on I find out you pussed out on me and quit smoking what is that all about no because it's bad for you they have these things on the side you have to read the fine print where it says it's bad now when did you first start smoking I started smoking as was a kid like when I was uh I I was like 14 and I thought I'll look really cool like I started smoking cuz I didn't get along with anybody so I started smoking wouldn't you know it I did look cool all of a sudden all these broads like me and everything not broads but ladies girls women and uh it was hard though man because I was I was guilty about all the time I smoked CU I always thought you know that's I always knew it was bad for me you know like even though some you know some guys will say that it's good because their Uncle lived long or something he smoked you know they'll go hey what about you know that old guy uh you know Bert must what about that guy you know and then uh uh uh he just cuz he lived long that doesn't mean anything right that's just one guy you can't just cuz Bert must lived long you're all of a sudden you did your Master's thesis on this didn't you I never now that people bother you a lot when you're smoking were people pissed off when yeah people don't like when you smoke you know they they're bothered like I got to admit though secondhand smoke is bad like I don't like when I smoked I didn't like secondhand smoke you know I like that firsthand smoke cuz you get to suck it right out of the cigarette you know and the second hand any any thing that's already been ingested by someone is not as good you know you know what I mean I I like a pork sandwich is delicious but after a digested pork sandwich that's you know you can't fight that logic n you cannot do you think advertising brings kids to smoking you know they a lot of fight with the Joe Camel thing do you think they really yeah they got no yeah definitely they got it because the thing is this the advertisers they got to go after kids because they're not going to get adults like there's not going to be a 50-year-old guy going hey should start smoking like goddamn camel look at them they got to get little children Jo C yeah that's a frightening looking Beast he looks like a I I didn't make this up and I know you don't mind firsthand but uh you don't know that don't say that I know how this stuff happen man cuz a buddy of mine worked on Saturday Night Live and he said he was a once as a joke then he said everybody comes up to and saying are you a  gay man gay man I mean show about smoking they thought you meant the British word for cigarette all right uh exactly can I bum a that's what they say in England where else all right uh I think about Joe Camel looking like a Dennis oh yeah I lost my train of thought thanks for bringing me back is this this is what I've noticed he look he doesn't even look like a camel he looks so much like a because you know how it's usually subliminal where you have to find the  right this character you have to find the goddamn camel yeah believe me when you only get two humps out of a it's not worth smoking all right now line two we' got a phone call for you although I can't believe they'd still be on the line after this departure uh line two we've got Beverly from Middletown Ohio Beverly yeah hi Dennis hi Norm hi you didn't know my name I don't think yes I did I watch Saturday night do you like it yeah I liked it when Dennis was on it yeah I did too I watch Dennis get out of here you're great at that man you're great at Denis you know why because you don't give a about Dennis you know what I mean it's like the best thing you can do whenever I'd go on they'd go what's it like following Chevy and I like Chevy he makes me laugh what the  do I think about Chevy I'm trying to make a living here you know what I mean when I see you I know you're thinking the same thing like screw Dennis I'm killing okay uh anyway go ahead what's your question okay since nicotine is such an addictive drug do you think someday you'll have to have a prescription to buy a pack of cigarettes well you know they always bring up the Constitution and talk about how we should still have the right to a militia and all that let's face facts this country was built on Tobacco Growers so you know if you're going to start changing if you're not going to change one thing because it's comes from way back then you can't change this either there are farmers out there who make a living tobacco is one of the crops that got this this country going so no I don't think they'll ever make it illegal yeah no they shouldn't make it illegal I know I know I think Norm's backing me up on that what made it what motivated you to quit um well I guess you know I guess I was just I I read this thing about how uh it was like a fa phallic symbol and that my doctor went in I said he said you probably have an oral fixation which you know what that means let's not kid ourselves right so uh that's why I always smoke like cigarettes instead of cigars because if I'm going to have a I like a little white thin C you know back to again I go away to Ohio Middletown the center of the universe to take a nice clean call and then I space out I'm thinking I can't listen to Norm for a second I got to get a Time queue here I come back and you're might a thin white  in your I don't no I don't have a thin white in my you mean no in my mouth no no you misunderstand what I'm saying is this I'm just saying don't make the mistake of thinking I listen to you I just want to make it clear about that thing I was just saying if I ever was gay if they like suddenly made a mandatory or something then I would choose the smallest and i' would like a guy that came fast I don't know I thought the subject was Cox now Cox is next week I'm sorry does that answer your question yes it does La McDonald ladies and gentlemen good new luckily we have the good taste to bring tonight's guest back every season and he is as uncensored a wit as they come his new sitcom the norm show is on ABC Wednesdays at 9:30 please welcome George Went ladies and gentlemen it's there getting how you doing man how are you I'm all right how you going you're in you're out my favorite cast all right you're a good man cuz you have no uh no inner barometer of how far to go well no cuz it's HBO I I like to be dirty you know and it's fine you know what you are you're like a profane child that's why I think of you cuz you always I like to be dirty then you go up on this pinching us  R for like 3 minutes are ugly and Joe camell's a you're always shuffling your feet what are you nervous about you're a star for Christ sake how's that sitcom world is that hell or do you like that over there it's not a lot of fun but uh you know it's good to uh uh do no it's not oners hasm sent you a congratul your telegram or what word am I looking for though me I haven't heard any uh missive I think who's the old meire at your network uh as lady Jamie Tarsus she think you're funny yeah yeah yeah omire is not even there anymore isn't it wasn't one of his last official duties to whack you yeah he took off and they got this other guy I think it's maybe Sammy SAA Scott sassa Scott sassa all right now I'm going to do a roar shock thing what flashes into your mind when I say bad taste what do you find about this uh well there was this uh performance art guy I remember in New York that uh his his whole big thing was he'd take a picture of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ of Nazareth and then oh that's Jesus Christ yeah and then he his whole Act is he he'd piss on it with his  wow you know at least he showed respect he could have pissed with his what arm you're right you're right you're right so I thought that was really in horribly the line yeah because Jesus Christ you know he died for the guy's sin and then the guy pisses on his picture and it was a picture of Jesus dying for his sins like he was on the cross going oh I'm dying for the guy s and then this guy's like pissing all over it but you know when Judgment Day comes he's going to have to face Jesus Christ of Almighty of Nazareth you know and Jesus is going to say hey what's with the peing on my picture that negates every other good thing he ever did you know yeah he's like you don't piss on my picture yeah you don't want to come up to the Gates of Heaven Gods leaning there with a nunchuck strapped around his neck you know how do you go I'll have some performance there for you while the  devil shoves Some Coal up your ass as I said before the childlike outro but effective how do you define bad tastes is like beauty is it in the eye of the beholder or what yeah it's kind of is you know it depends on what people some people like get all upset over certain words like they think that that like girls all the time man when I'm talking to them like if I go hey uh uh how about you and I like you know and then and then the girl always goes like I don't I make love I make love and I go I don't whatever you want to call as long as my long as my dirty involved you know I don't care not going to get a not going to get in a semantic argument you know you can go making a grilled cheese sandwich as long as long as there's a lot of me doing now what's the earliest into a a hitting on a woman that you've ever said I want to you how do you give it a couple minutes right I try to get into it pretty quick you so that truck C on no you're in the gang I don't cuz I don't like uh I don't ever ask them if would you like to have dinner I don't really like having dinner with them or or having a drink with them or anything like that no you know so that's your sort of exchange with women is uh yeah I say hey how about you and me and then they go no and then they go how about we have dinner and I go I don't like dinner you don't like  so it's pretty basic thing you have kind a basic exchange I'm not good now Norm have you ever have you ever done anything in your long and stored career that you consider specifically to be in bad taste as you look back on it maybe at the time you thought it was a good play but you look back on it you think that was in bad taste well sometimes like in standup I'll do jokes that are uh that I like one time I was doing this thing in San Francisco and they were all gay people in the audience they told me so I figured I in San Francisco no so I figured I'd do stuff about gay people so that they could relate to it's warm up they love that and so I was talking about cuz I went to this gay pride parade and I saw in it there were these an old men and old ladies like with these signs that said we are proud of our gay son you know and so I was saying that's an odd thing to be proud of you know because it's not an achievement you know it's not like something you work all your life to be gay or anything like that and I I just wondered I just I I had a hard time believing that these 50 60 year old men are actually bragging you know at work like there hey Bill you know uh my kid oh my God we're proud of him Johnny he uh graduated from Harvard you know first in his class you know what I mean now he's articling over at a law for him and oh yeah he loves he can't get enough and his mouth is ass as K all C I got a I got a picture of the boy here sucking another man's I want to show to what do you do with your son um I play with him you do how old is he how old is this young man he's uh 15 years old 15 years old you're still playing with him right you know what the funny thing yeah when I was when he was a very young boy you know when he was like 3 four something like that I would play games with him you know like we play basketball or something sure and uh I'd let him win right you know and uh now he can beat me at everything and so he's like hey man I always beat you with everything I said no I used to let you win you go that's he doesn't believe it he always beat you yeah so he just thinks I'm some that can't beat a infant well it's be a bad one but just s it was all happened in Canada you know ah Canada you can't talk about it because it happened in Canada no I'm saying you know what happens in Canada stays in Canada but what but but seriously what what led to hey you want to hear a joke from my a yes I do he must have done something really bad no it's about that whatever happened in Vegas stays in Vegas go ahead yeah I want to hear you that  whatever happens in Vegas stays in Vegas I heard I heard so actually it do really stay like you can't it's not even kill a person and then leave Vegas and as everything's cool you know I mean so I what I did was I looked at that phrase what it actually means is basically you can go to Vegas  a prostitute and then she will not tell your wife right that's exactly exactly what they're saying you're saying not like those gossipy small town you're saying to where you come from I'm saying back at home they're they're blabber Mouse you're saying in other words they're sitting in the beauty partner going oh you're married to Hank Johnson I on his face last night in other words it's a small world there are certain people who L what did Gilbert did I read on the computer that Gilbert said something back at Affleck or something well I don't you know Gilbert is not the type to apologize for anything he says but I think it cost him a lot of money the Affleck gig was easy once a year he goes in acts like a duck and he makes a ton of D he doesn't even have to say anything but a you're right so you know he didn't know Affleck I guess has 75% of their business in Japan oh and they got a bit offended by what was going on so uh I did a I can ad I did an audition for it did you really did it seems like everyone is being auditioned what you do did you try to sound like Gilbert or did you try to change the they said uh they said uh I went I have only been on like five auditions in my life and every everyone's been a nightmare you don't you don't you don't strike me as an auditioning kind of guy the worst  ever so I go in and then the woman goes like I go I just thought I have to say afflac once right that's easy so she goes listen um create I want you to create a story like that's what I want you to do like you just think of the duck be quizzical and funny and then uh sarcastic and then serious and then sexy and she goes just create a story have fun they all say have fun with it no this is my work there's no fun here so then like three seconds in I'm like I want to get the out of here I ain't going to be the so uh she left and then there was just me and a guy with a hat so I said listen man let me just I'll just say afflac and get the out of here cuz uh you know I only got so many moments in my life right you got a Life to Live yeah so have you ever been in that situation you've never have been cuz you have complete freedom but it's me a guy with a hat he's telling me how to say a I'm saying affle I'm going I got a I don't have that many years left it dawned on you this is actual this like if if a doctor told you had 3 weeks to live you'd say God I'm spending too much time here exactly you go to psychiatrist do you go to psychiatrist I went for four times I could see you'd be difficult I I I started making up right and it was like bad did you feel not routines but I go I'd exaggerate things and then I go well no it wasn't that bad like you know so it was hard for you to take yourself seriously in therapy the first time I went was here in New York man I went to a apartment it was in an apartment is this during Saturday Night Live years yeah okay and uh like I was  uh addicted to gambling so that's why I went but anyways I go to this uh you're not addicted anymore than that you went and got cured I got oh yeah look at him he's cured he's only gambling $100,000 a hand now the lady so it's a lady it was a lady a lady psychiatrist attractive no no no God man such a seduct you know like the things at the bottom of the fish tank like that sucking fish yeah she look like that but she was a nice lady like a flounder and smart from the universities and right did someone recommend you someone from what La Michael say this somebody said go to this lady so I go in right and I never been in a psychiatrist so she starts asking me questions and uh I making little jokes and right everything she's asking so she says enough with the jokes what's that right jokes take it seriously what you know you're talking about your father and stuff and you're making jokes like say really what it is so I go I never did that in my life right so I'm like all right so then I'm talking so then cut to 25 minutes later chear streaming down my eyes I'm like a little  baby right I don't know if babies are I don't know but but I'm crying and right and then she's like okay time's up beat it so I'm like I'm like whoa I go no please go I'll pay you more just I have to stay here right and she's like there's another lady get out you know so I'm like so then I walk out and the cold New York you know with the hot dog vendors they don't give a about you tears and I go through Central Park shaking and here's the story about Rodney man he was uh guy kept doing coke and even when you know you get scared at some point you sto doing drugs most

stand up man that's all there is stand up and he meant it then there's a like five minute pause he's look at me right in the eyes he goes stand up he forgot it's all oh my okay a negative guy yeah time I went to uh uh you know this guy Milo schan yeah he's a big director so he he saw me on Saturday night life so he got the idea I was smart everybody always thought that I'm reading the news and like that come to her we go out no and right and so I go with them so it's me him and two guys from for two foreigners right and so these guys know everything you know and so they're like H what about uh the situation in the Balkans or something yeah you're the newsman so I'm just sitting there like a they know everything right they're concerned right so uh he thought and I just kind of play along like by repeating what they had said three sentences ago right and uh so anyways he goes I put you in the movie man I need the guy to and he was going to give me a big part right so I was like no no no don't do that like I can't act and he's like I don't have to worry about it I go seriously Milos I don't want you to give me a big part so he you what do you want I go just you know give me a small part that'd be cool so he made me a reporter right in this in this people versus Larry Flint right yeah I played one of the people right so originally you I think sounds like you were about to be Larry Flint right oh my God Dam Larry Flynn I have stories about that too but we uh so we uh go to we do the movie right and uh uh and I'm a reporter you know so he goes you know you drive up and get out of the car and run in I go well I can't drive he goes oh so he goes okay a cab will drive you so it doesn't make sense like a reporter is in a cab so I get to so we do the scene it's me and Larry Flint you know me and Woody harlson yeah so uh you know he has all these cameras he goes okay you know he goes you don't have to worry too much about the script just you know he's a really cool guy and uh he goes just whenever you're ready do it you know so then anyways Woody harlon's really cool and actors man when they're really good it's like something different you know and uh cuz I'm just I'm just waiting for the other to stop talking and I remember P attention no I'm just hoping to remember my words so anyways uh what's his name Woody harelson asked me if I want a beer you know mhm he goes you want a beer I go no that's cool I don't I don't drink you know he goes you don't want a beer I go no I don't drink but thanks man and then I go uh you drink like uh I thought you just smok weed and all that and then uh all of a sudden Mish former goes cut what the is going on like we were in the movie you didn't know know he talking to you cuz he was looking at me and talking like a a regular person there was nothing fake about it you got caught up in the movie he was such a good actor you said you'd rather um you'd rather uh play Frogger than have sex oh yeah well you have to know Frogger you know game it's an arcade game where a little frog has to go across the the river yeah and they have like a a little logs that he has to and sometimes the logs of crocodile and tries to eat them you're like totally into that yeah well I like a lot of things better than I don't care for sex now see that's the thing with me too cuz I'm totally Bor I I don't have any what's a m yeah it hasn't like uh gotten better over the centuy you know it's always the same thing it's very like I had sex when I was a young man and then I had it for a while and then I realized it's kind of always the same thing you know there's only a few things you can do you can go like this and then over you know what I mean you go I'll do this for a while and then do you think that we're being drugged by the government to lose interest in sex oh no I just think it's a it's a thing that like you know when people go hey you know that guy's a good he's good and dead you know and to me like how hard is it you know it's not like if you're good in badminton or something you know that's a hard thing badminton you got a and Frogger you know but uh sex you can figure it out in like 10 minutes you know yeah and like like goats do it and stuff you know like goats and pigs and stuff all do it so how how special can it be exactly show me a goat that can get past the third level of frog that's right that's right the the writers write it and then you say it so then if it's not funny the audience hates you you know right that's exactly why you have to be so mean to writers right right like the audience the audience is going to watch the Rosanne show and go oh that dirty Bruce rasm he's not funny at all they don't get that the writers don't get that it's your ass out there they go like no it is funny I'll be like I don't think it's funny well I wrote it and I say it's funny well then you go out there and say it they want like kind of they kind of want a robot that'll just say anything yeah but they're good people the writers you know I have to go back and talk to them after the show yeah remember when I used to make yall wear numbers yeah yeah yeah Rosanne made us all wearing numbers on our shirts so she wouldn't have to speak to us as human beings so you know she'd say hey just number nine and actually we have some writers on this show that was on that worked at rosan at ear yes so we have uh uh three and eight are they any good I remember those guys are they any good now oh yeah they're great they're great so yeah I know that uh the guy that used to write the uh what do you call it in Hustler magazine what he used to write the uh joked the captions under the comics in Hustler magazine where is he he he's the one that created your show he is he's the most talented yeah he's the most talented of all of them he also did Drew Carrey he's the most talented number I ever had on that show and I wish him the best he's Bruce Alford yeah three yeah he wrote the he started out at Hustler M yeah I didn't know that those things were hysterical he never told me that you mean like the really dirty cartoons with the blood and everything yeah yeah and then they have those captions they were funny yeah they're hilarious that one time I had a psychiatrist yeah like and uh CU they told me I should go see a psychiatrist I didn't want to go see one or anything like that but uh this uh so I go to see this dude the psychiatrist and uh I'm talking to the guy and I couldn't think of any problems or anything that I had you know I was just like yeah guy I'm working with kind of a troublemaker you know and the boss is always so I'm just like I had nothing to say the guy's like sitting there you know so then I go to the guy twice right and then I'm reading the paper the guy kills himself really yeah he killed himself and then and then I was reading his horrible life like he was on all these drugs and he was one of those guys that like to uh hang themselves there to have sex and all this weird stuff anyway oh my God yeah and then I just kept thinking good God like the last week of his life he was listening to my boring Pro you know he's all troubled and I'm going anyways a guy you know I don't think he respects me my boss you know that's kind of did did like that how How Deeply did that frighten you when you read it in the paper that he killed himself yeah I don't like hearing about guys killing themselves that's really scary isn't it yeah yeah especially a psychiatrist you figure they got it all going on in their head right yeah and then like when you find out they're crazier than you yeah I I don't like that cuz I also I don't like those psychiatrists too I'm always afraid like that uh you know they get you under their spell there and then you don't have anybody else you only trust the guy and then of course first thing he does has sex with you that's right yeah the first it's like a cult it's a horrifying cult I think same with hypnotist like I always think of a hypnotist is going to hypnotize you yeah he should say right before I promise I will not have sex with you you know while you're under because you know I want to give up smoking but at the same time I've got some pizza oh boy oh I love this pizza pizza very pizza oh my god look it it's kosher pizza it's so good too cuz you're Jewish that's right I just want to be able to eat pepperoni that's made out of ve or something I love that you'll go to hell what if I eat pepperoni with with pork yeah cuz you're Jewish well that make me go to hell yeah isn't that the whole idea go to hell no I'm Christian I can eat any kind of pizza and not go to hell I don't think I go to hell for eating it either oh you don't no I don't go to hell well they don't specifically mention Pizza in the Old Testament but it's uh but they do mention pepperoni yeah this pizza here it doesn't say you'll go to hell it just says you know and you know you don't you never know where you know you want might want to avoid this piece actually has Hooves on it you want to eat that and I said listen man cuz I kept hearing these things about how old people always have sex yeah so I say my grandmother you do you still grandfather you still have sex with my grandmother he was like good Lord no and then he was explaining it to me he's like cuz in his own head he thinks he's like a young dude yeah you know and so he says like when you get old it's not like all of a sudden your taste change where you go hey that wrinkly old lady looks good he told you that yeah wow he said that people still look good when they're in their 20s to like real old guys yeah yeah cuz he said whenever he looked in the mirror he was always shocked cuz he thought he was a like a dough boy back in the first world war you know he thought he was a handsome dude and uh even even if he did know he was ugly he still was not attracted to the old  bags nor McDonald is on the Adam Corolla show great to see you

I I got older and I was like God damn man I'm going to die I'm not going to do nothing right so but you still gamble that's a vice right it's a vice but it's not lifethreatening in any way right unless your bookie kills you right it's quality of lifethreatening arguably some bookies don't really kill you they don't they want their money back money they to make a deal I had a bookie take all my money and uh cuz I won so much and then my bud is like oh man you got to break his leg and stuff right and I'm like what I'm already had all this money I'm not going to yeah you won a bet what was

with these crazy like ideas you go like uh hey why don't you come out with like a red wig on and I'm like why why would I do that he goes ah the gals are teasing bar bar about her new hair tint I'm like n yeah that seems all right you know cuz I'm trying to be nice I have a hard time saying no you know so maybe he goes and then so finally I go I'll think of something you know so he's and I'm at a a poker table the whole time talking to him and you know cuz I I used to play for like 7 hours straight and so he F keeps F he's like I got it man he's like you carry out a cell phone on of the show right then he goes halfway during the show your cell phone rings you know and it's your agent Morty you know so you pick it up you're like hey man I'm on The View this is no time to talk here Morty you know he goes Morty's not on the line you're just pretend you know and it's a terrible time Morty I'm on the TV you know so I go oh yeah that sounds good you know with no intention of really doing that right now what time did you go to bed that night I didn't go to bed so I'm driving to the stupid view right and uh I go I I had this story about Cosby so I go I'll do that story about meeting Bill Cosby you know so I show up and they're put makeup on go I go I'll be go what are you going to talk about I go I I'm cool man just tell him uh do you ever meet Bill Cosby so uh so as I'm walking in the producer unbeknownst to me slips the cell phone in you know go remember our bit I yeah you got out of the red wig though yeah I know I didn't have to do that this a long got to be a long story but what happened it's good though I went on The View and you know they're supposed to just talk to you now this was when uh this was a long time this was when Pres president uh Bush was uh he wasn't the president he was running for the presidency right right so I don't know nothing about politics right but Ben Stein had called me and he said that you know Ben Stein so you know like when Clinton came like there was like 10,000 like stri sers Schwarz there everybody you know showed up and then when Bush show up was just me and benstein he used to be a speech writer for Nixon yeah that is a very sobering homecoming for Bush just nor McDonald and the airport good God I got to talk to him for a half hour in Air Force anyway wow the story is I go on The View and as soon as I get on The View I'm all tired and everything I'm like all right ladies uh what's going on in the news Bill Cosby what's going on and so all of a sudden they show a picture of me standing next to George Bush who's running for presidency and they go hey check this out who whoa nor I'm like you know as if it was a picture of Kurt volim standing behind side Hitler in the wood you know and I'm like what's this all about you know like I'm crazy right and I go I don't know so just to get on their nerves I go well it's better than that last guy Clinton he was a he murdered a guy and so then Barbara Walter is like

thought he murdered a guy I said it about six times you know so uh she's like what about Bill Cosby be fair to her she thought you were Tim madow to be fair to her so anyways and so the whole audience is all in shock and on everything I don't know how to react to this all craziness and all of a sudden like my cell phone rings right got the bit yeah on the phone i' forgotten about it it was coming from the speakers I didn't know what it was like that and then it occurred to me and I pulled out the cell phone I'm like hey uh Morty this is a terrible time to call right so then Barber walk goes

mister that was the end of that she said it was Vince Foster calling from the Beyond she's calling from Hell says she'll see you soon Norm's got a new CD out called ridiculous Norm when we left off we were talking about Bill Cosby and you never getting to tell your Bill Cosby story on The View but you can certainly tell it here oh Bill Cosby well I opened for Bill Cosby and uh I was really excited you know cuz I'm a comedian and he was like the first comedian I ever heard and everything and I still love him you know and uh so I was real excited and everything and uh so uh and we're performing oh my Lord it was like an entire football field right well where is it it was LSU M and U I'm sorry it was Tulsa uh it doesn't matter right you didn't have to correct yourself and uh so I get there and uh so entire football field in a little tiny stage and I have no way of knowing how to you know so I'm like you know anyone have an answering machine and then you're just they're just talking to each other I have no idea of how to talk to this many people you know so they completely ignore me for the whole thing but you know they don't hate me or anything they just don't notice me they're ambivalent so I'm like how on Earth uh you know so I was interested in seeing how Bill Cosby do so Bill Cosby lands in a helicopter like 10 minutes before and he's wearing a sweatshirt and I mean a suit and everything you know and he Sayes why are you wearing the suit I said oh girl calls me he goes H call it he talks like just didn't work he doesn't use he goes College sweatshirt and I'm like

sa and everybody screams Lou and he goes l s you exactly so he says it about five times every time slower and now they're going up and down like they're in a lather you know right and then he goes next week I will be performing LSU and I'll be doing that bit backwards laugh ni he amazing but anyways afterwards so I I I talked to I go oh man you're the best you know I listen to you as a kid and everything my dad and my dad like was racist but he loved you you know it's the ultimate compliment it is it tempered like his racism and stuff yeah it's telling it's like telling a cow that your mom's vegan but will was willing to eat just you yes so much she loves you yeah if you want to compare an African-American to a cow that would be a good analogy well you don't want to pick another animal one that makes I'm a tree and eat bananas this is getting ugly Let's uh all right nor come on reel it in so Cosby says to me U so I said yeah my dad loves you he goes where does your dad live I

if you I offered you a million dollars to cut off your leg would you accept you offered me a million do to cut off your right leg no no I would not accept that if I offered you a million do to cut off your left leg would you accept no but what about if I offered you a million dollars to cut off both of your arms no would you accept you would not accept no no so you're admitting to me that your arms and legs are worth more than $3 million then treat them like that treat them like that for God's sakes treat them like that I would get a million each for each limb no no cuz I would take that I'd take 3 million for two arms and a leg I'd do that I'd take 3 million for two arms and a leg but not 1 million for one leg no just I could use three million I'd sit around watch TV all day tap my fingers on my one good hand i' have I'd have the remote right yeah yeah no I you know you lose your  too yeah well what how much how much for chopping the off you never mentioned that that was implied I actually have I actually have questions here I actually have some questions you got some questions let's let's uh I said no questions really no no this is what I saw after the trial s stupid jurors are after the OJ trial I see this big fat woman that was on there because you tend to think of uh jurors as wise or something I don't know why you know but you tend to think of them as wise people jurors right but afterwards they interviewed this one woman that was a juror big fat woman doesn't have doesn't have anything to do with anything I her weight but she was huge right and uh so smart she probably would have known to to not eat so many cheeseburgers exactly so this fat Pig no no now so they're interviewing her you know and they're they're asking her about the blood evidence because uh because um Darden talked about the blood evidence for six straight days yeah he introduced all this Blood evidence that showed that you know was a trillion to one that it could wasn't OJ you know so they say well say this woman they say uh well you know what about the blood evidence yeah so she goes everybody got blood he goes if it fit don't fit you must quit yep she remembered the rhyme sure the rhyming was what did it I think a guy was telling me that uh do you know the do you know the lawyer Jerry Spence are you familiar with that lawyer he's from Colorado and he wears a cowboy hat cowboy hats all the time Fringe he wears Fringe yeah yeah the yeah yeah so apparently in the closing arguments you can say anything you know you're not bound by any anything so um I know this guy who worked at a law firm and he said every time Jerry Spence would be the the the defense you know he'd always get everybody off and this is what he'd do he'd say no matter what the facts of the case were he'd say and that's he'd talk about the case and they go that's it ladies and gentlemen oh before I go I'd like to tell you a story and then the other the the the prosecution would go objection then the lawyer the judge would go let him tell the story so uh then he tell the story and this was the story he would go ladies and gentlemen of the jury I'd like to tell you a story about a a young boy precocious young boy that went up to a very wise old man and the boy held in his hand a bird and uh he said to the wise old man he said you are the wisest man that I know I have a bird in my hand and I'm going to give you a puzzle if you say A you can say a or you can say B if you say a I will let the bird go or I will crush the bird if you say B I will let the bird go or I will crush the bird what do you say old man A or B and the old man thought about it and the old man looked at the boy and he said Son the bird is in your hand hands ladies and gentlemen the bird is in your hands and he said like 20 minutes later they come back  innocent sort of like a multi-purpose uh closing comment yeah it worked for everything works every time yeah that's good and so then the woman that drowned her 14 children she'd get off because of the bird story yeah"

Say, Here you go... nothing. ( laughter ) That's from me to you, there's nothing at all there. Cardboard I'm giving you this year! ( laughter and loud talking from offstage front ) Unless it wins then...then it's good but but imagine it wins that'd be the worst y'know? ( very loud talking in front ) You give a guy a ticket and it wins. You don't want a guy to win... you want him to lose. Imagine getting a call from the guy like a week after Christmas. You go ""What's that Bill?. Yeah I remember that ticket I gave ya... 14 million bucks huh? "" ( polite laugh ) Ahaahahaha Well Merry Christmas to ya. Guess no chance of that mug you bought me skyrocketing in value some... f*ck it. F*cked up the joke cause some weird things happening over here on my left... ( clamor from a table in front ) ""They're bootin the guy out!"" ( small applause ) ""Excellent... kicking the guy out!"" I love seein guys get kicked out. While I'm doing my little camera thing ( laughs ) Ha ha ha Crazy huh? Crazy! ( applause ) So I guess my little lottery joke and the guy getting kicked out thing worked out pretty good! Exactly the way I planned it! ( Laughter ) ( quietly ) just what I was hoping for.... So I got some clothes today. I was gonna buy some clothes for this little video thing This is what I ended up with... I got his green shirt, and you ever, you ever buy clothes at a store? Heh? ( laughs ) I go to this store y'know... And I don't know nothing about stuff I don't know what looks good or anything y'know,  I go to the store and you ever see those stores where the things aren't even Marked where you can tell which is the girl stuff and which is the guy stuff? It's just all the same and ya end up choosing something right out of your sex? That's embarrassing You go "" Yeah salesman I'm interested in this right here"". And then the guy goes "" What are ya?"" ( Laughter ) It's a girdle!! ...and you go ""Oh...well. I thought it was....a hat. "" To me...that's a hat! and sometimes you gotta you go in and try clothes on in those little rooms? and then people can see you... because the door doesn't fit you right y'know? The door will go like that on you cause they're like little rodeo doors they got in there.. then people see your naked shoulders and naked shins and everything like that y'know... People be shopping and you look em right in the eye and they're going ""You're naked over there huh?"" ( Laughter ) You go ""Yeah a little bit yeah..."" ( laughter ) The only fun part of the whole experience for me is that I get to try on clothes looking at that mirror you know They have those special mirrors in department stores where they go in like that and then you cut across And it's some kind of magic mirror where you can see like a hundred different angles on yourself And I can look at that mirror forever you know? ( Laughter ) It's like forget the shirt how much for the mirror? Wrap up the mirror! Sometimes you see weird angles! You ever see those angles? you look and it's like... Jeez look at me from that angle over there! I hope no one ever stands right there and looks at me ... I'm like a big ear from over there!! What the hell will people think? must think I'm ear-man or something when you stand over there! ( Laughter ) But that's how you wanna be seen eh?, how other people see you from different angles Y'know? You can't get that with a regular mirror at home. Y'know, you can try and look at it fast like that y'know?...( Laughter ) ..but then you see your own eye looking back at ya there that doesn't work at all.. ( laughter ) The only time you can really see yourself is when you don't notice Sometimes you'll be walking down the mall there...( singing ) doodlydoodlydoo.. Ho!! That was me there in the mirror there for a second! ( laughter ) I like mirrors, but you don't wanna be caught looking in the mirror because people think you're vain, y'know which you are but you don't want people to know it! So.. Sometimes you'll be looking at a mirror and a guy catches you , y'know... Oh! The mirror! I was just looking at it! I didn't notice my reflection, or anything like that... ( Laughter ) ""Oh look there's me in there...heh...how about that..."" Ever notice some mirrors are better than other mirrors? You'd think all mirrors would be the same you know but sometimes You'd be in a bathroom you're getting ready for the night, you go. ""Hey look at me in the mirror there. Oh yeah I'm looking good..."" ""Okay, I'm ready to go out now looking good. Like I do..."" Then you walk by the mirror in the bedroom you look in there and go ""Hey I look like sh*t"" here I...what happened? ""What the hell happened to me between the bathroom and here?"" ( Laughter ) ""...this mirrors shot here..."" ( Laughter ) So to come down here.

All you can do is see the side of their faces having fun up in the front seat there... See their profiles goin... ( laughter ) Lotta that... Some guys y'know you ever meet those guys they say ""ah forget it man! I've had enough of this backseat/frontseat garbage... man, I'll just stick my head into the front seat ( laughter ) That's a breach of automotive etiquette there huh? Just invade front seat airspace with their big head there y'know? ( laughter ) ""Hi! what're you guys talkin about?"" ""...it's me from the backseat...!"" Naw, y'know just try and hang out back there and keep together you know now you're regressing into childhood after a while back there... with nothing to do and everything you can't listen to 'em cause the musics way to loud back there. Y'know You can only check for quarters you can do that, you know, look for quarters... You ever look for quarters and find something grizzly back there? ( laughter ) Oh what the hell was that? That wasn't a quarter there. I think that used to be a cat or something...I don't know what the hell that was... Certainly wasn't legal tender of any sort. Then you make a little drawing on the window in the window you go...( breathes heavily ) While a away a few seconds on that little game. After a while you get so lonely in the back seat you start trying to make contact with other people in other back seats along the road... ( laughter ) Look out your little window there... ( laughter ) Could be a cow on a flatbed truck for all you care... I know it's livestock but it notices me there I think I caught a cattle's eye there...!

You can really tell it's bad in the back seat by the seat belt. You ever see those little stinking little seatbelts they give you? They give you just around there. You know just Bisect you in case of an accident y'know? ( laughter ) Those are the seat belts they banned from the front seat back in the fifties ( laughter ) Front seat got y'know everything up there you got big things comin over here, across a big air bag and right on impact a medic jumps out of your glove compartment...

Well in a major car accident, wouldn't want to walk away with a hurt neck... You're in the back seat that headrest just be like a face Smasher to you... ( Laughter ) Grimly mocking you for the whole trip there... ( more laughter ) ( lots of laughter and murmuring ) It's worse to share a backseat. you ever be three guys all stuck in the backseat. You're all... You know and you're crunched in with two guys right beside you and you're in the middle. That's the worst backseat middle. That's the worst spot of all. Nobody ever chooses, that spot y'know. You never say ""Hey can I get backseat middle?"" People trick you into it. ""okay here, you  jump in and I'll jump in then the next guy'll jump in but he won't to run around and trap you in the middle..."" and you go ""Okay, ( defeated laugh ) hahaa....I'll buy that!"" and then you get all crunched in y'know....and you can't relax y'know... like the two guys beside you sit back relax, and you can't because you're responsible for thigh contact or something some unwritten law there ... ...as soon as you relax it's like ""hey, what are ya ..."" You go ""Oh that's right I forgot I guess..."" and you're really in a vulnerable position there backseat middle, no rope around ya or nothing there y'know... Just like a cannon waitin to go off there... Hit a red light, bang right through the window. there you go... Soaring down the road three miles people look up ""Hey look there, backseat middle there..."" ( laughter ) Somebody probably fished him into that spot... ( laughter ) ..What a fish!.. Aaaahhh, So I don't have my license you know but I always wanted to be a trucker you know and ah, of course I can't be a trucker cause I don't have my drivers licence and... Makes the resume look pretty skimpy, as soon as they see that... ( laughter ) Y'know they won't even get to the hobbies after they see that you don't even have your license y'know? Too bad too because one of my hobbies is collecting old trucks... but I always wanted to be a trucker y'know? Driving a big truck... they are intimidating though when you're in a car. You ever behind a big big truck full of trembling logs right in front a ya? Holy cow! Sometimes you see those trucks where the cargo of the truck will be just wrecked cars. just a bunch of wrecked cars. Holy cow man. I hit this guy he won't even notice! ( laughter ) I'll just become part of the haul! ( laughter ) Six months later ""Oh! There's a guy in this one!"" ( laughter ) Yeah can you let me out already? ( laughter ) I got a kink! ( laughter ) Yeah a trucker. That'd be great you know When you're on the road people say hey if you want to eat follow the truckers cuz they know the best restaurants... That's true to a certain extent like truckers know the best restaurants but a truckers idea of a good restaurant is not great food you know? Truckers idea  of a good restaurant? Big GIANT parking lot! ( laughter ) Bascially all they care about yknow? You got a big giant parking lot outside your house trucks'll just show up there... ( laughter ) ""You got anything to eat?"" ( laughter ) But sometimes I go in there and just pretend to be a trucker you know I just walk into a truck stop get out of the car pretend to be a trucker cuz they don't know y'know?, you just pretend Sometimes they'll buy it they'll talk to you like a trucker there y'know and say ""what are you hauling?"" What are you hauling? You gotta make something up you go. pig iron Ahhhhh! ( laughter ) I'm going over there now ahhhh! I'm still a trucker though ahhhh... then you sit down and you eat at their big tables. Everything's big at a truck stop eh? Big oak tables that thick...everything's big for a big trucker big forks about that big Spear giant spuds with 'em eat 'em...whole! ( laughter ) They bring ya coffee don't even ask y'know because they say here's your coffee you're a trucker. There's your coffee you go ""Ahhhhh!"" It's the greatest... They bring you your little menus and you order your stuff there y'know? They're always very simple minimal kind of menus eh? Right to the point down to earth. Items on it be like a.... ...egg. ( laughter ) ...coffee... you never see 'two fluffy farm fresh eggs and a.. pipin' hot pot of coffee! ( laughter ) I thought you bring me egg I got no time for adjectives here! ( laughter ) I'm a trucker here, hey! ( Laughter ) I love the little...girl's, the women that come and they're all 'Marge'. That's their names, the waitresses Y'know, says 'Marge' right there... and you talk to them like no other waitresses. you go ""Ahhh Marge, arghh! I'll marry you one day, Ahhhh!"" and they go ( in high voice ) ""Ohhh, my husband will have yer hide, Burt!"". Always call myself Burt... Then you buy your stuff You know you eat your little thing and everything it's great man. Coffee limitless coffee endless cup and bottomless loaf of bread and that's the life. Sometimes they bring, you ever see that stuff they bring you and it's not even cream? like it's not cream, and it looks like cream ...but it's not cream, but you say hey bring me some cream and they bring it and it says 'Not Cream' right on it and you go hey This is not cream, I asked specifically for cream and this is.. NOT Cream here, this not cream ( laughter ) and sometimes it's like some weird cold like some edible oil product y'know like what the hell's that? it says edible right on it you know, that's not good y'know? Not the most ringing endorsement you can ask for a food stuff there... what the hell does edible mean? That means it just barely passed some tests! That's what it means... ( laughter ) But you know it turns out that after you eat you always go to the gift shop and buy a little gift You know like they'll have maybe a hat they always have a hat with a little joke on a little dirty joke you know yeah like a rhyme like, 'Da-da-da-da-da cock...' ( laughter ) da-da-da-da-da, word that rhymes with cock...' ( laughter ) Yeah, give me a hat with the cock and the rhymes...thank you... ( laughter ) Sometimes the stuff on that hat is just dirty there ain't no joke at all. I saw one said 'sh*t head' It had a chunk of sh*t on the hat. ( laughter ) Came in children sizes too that was the frightening part... Oh with Billy's birthday around the corner, imagine his look of delight! When he finds out he has a sh*t head hat there... Actually psychiatrists now say there's nothing better for a seven-year-old's self esteem than a piece of human waste on his head ( laughter ) They used to think it was a bad thing back in the dark ages of psychology ( laughter ) By God, We've come a long way since then! Well Well, I forgot to do my little watch thing  I was puttin on my watch thing and then a guy started screaming at me like a maniac. that I forgot to hit it y'know? Some guy with a well thumbed copy of 'Catcher in the Rye' in the front seat here. Okay, so you guys have been great and thank you very much enjoy all the rest of the show ( applause )"
Norm Macdonald,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5eMHuFrcSw,      what the  is one of them acid flashbacks i did acid when i was 17 years old four times that's the last time i did it i remember when i did it everybody would tell me they go hey listen you gotta be careful because you'll get a flashback and uh so i thought hey that seems like a pretty good deal so i went to my drug dealer frank i said listen i understand you got a drug on the market now where i give you five dollars i get high now and then i get high 20 years later really that's true man well i've always considered myself a chap who likes to stretch his drug dollars count  anyways i'm here to tell you that 10 years has passed 20 you know even 25 and uh still no flashbacks huge  that turned out to be well what are you gonna do just more horseshit by the big acid companies that's all it really is i don't wanna get all bill maher on here if you think the acid companies in this country care about you the little fella then you're living in a fool's paradise all they care about is the third quarter profit i don't even know what a third quarter profit is but i know it fits in that sentence that's what you don't understand then whenever they got pepsi you go ah  i want that you got any other soda pop they go uh yeah we got root beer don't say that they're like wow not eight years old i guess i could drink a root beer yes sierra missed you go oh man i was hoping you did i was going to ask and i didn't dare to because i didn't think i'd be that fortunate and then you got the united states that's a nice country they have a  mexico and all kinds of crazy  i don't understand just whatever so anyways my point is i go all across this great continent except for mexico and i try to tell the kids you know i say listen kids you know you might think it's cool now to eat your buddy but and it is pretty cool you hate a  guy everybody's gonna think you're cool  but in the long run it's a mistake you know what i try to you gotta get them when they're young  sometimes i think i'm kind of on my high horse when it comes to cannibalism you know because because i've never really had to deal with it you know i've always lived in this greatest country you know in this best of all possible worlds and i've never had to really deal with it because you know there's always plenty of cheese sandwiches to eat but what if you lived in a place where there were no cheese sandwiches you know where there was nothing no food at all you know then you know like like for instance you ever hear this place called the andes the andes they don't got no cheese sandwiches there they don't got nothing just just snow and rocks and it's some place and what happens is when people get stranded in the andes their views on cannibalism sometimes will take a radical shift  that's why i never go to the end so i make a point of never going to the end some people they do they go listen uh travel agent i want to go somewhere me and the wife gertrude we want to go away and the kids are you know they were ran all the time and everything and we seem to have lost their we want to rekindle you ever hear that and we want to go someplace where there's an island with a hammock and we thought we'd lie on the hat rekindle and then come back how does that sound and also we want to fly over the to andes to that place is there anything you got we'd like a small plan if you got a small plan we got to go on the dead of winter this is our only conditions that we need the dead of winter a small white plain if it could be point as quaint as possible is there a plan to have it's pure but white that's their choice so anyways they take off on the plane and of course naturally it immediately crashes into the yankees and nobody's surprised you know it even stands right on the boarding pass he goes lay over a mountain  you don't have to be that guy with the big thing to realize that's a clue yeah but sherlock holmes that's a magnifying glass i remember two things at once  but you get this is it you gotta then you gotta when you're there then you gotta wrestle with your conscience you know because and i don't know if you've ever wrestled with your conscience but i haven't but i've heard it's very very tough you know a guy was telling me it's tough it's not as tough he said as wrestling with a actual wrestler but he said it's still tough he told me he said if you got the choice and it'll probably never come out but if you have the choice between wrestling with your conscience and a professionally trained wrestler then choose your conscience on a kind of uh it's got no arms most of wrestling is a headline but no so the plan goes down and then you gotta wrestle with your conscience now it's hard for people now some people you know maybe it's not hard for them maybe even as the plane goes down they'll go i'm eating that  at 34c i've had my eye on him for a while that guy looks delicious most of us are civilized human beings so you're there and you're wrestling with your man there's the co-pilot you know and the first day is easy you go i'm not eating him i don't even  like co-pilot and uh and so but then days turn into weeks and weeks turn into months and my you know time worked and finally it's too much for you you're just a flesh and so you gotta eat but now the problem is you've waited too long like a couple months now you're so hungry you're just ravenously eating them you know he was like ah now that's the wrong way any nutritionist will tell you that that's not good for you you should eat six small portions of copilot every day  and then you got co-pilot blood all over your chimp dropping onto your fruity blue shirt you know  and then isn't that always the time that the rescue helicopter shows up am i right i don't know how could i know nobody knows but uh and then you're like and then they're like we got cheese sandwiches  god damn ah you're right reggie wake up go god damn i got a  kid it's a terrible thing you know i wouldn't want to be a kid  either i don't like you know the thing is you're attracted to something and uh you don't want that to be your type a child it's not good people go jim what do you like in a woman i mean i like big breasts i go i mean i don't like to talk about it that much now seriously what's your type uh it's not big breasts as uh infants one two year olds that's my type i don't know i always found them very sexually attractive well what are you gonna do you know you go what are you gonna go i'm a lutheran you go what are you   i'm an episcopalian but now people think you're  if you're christian meanwhile they're willing to accept any other horse  you know like people go what sign are you i go libra they go that means that you're happy but sometimes you're sad does that sound right what is that i always wondered and the guy go well neptune  what happened was uh you were born and i have a chart of the universe i've made up i made a chart of the universe and i found out when you were born and it turns out that neptune's coaxial orbit was off by a third of a degree now that cast a moon over pluto and anyway the upshot of it is you're a happy fellow but sometimes sad  and you're like yeah why aren't those people returning by the way when i say  obviously you know i'm talking about people with down syndrome i'm not talking about i'm not talking about dumb guys you know i wouldn't call them but the only reason i don't say down syndrome is because i'm not a  doctor i don't know what i mean what am i but i know what  means it means  that word means it means arrested stopped at some point in your development you know what i mean and i love retards that's probably my favorite people in the whole world be  i don't even see the problem i don't know what the  people feel sorry for him you know people go man i said look at that guy over there laughing all happy and   you don't realize the horrors of life should be the opposite i'd  inject  juice young boy you know uh beautiful young boy simon and uh you know one of the perks of being a celebrity is that you get to meet a lot of dying children  i need to go home and try to sleep so i've been about a couple of hundred dying children but anyway simon is a beautiful boy and likely me to save you before i he uh told me this joke or does he call it a riddle he thought he called he thought i was a riddler i don't know what the  he's talking about he wasn't in good shape the doctor said he was more more virus than host now i don't know what that means but it doesn't sound good to me anyways he's a good kid i think he's still with us and this is his joke that he said i should do or is he calling riddle but it's not a riddle it's a joke he called it a riddle because most of his brain stem is fluid at this point but uh this is the joke he's and he prom i promise to say it to him and uh you know a promise unmade is a dead unpainted so uh this is the joke a dog walks into a telegraph office and he says the telegraph guy goes hey no he doesn't say anything the telegraph guy says hey dog he says hey listen he says what do you want me to put on the telegram so the dog goes woof so then the guy writes it down you know then the guy goes hey i just noticed you only have nine words here on your telegram here doc he goes we're at the western union uh this week we got a special 10 words or less same price hey we could put an extra woof on the end if you want and then the dog goes but that wouldn't make any sense why would everyone  what kind of operation are you running here all right listen folks you've been wonderful good luck out there 
Norm Macdonald,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_lsZzfY7Ec,you ready for  nor mcdonald norm and i started out together again i'm just to introduce you ladies and gentlemen norma mcdonald  this is hard to work i have a job that you only have to know about three things and then i don't know about one listen guys oh ladies how'd that get out of my trunk  right right yeah it has to be perfect you know you guys look good you're looking down too low though i should be down there i feel do you want to come down i don't know if i can make the jump i used to i could make that jump can you guys hear me i was unsure because i don't know but uh uh yeah i could make that jump i'll tell you when i was young god damn    uh you know their phones are crap  split sideways think about when you're real remember young you're so young that you're like a  superhero like you're so i when i was young uh i i was at one time i remember a tooth came out knocked out of my mouth and another tooth came grew in  so and now a truth knocked out i'd just drink soup for a while that's how you get that goddamn my dad or see me dentist  like a lot of times i i think of uh my imminent death  it's not a lot of times ruminating by that and uh like i like i i when something happens like i spent a lot of time checking out my left arm i have my left arm feeling today because sometimes it feels weird and then i go oh because symptoms the thing about symptoms this is problem with symptoms does that look like our web mdm the symptom like if you you know the symptom if you have indigestion that's a symptom of a massive heart attack but it's also the symptom of indigestion so you know what the  you do you don't want to go to 911   you're too embarrassed so you just die at home with perfectly good digestion all right casinos i i had a problem for a while gambling i think i'm over it but i don't know i think it's because i'm feeling it you know i feel good people think sometimes i'm a hypochondriac but just being old i swear to god and one time i had a pap smear they might have got the idea oh i didn't know this joke but uh but i i i don't even know why i said it because i was talking about casino and gambling and then i don't want to say that but i was uh i liked him and uh i wonder what's that smoking  i'm not gonna start a moonwalker i don't expect  steely dan will be  but no i do i did gamble a little compulsively for a while and i'll tell you i'll tell you when you know you got a gambling problem is when pit bosses are your friends they like that that's never a good sign because these people do not like uh they're not you know usually affable fellows so suddenly they're your best friend it means you're a  sound and uh many times my best friend has been the pitbull and he's like hey listen norm um can i get you do you like beef can i get some beef you enjoy eating meat i'm like i gave you some free meat man you gotta cook it up back there you can eat it damn you're a nice snow yeah yeah just stay here the casino anything to keep you inside the casino they would do you know you gotta go this is my wife   why is he  in the casino you refer to that craft field but i finally you know started lighting up i tried to jam a little i still do sports and stuff but it's funny you know you see things in consideration spot things like because i was again bad gambler and i can spot like you know people get systems and  they come to casino like i got a system i'm gonna figure i will play my system and uh and then one time i saw you could tell this guy trying to system and it hadn't worked because he was going up on the elevator with his wife and he said to his wife he said i don't give a  what i said give me the money it's my money i earned it   you telling casinos the winners of the losers if you have a sharp eye you know and because the winners man they're on top of the world they're singing you know just you can tell by their body language if you're a student of body language you know which i am and uh they're just it up uh i wonder how much you have chandelier cops how are you outside by that channel here good  i wonder what i get for your shoes people out of these shoes  but listen man either the world is uh becoming very progressive and beautiful or it's going to hell in a hand basket i can't tell which but uh there's this lady caitlyn beautiful lady caitlyn jenner she's so beautiful that's what i can i can't tell her how beautiful she and i find uh her timing couldn't have been worse because um i uh uh am of an age whereas when i was a boy they had the olympics in 76 and she won the decathlon she was the greatest athlete the greatest athlete in the world in 1976 was a lady isn't that amazing so that would have been a great moment for the feminist movement if you know they put the girl medal around and i was like by the way i'm a lady sweetie like if you're a 65 year old man is it that much different than a 65 year old the  the difference and you just wait an extra 15 years and die you smell that nonsense   certain very certain circumstances but uh because that was one thing i was thinking i i'm suck at  basketball men's basement but i'll build a women's basketball i'd probably be a pretty good like sixth woman first of all i'm huge i'm six two i'm a giants and they couldn't stop me because i'm a woman see when i was young you know i i would say to my member said i said to my father listen i'm a lady you know and my father would go wait now but you got a  and i go oh yeah  i forgot but anyways that's how ignorant we were back then  we found back then having  anyway it's nice now to have a choice and uh and i thought of a time when i would have a choice here's the thing let's say something came from my past because we all have secrets in our past and i'm not uh i'm not listen i'll tell you i'll tell you the secrets of my thoughts um i one time i'm guilty of one well one real serious crime many you know sins but one legal crime which is the crime of manslaughter a long time ago and uh you don't need to know all the details but the gist of the thing was i slaughtered a van   and i was like god damn i've slaughtered a man he was like blaze slaughtered before me oh slaughtered to hell and uh i didn't know at that time that manslaughter is actually less of a crime than murder because it was way worse in real life but anyway should that ever come out like shouldn't uh you know the way the comet got on stage and outed cosby maybe one time a comic will come out on stage and out of me maybe it'll be me maybe i just did and uh they look and they you know you guys are that's a joke but then somebody goes maybe i should look into that and they go to a certain place and find a slaughtered man long since slaughtered man with my dna all over them i did some stuff to him after which i'm not proud of him well we all made mistakes and our youth but listen the point is if i was if i went to jail the judge said you have been convicted of manslaughter but because the jury found that you slaughtered that man have you anything to say for yourself then i would say yes i only have one thing to say i am a lady there you go you're not lady and i go you  bigot how dare you say that i think i am a lady and i should know more than anybody who would know more if i'm a lady you some judges i'm sorry or me a lady now ship me out to lady's jail  get me over there  because i feel that would be a big hit in ladies   very popular the uh my body is gonna as a girl she's gonna show me on youtube apparently they have gender uh reclassification surgery if you watch and uh i said i'd rather watch  isis videos  it's in its infancy that particular procedure even most of the people that turn into ladies go i'm keeping my  yeah i think about the whole thing go i'm a lady with a cop what the  is that and i'm a lesbian huh how the  does that work i could i could definitely go for that  go i'm a lady with a  lesbian and then the lesbians of course would like you on account and you got to cut you don't have to go buy one in the store on the way home for the lesbian part the only way   oh   but listen i don't pretend i understand not me man just the old chunk of cold trying to figure out life  sexual manners of any sort confused me and it's because i'm of my age you know i'm 51 to score 11. as abraham lincoln what's called that i'm 51 and uh yeah my card doesn't work that well i'll be honest you guys will realize when you turn 51 because when you're young work forever and then it doesn't you're 51 then you're like once and then it still works technically but it's not you know the same here you see pornos it's like the hottest little girl and that guy is like hanging out and doing all this filthy stuff then she takes the guy's pants down his cock's not hard  anyway that's kind of like me    it's hard  retiring from  because once it gets to the point where you're like you know it's all bendy and you're trying to command it and you know what crap  most of the sex i had with ladies never worked out too good you know one thing is you gotta both like the same things you know what i mean you ever be with a ladies you like something completely different but she's very pretty so you go along with it like one day i have a little girl so beautiful and then she's like i know what you like i'm like how would you have did you so i got into town but i look at it i go what is it that i like she goes you like rough sex i'm like  yes that's true and then i don't have you ever tried that but uh holy god so now i'm wrestling with her  i find hard enough to maintain an erection during tax time you know let alone let alone i got some lady in that headlock one woman was like i want you to rape me i'm like you know you say you want you that ain't rape if you want it you know i could come back in a few days with a rock when you're not expected you know i'm just a simple fella man i've never appointed one of those guys go you know i doubt we ever see this guy like this be i would whip my balls and shut a giant thing on my i don't know how that that must happen in stages you know that's why i never you know like i just find a lady i uh convinced her uh to let me lie down on top of her that's it nothing none of fancy and you never want to go with one little step because it's a slippery slope before the giant thing you know so that's my advice to any of you young people just lying on top of them and if you feel like because they'll always try to put their finger in your ass and be like oh i know this leads to but if you want to have really good sex find a lady convince her to lie down lay down underneath me get her to sign a form that says that put that in a safe and then line and then lie down on top and then cover yourself with about 12 layers of quilts turn off all the light so it's stygian blackness and then get off her later maybe i'll retire have a like a press conference go yes because anything else you can retire you know what i mean like a job everybody retires a job but at some point you go  abernathy i'm not  listening to that  no more i had it i had it with abernathy i'm gonna retire and daphne and i are gonna go to costa rica's and we're gonna lie on a hammer and rekindle our thing or like i've retired i used to play reckless hockey all the time and one time uh two years ago i just said i can't do it no more man i can't my arch is a guy i got you guys are young they're hitting me hard they're out skating me you know a lot i lost four teeth total i'm lucky they've lost only that few and i you know it broke my heart but i had to hang up the whole tackle berries and everybody understood man they're like oh yeah but somehow sex you're not supposed to you know like i would love to just go listen i i'm announcing my retirement for  and i'd like to thank them eight ladies that led me like ann on top it was very nice of them i really appreciate it i know they didn't care much for it  that's the other part about sex when you're a dude because um you know the lady is not having nearly as much fun as you it must be different for a lady because they see the guys having crazy fun but you know dudes are just looking at the ladies you can tell the ladies not having fun because the dude is usually telling the lady even in pornography where they're like you i guess  i just said tell me you like it yeah yes yeah trust me  what is it in porno they're so mean to the girl like i watch it the girls could not be more accommodating like like just instantly have sex with the dude they never did that with me ever i've been once on tv actually on tv these guys they just got a futon and a light bulb and  baby's very accommodating nice enough and then the guys need to and then even the title itself is like dirty  guzzling   i'm like well that's not the film i just watched that seemed to be mostly the feller's idea   should be the greatest lady in the world that i ever met one time  i gotta desensitize that porno  because at first man you can't watch it enough you're wagging out six times a day you can't believe people and they never see the same girl twice like why is every girl a  what happened what the  happened in this world and then you get decent at first it's great but you know a couple of months in you're desensitized nothing works for you anymore you know you're just like what's this she can only take egg  on your asking why don't you get in the business if you're gonna be approved i'll find a different thing  i'll find a worse than a person can do or another person  you become matted by the entire thing i still like i still like whacking out it takes me a while like i don't feel like i gotta whack off i'm so happy man i feel like whacking up instead i go i wonder if i could make myself feel like whacking out but you think the imagination it takes to light up you know like you have to you have to imagine a scenario that is not real at all and imagine it to such a point you know that uh you know even like paranoid schizophrenics have a tough time going that far into believing that they're with a lady when they're not you know and uh but somehow you do it and uh you you create a scenario in your mind where you're with a lady and you're the lady this is men but ladies are different i don't know i can't speak for ladies but sometimes i've had i have asked ladies like what do you think about when you're masturbating and then they go to win very advanced but for a guy he has to think of a scenario you know in his mind like and uh like i don't have the imagination yeah some guys will read like playboy and  or victoria's secret or something like that i can't do that uh because i don't got the imagination for it like i've tried i'm like hey there lady i'm opening to them too all right listen let me take your underwear up over there well that makes sense i guess sorry about asking here it has to be it has to be a lady that i i think that would actually have sex with me like um about three blocks from where i live there's a 7-eleven right the girl works there you know yeah the greatest looking lady in the world you know um a plain kind of face you know and very no personality to her at all like just a blank blankness no breasts there's no breasts it's not a god but anyways uh the point of the she has long hair that's one thing long brown hairs we're down there so uh anyways i know that because one time i was buying some sour cream chips and i said she says to me hey i like sour cream chips i was like yeah that's interesting and then she goes no i really like sour cream chips i was like and then you know a moment comes where you're like wait a second we're talking about more of the sour cream orange chips sour pineapple chips just the shadow of what we're talking about anyways that happened about i'd say three months ago ever since then i've been whacking off thinking about her she has no idea if she knew any of them should be appalled  but yeah yeah yeah so in my mind i create this is a weird thing in my mind somehow i can create a thing that's not real that's so powerful that it brings me to this place of filth swinish but expulsion it's incredible to me that it could be that you could bring yourself to that you know but i'll be because i'm just lying in bed in reality but in my mind i'm like ah there you are they give you a little time out there huh    crazy stuff that i've never done in real life i'm like ah what about this ah and then uh all of a sudden you know there's a four second issue and then all of a sudden boom you're back in reality and that's the worst moment ever there's no lady it's just me it's just me all alone i gotta get a hold of myself gotta get ahold of that's myself i'll go downstairs i'll make myself a cheese sandwich sure that's what i'll do   so it's weird having a complete psychic break like that but it's fun i never had a bad time but you know guys there are some guys who uh whack off while hanging themselves from the net now have you ever heard of this it's called autoerotic asphyxiation very fancy name for a very filthy thing and it should be called whacking off while you  try to hang yourself but uh and listen i understand hanging yourself in the neck until dead  that well you don't where you live a  cotton candy house or something  so you're living life we're always so i understand that but i don't understand just for whacking up i mean you know but i understand the reason like they said apparently if you uh it cuts off your oxygen supply so it makes your orgasm that you have something like uh i think it's one and a half times as powerful as the orgasm that you had last thursday so i didn't understand that but in my mind there's bigger problems in the  world yeah i don't want to get off bill maher on your ship but what about the forest where you know it's raining isn't that more important than that how bad we're gonna personally i don't think whacking up is not as that bad i think it's good i it's one of the few things in all my life that hasn't you know let me down  i've never wrapped up go god damn that was tedious rickety stool  that's three over two times more one i stronger four days events the uh here's the thing and i know kung fu did it and stuff i'm not trying to say i'm not up here saying i was firing kung fu but just an ambulance one kid but there's a problem because if you do that you know and then it accidentally kill you then they think you kill you know and you're like ah and then they find you nobody knows what happens after you die you know no no people claim they do but no one really knows it's a question that's plagued mankind since the dawn of time but i do know what happens right after you die and that is you are found  here's how you don't want to be bound because you know the ones that i always find what does that let's say it's your son find you like that yeah is that worth the the the orgasm i don't believe it isn't sometimes i think people think that if they're good parents the child will remember them as good but that's not true because children don't like memory don't work like a movie like a motion picture you don't remember much you know you just remember like little snapshots of you know so so jimmy and i are gonna go i remember my dad yeah i remember when i was five he took me to disneyland and it was hot man i was 90. and he stood with me in line two hours got a mickey mouse autograph and then killing heat and he knew what mickey mouse he knew some college  kid but he waited because he loved me and i remember he he had two jobs he didn't have much and um i remember he come one time into my bedroom it was late at night and he was working a second job driving happening you coming to my bedroom and i i was awake i pretend to be asleep i was awake i heard him come in and he'd come up to me and kiss me on the bridge of my nose on the lower of my forehead and then the next day i woke up and he was gone because he had to go to his other job because he worked two jobs so that all they remember   if i ever did it if i ever did it i would pretend like i would pretend it was a real suicide so if anything went wrong you see i've read a known ariana yeah that wave is a real suicide and then your loved one finds you there ah gross you know they'll go oh mysterious mysterious i would never tell you to hang yourself in the neck until dead or anything but you know how people always go i want to be remembered that you will be remembered  because i have suicides in my family and uh like the first one i was my great grandfather not maybe not my first one but the first one i remember my great grandfather he was in the depression the great depression and uh so every time anybody talks about the depression and how bad it was i go god damn right it was bad what about my great grandfather he went to the north 40 found the sturdiest of the poplar trees and uh and uh and took some rope and uh and his spirit lifted up and people go god damn he sounds mysterious oh god damn right he was mysterious but like if you go hey man my aunt ruth i got to tell you about her she died in congestive heart failure people go don't tell that story no more she was sort of markedly unmysterious never really put my finger on until you said it in that way but very unmysterious i don't know what i would write in my suicide note on account of i've been very lucky in my life i've been blessed with friends and you know god has given me uh much more than he's taken from me that's all you can ask for in this here world but uh so i know you know do i i would i wouldn't have anybody what if that's a practical joke you just like you know blame your barber or something oh that's a good idea yo stan crenshaw's fault because then you know the police would have to go they'd be compelled to go to crenshaw's barbershop will you stand grincher yes sir i am no that's not why we're here we're on official business you ever hear a fella who went by the name of norm mcdonough yes sir i used to trim his hair every couple weeks well he took his life because of you he says it on this piece of baby franchise the rest of his life spent franchise retracing the life that he's had  i would say that ranks as one of the worst practices  that's a kind of practical joke getting raped by the devil for all time i try to live my life so that i don't spend eternity being raped by the devil so i try to be good as good as i i can be you know it can't be that good without the grace can't be good at all but um like you think about it i'm i'm a christian by the way but like i like people a lot of times they think christians are like oh i'm better than everybody and  but actually no we're the worst sinners of all christians you know like for instance look at me right i'm a christian and i eat apples  page one of the books  delicious i don't like that one i mean i i don't like that they get to name it red delicious i don't think it reflects well on the people that make red delicious apples that they named their apple red delicious i really don't  you know like at the apple naming convention whatever the  it is like bill what do you name your apple i'm calling it uh rome how come i'd say how come on account i figured i'd stick a stick around beside and say rome and then people buy the apple and because this would have me and daphne went to rome about three years ago to rekindle and we thought put rome on there people you'd have to see rome maybe in their head subconsciously now last year and then one day maybe yeah man that's nice what about you what do you call your album called macintosh how come because uh um when i was a boy why did i call that dad when i was a boy my neighbor oh hugh mcintyre you know he rocked this earth like all of us he had his hopes and dreams but that's all they ever were it was as if he never left a footprint he said i found a lot of stuff looking man more than you think and coins in my life i have found over six hundred dollars in different coins dollar bills found pocket watches and necklaces no banner but i must admit that i i didn't see the clouds and the firmament above the sun breaking through it i didn't see the moon at night the benefits of moon  do you have any regrets and he said uh only  i expired and then  and you know how this anger feels something happened nothing happened he was exactly the same dead as he was alive i uh thought i'd name my apple pack so that people would know that there was a man named hugh mcintyre she one one day lived as did we all do and watched this whirling cinder we choose to call her who are you sam what are you calling here i'm i think i'm red delicious what the  you don't get delicious i already did what do you mean it's already in the store i got food red delicious i put a stick around you  you can't do that why not your names are good too what's wrong  i'll tell you what's wrong with it you know what's wrong with it our apples are also red never occurred to you that maybe people would just infer that our apples were not delicious never occurred to you  me  you i was the guy trying to get kicked out of the apple board last year but listen not everything has to make sense sometimes it's fun you know incoherent words put together ramblings out of the way bill cosby you know it's been such a weird year or something bill cosby was my hero i grew up because you know i always want to be a stand-up and everything when i was young you know he was a king you know and i i so admired love bill cosby and uh you know i tried to emulate him you know i never liked his comedy that's the only thing i never liked one of his jokes  that was like him as a man my buddy he was saying you know the worst thing about cosby was the hypocrisy he's a hypocrite i said i don't think that's the worst i think the rape was the worst and then the drugging of the before the rape and then thinking of the thing and drugging and then raping and then finding some dude to give you some drugs that would make you great for that a lot of things until you get down is that bad what do you think about right most rapists are hypocrites running around i love raping at least not mr  you know it's like when they charge you know when they charge criminals and they charge them with the major crimes but then they charged with some weird little crime like i remember that guy in chicago he killed all the nurses he was insane he like raped and murdered like nine nurses and uh richard speck so they charged him with nine counts of murder nine counts of rape and one count of breaking an entrance  so then the defense is like i tell you that door was open oh my god  you know that no lady ever woke up in some hotel room all drugged up with a cosby  in her face  hypocrisy    hypocrisy you are still against the fire that guy's that hypocrite i don't know i mean who the  is a hypocrite how do you have a kid and not be a hypocrite like i have a kid i don't want him to know who i am thank god my father never told me who he really was i get to still love him man i miss my dad sometimes mostly i don't but sometimes i do fades away you know after a while that's what's great about time you know there are things about time that you know especially as you get old you know that the snow gets a little deeper steps get our minds steeper i'm testing my material for when i get to be a real old man 20 years now oh crashly man i don't like anything when i was a kid everything was different as it did top of something you made your beans in ash with something yeah eat for breakfast with your eggs now the diner acid somebody else you don't have a fellow's face when you dance with your wife it's just the ecstasy it's just a feeling you had suffused your viscera with excitement through that acid i wrote some  down and then i can't read my own bad name oh no name fame famous famous oh yes famous people are famous uh nowadays for odd things as we all know that um um like if you have a if you're a lady with a huge giant ass somehow you can become enormously famous whereas when i was a young kid uh you know and a woman came by with a big giant ass people get the  out of here you big ass good god did that woman have a big ass or what because that's that anyway she's gone now good luck with her ever finding a job anyways cowboy i found out cowboys uh it made me sad because that's what i wanted to be the most but there's not really cowboys there's cowboys like that there's a ranch hands that's what as close as you can get but uh there's not cowboys you don't get to shoot bad count other people you know they don't allow that anymore even if you have the costume not allowed to shoot people kill me it was one of my dreams god burned asunder another supposed to be a astronaut you know these are all just little things children dream of you know but anyways i was looking and i'm very you know into astronauts and so i was looking at wikipedia i love wikipedia read that oh my god what a it's a great thing because it makes everybody as smart as everybody else that's what i like because i don't know  i didn't go to school you know i didn't go to school but still you know if a guy tells me go hey norm you know anything about astrophysics i go give me ten minutes i'm just go in the other room and then i come back i know more than that  because he learned it 20 years ago but uh that's what i love about wikipedia but i was looking after astronauts and here's an interesting thing um so many people went to the moon 13 people went but i had no idea i was so shocked by that because all i had known was buzz aldrin neil armstrong and michael collins because when i was young i was a little boy my dad was watching on filco tv and he was saying it's real important you gotta watch this and i remember that but none i don't know any other ones that went to the moon there's uh ten other ones so and michael collins by the way didn't actually go to he went to the moon but he didn't step on the moon like all three of them went to the moon right buzz aldrin and neil armstrong they left the lunar capsule and then climbed down a rope ladder and then michael collins he had to stay in the lunar capsule i don't know why but and he was looking out the window you know they're  playing golf and  drive around i'm doing buggies having a grand old time and then they finally went back to the moving capsule and you know they were probably nice people they probably didn't want to make you know mike feel bad you know so they might be like hey guys what was it like on the moon was it cool and everything yeah it's okay there's no earth or anything and i would i prefer the lunar capsule  that at some point michael collins said hey what about if i went down the rope ladder for 10 seconds and then just stood on the moon and they're like no why not no i don't know why  a lot of things people just don't know why not but that's the way it goes but anyway the last astronaut was this guy harrison schmidt and so he has a special place because he was the last man to walk on the moon now i'm sure that he thought he was going to be famous but you know none of us know the name harrison schmidt we know now because you know i'm telling you i'm spreading the word you know as much as i can harrison schmidt but i'm sure when he was on his way to the moon he was like god damn it's going to be a different role harrison people ain't gonna be making fun of me no more i won't be able to buy a  drink in this town   didn't work that way at all maybe he gets free drinks but in a different context you know it's just him in a barley hey bill hey harrison hey do you give me a drink yeah sure harrison come on man tell these guys your story yes sir nice to meet you folks i walked on the moon thank you very much  he looks out the mirror girl the big fat ass things have changed different things are considered you know what's his name caitlin the beautiful considered brave words have different meanings heroic has a different meaning yeah people always go man you know what you know the real heroes are whenever they ask you that question the answer is never the real hero it's all some  other thing there we go you know the real heroes are the soldiers they never remember that so i was like you know the realtors are the teachers you go what the  what are you talking about not the fireman's or nothing no they're the heroes that everybody thinks are heroes the fireman's the policeman but no it's uh it's teachers both my parents were teachers you know my mom is still with us and my dad is not but they were both teachers are both very nice folk you know but nothing heroic about them at all to me the most heroic job in the world is volunteer fireman you hear that job the volunteer fireman because think of that job volunteer fireman it combines incredible danger with complete absence of pay oh yeah yeah it runs into a burning build grabs a kid here you go kid god damn i'm hungry i haven't had a meal in a couple of days what's that oh you forgot your cat oh okay i'll be right back and then a big bean hits the guy and some orange sparkly stuff comes out there and he gets a cat it's like there you go my stomach is kind of bulging it's like they say after you haven't eaten for a while counterintuitively stomach and bigger does that oh your teddy bear yeah no i'll go back listen i think you could try to scrounge up a sandwich that's somebody if they got a sandwich around maybe your parents tell your parents that i saved you then maybe they'd make me a nice sandwich  that to me is a hero a teacher i can't agree with that one because and i and i know what i'm talking about because i i had a lot of teachers i used to be a student a long time ago so i know teachers i've seen them i've met many but not once not ever did i go hey listen barney i'm just thinking i was looking at old man hendrickson up there at the chartboards you know he's erasing the chalk he's writing  now he's racing he's kind of a hero in a way when you think about it the way he tells us what to do all the  time  then we have to do it because we're scared of him seems like i have an easy job to me personally like how many jobs are there where you're ten times bigger than everyone you work i thought   the children that seem to do the bulk of the work you know she was like here 500 words and some  you don't care about it here you go all right see that's your contribution what  yeah other nice nice people and i don't know what qualifications you need like other jobs you have to have you know you have to know what the  you're doing but let's say you're you teach grade five fifth grade you know what qualifications do you need sixth grade education     four years that's what it changed some of the children will be smaller than others like hey look at how many years would it take  when you give them the book don't  them i remember before school man i like school i don't like school one single bit but before school i remember that god that was fun i remember man things were everybody was different that's what i remember all my friends were different from each other and then i went to school and then pretty well everybody was the same i was like what the  happened and then i got to be an adult i was like god damn now everybody's exactly alike but when i was a little everybody different and we were all running around with our bikes and banana seats and  and then i remember like i'd go over to sean k's house right and i down his door i go hey sean i got a stick there you go you got a stick and we go out that'd be the day you know the most fun ever and then and then i remember my mom dragging me to school one day i was crying and everything and then it threw me in a club and they're like this is your desk i'm like ah books oh my god i didn't understand it at all i remember my first week i'm like finally yeah i can get out of the  and then she's like here's some uh homework problems that you have to solve problems and i was like listen teacher i think there's a mistake i'm five years old and i got no problems that's the greatest thing about being fired i don't gotta care in the world i don't got a problem at all i will later on when i get to be your age but now i got no problems then the teaser goes well you got some  problems now you got a whole book of them and you gotta solve them and by the way these problems have all been solved thousands of years ago but  but then my big brother who loved me he taught me a cool very cool trick in the like math homework like it turns out if you decode the the you can crack this the back of the book has the solutions to the problems the problem is they're upside down but once you know that then the math homer becomes a lot easier like uh here's my math homer you know it took 30 seconds yep did they teach you to lie in that four-year  class that's what i didn't like about teachers looking live i mean because the students would always say the truth go hey i'm never going to use any of this  and then the teacher go yes you will  i thought i wasn't gonna use it i was  seven years old and i knew i wasn't going to use this   i knew i wasn't looking to have a protractor in my  house   do you forget that's the other thing you forget it that's like they have that's that's you know they have that show who are you smarter than a fifth grader of course you're smarter than a  fifth grader but you watch the show the fifth grader wins every  time and he's not smarter than you it's  it's because of what he's saying they ask you questions that you learned 30 years ago and this kid learned yesterday so who the  gonna win exactly what's a protractor  but knowing at the time it would have been a  weapon no i wouldn't have killed the president excuse me but you know you went with life and you tried to i just got nothing to say so i said that anyways there's no going back i'll tell you that i realized that very early on i was in grade zero or one that's not zero that's kindergarten but i always called it zero but uh i i i i learned early on because i'd be sitting in class and what do we do now and i looked after my dome there's that stick i can never go back it's only a stick  i could measure it enough sadness it's not sad you know about that thing where they say recovered memory you know like they go you know you could rape when you were five or something and then you repress that memory and then you recover it years later you know like when you're an adult and um and it's a memory that you see it happened and it's always like a violent sexual you know it's never a nice memory you know they're like hey god damn i just forgot a lot of pumpkin pies it's always a horrific  thing for your uncle  you man so what i don't like about i don't like that repressed memory  then this is why because i can tell you and i believe it that i've never been  in the ass for years at a time however i can't tell you with any insurance insurance at all because i could maybe i just forgot so it's about 50 50 really you know if you have any understanding of the rudiments of mathematics you'll know it's about 15. but if i did have that memory i would like to keep it repressed for the rest like you know till i die i don't want to ever recover again you know i don't want to be walking outside with my friend with a cheese sandwich hey listen hey what do you mean yeah cheese sandwich yeah  nothing  i just remember something between the ages of four and eight my uncle  my ass every day all right i'm gonna go live my life now  yeah that works out  i don't think i really believe in recovered memory personally could be true but i feel that if i got raped by my arnold for five years that it wouldn't slip my mind i think it's all i would remember i think like i think i would repress every memory but that one but do you remember why when we watched all the yellow i've never seen that movie yeah when we were kids remember we watched like five times i never seen them heard of it i don't know it was your favorite movie you know i was talking about i'm telling you i had never heard of the movie what about protractor i know at that time i remember my uncle's giant   that probably wasn't that giant you know if i went back now you know man you can't do stuff like that to people yeah you know that's not why we're on this earth that's not why you know you guys just try to do your best to love i learned that when i start  once my  stopped working i learned about love because you know really you know it's all the cell we got you know that's all there is all the rest and stuff is just like you know you know stuff we think will make us happy you know what i mean you go i can buy that hat that'll make me buy a hat wear for a while and then later you go in the closet go where the  is that from did i buy a hat at some point  so we all know you know no we're not stupid we know that there's only love and that's all there is that's all there ever will be that's all we're capable of and we're not even capable of that usually you know you have to you have to try your hardest and uh like i uh i uh try you know but sometimes usually i'm not good and i can't like there's a homeless guy live beside me like you sound like i am home he lived he's in the stream so i walk out every day and i'm gonna walk right fast and homeless again and he's i was like you got a dollar i got i don't got no  dollar and then a dollar if you follow my pocket he's like what about that one i'm like that's for licorice  get a job i hear they're hiring people that shouldn't piss their pants down the street   i'm not going to give you any money just buy a crack with it like since when you get to choose what a  does with this money you give the guy the money it's his money do whatever the  he wants with it you don't get to follow him around just can i buy this beefaroni baby that's why some people i just give a homeless guy food i don't want to buy a crack at you but i tried that before you ever tried to give a homeless guy food you don't want your  food go here homeless macgyver sandwich i live on the cement paper my pillow sound checking out you know what would help me some crap because then i could forget that i've been  up my whole life be happy i could be happy you see what i'm saying sandwich ain't gonna make me happy sorry i don't know where you buy a crack but i'd like to get some and just give it to homeless people go here's some crack you like crack i go god damn are you god  people can't try and give me sandwiches and  thank you sir like that's why i think i like down syndrome people because here's why you don't have what do we want really in life happiness right so but do we have it not often you know what i mean it's like out on the floor and then one time but the rest of time but life is like you know it's just plotting it's like sand and you know saying you're old you know and you're getting older in the sand sand and you've dropped your knees your god damn then you'll find maybe like it's what's in sand fleck of gold you know they go oh that gives you hope keep you going so i see that gold as like happiness you know and i see down syndrome people they just seem to have big nuggets of gold all the time they're happy couldn't be happier and still people piggy i don't understand why he was like look at those dance syndrome people laughing always laughing you know there's no cure for it they'll probably die happy  they don't know the horrors of life that's the problem so just try to love you know when you think about it you think sometimes you think love is real hard like like you know i'm not talking about like scripture where they go love your enemy because you know that takes you know uh you know kind of i don't know how you do that you know i got chopped  that's nobody's like that i don't think but then when you think about you i can't love everybody how can i love everybody but then you look at a dog a dog a dog loves everyone a dog all it is is love it's just like fur and then love and that's how it is like so if a dog could be like that for goodness sakes you know that's why i never understand how people say i like dogs yeah they're always loving me and everything thank you you don't know anything about what i've done he doesn't care i wake up he's right there kissing me hey man i was waiting for you to wake up i love you he's like i love you so much i love you too jamie you're the greatest man wrestling  get the  away  i'll stand here and watch you until you say something again to me and then i'll run over love you again okay yes that's okay that's fine  so if a dad can do it we can do it hitler had a dog think about that people say unconditional love but you know really like if you walked home this is unconditional life if you walk home your wife's blowing eight guys you know you walk home really good sounds like hey honey i love you this condition that's happening it doesn't have anything to do you know people are not capable of that dogs however so there was this dog by the name of blondie love to hitler more than any person in the world he would wake up but where's the hitler he's gone that's god huh well i love

Norm Macdonald,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBjaftUfQi4, mcdonald's oh  this time i came and uh i learned a lot you know um and uh because i didn't eat there last time because i was too afraid  and uh so i ate there before like the first show and it was like around uh hey i know it was like it was like around uh i was just saying i ate over dracula i hit it right before the first show so it was around uh well that may around seven o'clock until about eight i was eating anyways i noticed a very strange thing was happening people were eating enjoying themselves having a good time you know a dracula and uh suddenly man the mood began to change i can't figure out why and then i realized why the sun was going down so people started eating faster there was this couple next to me and the guy's like come on marge i'm telling you you gotta get out of here see and she's like i just have to finish this cheesecake he's going we've been here five times we're pushing our luck as it is it wasn't for my love of transylvanian food because of course people there are all afraid that uh because the thing about dracula's restaurant is you hope that it's just like a cute name that they picked for their restaurant you know and what you really hope is it is not owned by count dracula because he's alive you know he's undead he's never not been alive so uh and he's not a vampire all the time he's gotta  do something to make a living they don't pay you for being a vampire so uh so naturally you're afraid you know but anyways i found out today it's all a bunch of nonsense you know it's just an urban legend but that restaurant is owned by count dracula that's not true it's uh it's owned by a nice couple nice couple it's not a transylvanian food it's just uh some american food it's it's a fred and rose i met the fred and rose dracula their last name was dracula it was fred's idea his father was a restaurateur and uh so anyways i did voice my concerns to him though i said don't anybody you know you're afraid people are going to be worried he's like about what i go you know vampires and   that they'll come to the restaurant they'll be vampires so then fred dracula right he says to me  he said what's a vampire i'm like we're going to say you're telling me your name is dracula and you've never heard of vampires like no one's ever made a joke to you or nothing about you being a vampire he's like no so then now i'm really suspecting he is a  drafter because that's a lie that's a  lie whatever whatever anyway i have pork chops so that's the good side i'm i had to have a good time and the good side was i ate a pork chop but uh it was delicious but uh i'm not really afraid of monsters anymore you know i don't even know what i was thinking now we spend our time you think about it you know when you really look at it for real you know in life and you think what am i afraid of like what am i really afraid of like deep down right deep down inside like what really makes me afraid and then you you're the answer is uh monsters you know but then like when you  stop to think about it for a moment you go are they really that frightening you know a monster like um i think you know that i also hate is when movies like exploit our fears you know our natural fears and then they try to manipulate us by making movies that will you know uh tap into those natural fears like there's this movie out now called the wolf man and that's tapping into our natural fear of wolfman and uh i'm afraid of a wolf man as much as the next guy you know and also a werewolf which is very close to a wolf man think about that i don't know how those monsters are so close but whatever i don't know everything about monsters but i know that you know they're very close and if you've got if you've got uh you know attacked by a werewolf and uh and then later somebody who's like werewolf i think it was a wolf man people wouldn't have that hard that's a half a man and a happy wolf but anyways when you think about it you start to think you go hey should i really be afraid of a werewolf or a wolf man you know sure it's a scary it's a half a man and a half a wolf but i'll tell you something that's twice as scary as that a wolf  will spend our nights feverishly worried about them like we do the werewolves but at least if you're a half a man and when he's a man you can  talk to him not for funny they like money men you know but a  wolf will just eat you that's all they do is whatever and whatever ghosts you know you're supposed to be so  afraid of them and i i was never afraid of them i don't like to say i'm the bravest guy in the world i mean i like saying that but but uh i i've never been afraid of ghosts even as a child i was never afraid i might see them on the tv and everything but for some reason it didn't scare me like other people because to me they're just they come in like ah but first of all they're  invisible like they're transparent you can put your hand through them not something that frightens me about someone you're the guys that scared me you ever see those guys where you  can't put your hands through the phone those guys didn't do your damage you know but it goes like you're like all right whatever you startled me again nice to see you we've lived in the same house for the last two years i'll be hovering over your bed tonight  let's uh and i went to a hotel there was a ghost that said right at the  uh like where you sign in that plus checks checks they had a little sign said there's a ghost lives in the hotel see and her name was mary with the blue dress they had a little like a  thing and uh you think they would put that on then you know and uh so the story with mary is she had been hatcheted someone had hatcheted her years ago you know and uh in the hotel and so she was haunting this hotel you see and uh because she had been hatched into the house i don't know if she was hatched in the actual hotel but you know she could have been hatcheted like in a nearby ditch i said i'm not hot in a  ditch  they had that at a hotel came around there throughout startled people so she went down anyways whatever and uh she never i never saw her she never visited me only so many rooms as the guest clerk told me when i was trying to get a refund and uh she couldn't hover around my bed but anyways mary with the blue dress who i was also got an argument with the uh front desk actually i said i really think her nickname should be mary the ghost that to me i'm saying ladies and is i think her transparency and her being dead is more uh you know more unique to mary  some old blue dress girls complaining ghosts do you even know that i was  carping about something yeah you're like what what the  are you complaining about today what's your story again i got hatchiness oh yeah whatever what was that 300 years ago and they're like oh you don't understand ah i'll never be at peace until uh i have to find a guy or else i'll never be at peace i have to walk through the world oh not at and then you're like well me too you  your big life's a donkey ride to heaven over here looks like there's even walk through walls and  no you do cool things and actually now that i think about even dracula who i'm more afraid of than anybody you think about it you go hey man  i'm afraid of dracula i better get some uh garlic  carry that around just in case and uh and also i will get a two by six and i will hew it first i'll learn how to hue then i will hew it into us into a steak that's spelled s-t-a-k-e and then when i finally see dracula or one of his minions you know then i will place that sharp stick pointed part between his breast bones and with the wooden mallet that i've also hewn i will i will with all my might slam that uh that stake until it breaks through the uh the deadly uh vampire's uh chest cavity or just splits his two ribs and breaks through his heart and smashes that you only have a moment to do it you know it's very tough to do you have to get it right on the right part and if you  up um the vampire will bite your neck and then you will have eternal life it's not that bad when you think it's true it's really nice you know you're not going to lose that much if you kiss you live forever i don't know then we shouldn't even be afraid of vampires now that i think about it then you just go to a vampire's house this would freak him out go hey listen i know you're a vampire i suspected for a long time there's been a lot of time first of all you've lived on this block for 2 000 years let me check the records you know they have a housing regulation but anyways here's the point i know you're a vampire and there's no use trying to hypnotize me with your eyes and all that  on the count i want you to bite my neck did you do that i don't know if and then being a cool vampire ship uh they dress good those look good women love vampires jesus christ man women can't get enough of  vampires but yeah it's like they like bad boys or something they always love vampires all i know is women love vampires like uh like babies love stray dogs it touches them somewhere deep within their soul whatever  but anyways i got so i got the uh what i was gonna say is i got the pork chop at the i gotta i actually have a strand of pork in my teeth as we speak oh interesting side notes then uh whatever so as i do my show you can watch this this will be a little something extra you can see a little subtext as i do my jokes i will also be uh brushing my tongue against this one tooth and trying to get that  strand out of my stomach that's interesting and then i'll eat it that's what i do right now that gross i even myself kind of considered a little gross but until i do it because sometimes it'll take like an hour i'll chew it out and uh it tastes different than the way the pork and i was thinking because this girl i know who is a vegetarian you know which are most vegetarians are girls i guess i like pork and she is a vegetarian you know she only eats the vegetables and i don't know if you've ever uh like suddenly realized that uh the other person's right and you're wrong like have you ever suddenly realized you go hey everything i've ever thought in my life is wrong not everything not everything but just that one thing just one forget when i said everything because that's a whole separate scenario by the way if you ever do wake up and you realize that everything you've ever thought of in life is wrong i don't want to advise you i i you probably should just go down to the rope store at that point and just just buy electro rope because that's not going to get any better by a student it's very important some sort of notebook store you'll need a pant but i think i'm the notebook then you go home and you hang yourself it's funny too people always go you know it's funny to you never wonder what those people are thinking about you never understand why a guy would hang himself because none of us ever have but actually it's pretty easy to understand but uh people one thing i don't understand like people will hang themselves for two different reasons one to escape the worthless sham we call life that part i understand completely the other reason that guys hang themselves is to whack off that's like a newer one the other ones are about the worthless sham of the life that's been going on forever but lately we've come up with a new one another reason to hang yourself but uh and listen i like whacking up as much as the next guy am i a santa here but i've never gone hey man i enjoy whacking up i better be even better if i combined it with my dread of death i could somehow mix those two together then i hear that it makes you orgasm one and a half times more powerful it's worthless but uh anyway cotton food in it so it must be let's do he's a smart guy right he's as a shaolin monk now and that was just the actor that played but my master poe doesn't go that sort followed of off but um walking out is an odd thing i suddenly uh but i forgot about that i had because i ate the pork chop and it occurred to me something occurred to me you know and this is what it was that when you eat at a restaurant it is different than when you eat at home you know i mean like you would never eat at home go hey i made me a pork chop man in my skillet i'm going to cook it up so it's nice and hot on one side now flip it over on the other side i'll flip it over again and uh but while i'm waiting for my pork chop to get nice and hot so i can eat it i think i'll eat a big  loaf of bread i'm getting  slather butter so uh that's not right and i noticed that um that uh another thing it was different was after the dinner the guy came with the dessert now when i was young when i was young when i was young when i was young young people are young and i am old when i was young one time i saw this old guy when i was uh i was like six seven this had nothing to do with  none of it does really it's all much a gibberish but uh like this when i was dying or something i was like eight or nine my dad took me to las vegas nevada i was a little young boy they took me to see this guy danny thomas would you ever hear that guy oh guy he was even an old man when i was a buddy so anyways i went to see him with my dad so his whole life he's like when i was young he was all bad he's like ah things were different so his whole thing long set was how when he was young people his father used to kick him in the pants a lot he'd say pants instead of ass because he said ass hashtags like the other day my daughter was sitting there watching the tv i come in to her and i said you turn that off right now and then she said i'm keeping it on and i didn't do nothing you know hey when i was a kid if i said anything like that my dad would give me a kick in the pants it's not my dad to go goddamn right how does that just sit right so what i'm trying to say is when i was young you were young but i am old but i know what it is to be helping you you do not know what it is to do but when i was young pot was something that you cooked your green beans in my hash was something you make corned beef with it was all it's a simpler time acid was something that uh when somebody uh made it past your wife you'd throw in their face an ecstasy was just a feeling you had it wasn't some sort of now it was a feeling that infused your entire viscera with an enthusiasm you know just ah you felt ecstasy you know usually after you threw that ass in the guys after all he wasn't entirely without false when you think of ours and pass it your wife i was young this was how dessert worked this is what the guy brought me after the porch i grabbed a dessert and in the old days uh when i was a young guy would come up and go hey what do you want for dessert an apple pie or a cherry pie you go i'll have a cherry pie i think i would bring it to you but now it's all different like the guy came today for me the dessert he has a whole tray you know of every confection known to modern bakers is  some people play along they're like oh are you bad man i don't want to do that just like decadent you're why you saying decadent why are you saying these things i'm a felon fellaini fella what's going on here we're still talking about desserts right i end up blowing you in the bathroom or something that's not gonna happen is this i can be tricked as easy as an expo i don't want to be in the  bathroom but hey wait a second never talking about   just reluctantly this computer right thinking in my head oh this is a computer that's real smart computers are super smart and maybe if i have this  computer around right it'll rub off on me i'll look at it a lot i'll get smart myself right so i go there go hey give me your smartest computer way smarter so anyways i get the computer home i turn around i'll be right back turns out the computer is a  filthy animal it's even worse than me it's way worse you've never seen computer pornography i i advise you strongly not to because good lord god once you step over that line pretty well  we're good you know you want to keep some innocent some glimpse of humanity to yourself but at first when you see that computer point you can't if i don't believe what you're saying because you know it's like holy god it's like there's so many women that i'm in another button there's more like this is every woman a  what the  these are pretty women i've never met a lady like this in my life i feel very alienated from everything you don't feel like you're with us but then after a while like everything you know if you watch something enough you get desensitized to it like they say in the big books and what that means is that you know you're watching you're like ah she can only take eight  up her ass why don't you even get in the business if she's gonna be i'll find something else what worst thing can a person do to another person so then you have to you have to go away from it all and cleanse your  mind and soul again so that you could be you know sensitized again you don't have to desensitize the whole time like in the old days they said it was different it was like all completely the opposite because they're like you ever hear they're old guys they go like ah it was sexier back in the movies in the old days and just right now it's all up there in the open for you to see you know it's true there's nothing left to the mystery you know and when i was young why why uh all that what's the name of an old actress huh yes why in the old days why i remember we'd be sitting in the moving picture house and betty davis would show up and mike golly all she'd have to do is show a little of a wrinkle and just arch her eyebrow a little and that was enough that was sexy that was sexier in a way and that seems even grosser you're watching i can't wait till i get home i'll be thinking about that later and i'm  you you're it's ridiculous but anyways forget that i want to say i do want to say about the uh about this girl this time of the vegetarian because i forgot to say this that she told me right that she told me that um that every uh uh uh thanksgiving she will make a a turkey but instead of using a turkey she would fashion the countenance of a turkey out of this stuff called tofu and with the tofu make it into the image of a turkey then eat it which surprised me on a kind of um that's the thing she didn't want to eat in the first place was a  turkey what she think what she doing like me i'm against cannibalism you know that right never occurred to me to take all my delicious cheese sandwiches and make them into a  rotting old guy's pork  yeah i'm glad you clapped man because i'm proud there's things in my life that are important to me and one is to spread the message of cannibalism and listen i believe that the the education really is the only way so what i do is and you can look this all up on the  ww google  you'll see that i do a lot of benefits and all that  for anti-campbell's and what i do mostly though i love to work with the children in the school so i go to school i go to schools across this great nation and i tell the kids i go listen you know uh if you think it's cool to eat some  guy i think that's gonna make you a cool guy at school you know i mean it will for a while yeah there's a bad part to it you know whatever i realized that uh standing up on stage talking into a mic and acting like a  isn't enough in life so i've taken on these these uh what do you call them benefits or good things what are you doing whatever charities all that  because before that i'll admit to you like other than my charity work i'm an i'm a rather empty individual like  i travel around the country because i do stand up comedy see so i go from town to town to town i do actually do two things i'm a stand-up comedian plus a lot of people don't know about this about me i'm a dangerous drifter  so i got like my hobby and my work like a dovetail perfectly sometimes sometimes it's hard because i'll be in a town you know and a cop will be eyeballing me you know and i won't know i'll go maybe he knows me from being a comedian or something you know or one of my  shows i was on or maybe he knows me from that time i drifted into town a couple years ago and all that fire has happened i can never tell so uh so you know he'll sidle up to me and i can't tell because he'll go like you're just wondering what are you what are you doing in town like i'm working over in a cap city there fella named vic you can ask him you can ask him yourself maybe i will maybe i will at that but uh target but listen  when i say  by the way i am talking about people with down syndrome i am not talking about this because i think if you're a dumb guy i want to call you a  that would be an insult did you have a retirement but uh  i feel quite comfortable calling for retail but uh i actually like retards people uh i would be happy you know what i would like to have a friend that was a  because they're they have something they've acquired something in their clutchy little grasps but the rest of us eludes the rest of us somehow and that is a couple of drops of happiness they seem happy don't they when you talk to them doesn't a  all this thing happen and my god what we what would we give for that you know all our fortune you know we would give for happiness for goodness sakes so i feel that if i got a  friend you know then that would rub off on you but it's it's hard to get  friends because it turns out their parents are very protective we're not talking about a child we're talking about an adult  i don't know i feel because i i have a hard time like getting that happiness and i just said whatever i might be opposite i'm happy for such a s seldom just like when i wake up sometimes i wake up like this here and then i go oh pillow i see my pillow you know and i'm happy  and under the door comes light and stuff comes in but also under my door what what will come up and creep onto me my life it comes up my life comes all over what the  the  is that what are you doing for holy   bananas never looked at it that way i'd be happy thanks enough of that i want to talk about my charity work because i'm not really here to talk about  jokes and all that  like i think that's important to appoint jokes and ah  but really what we really should try to do is charity benefits for the with our and listen like one of them i like popular ones like cannibalism for instance pretty popular um i uh land mines you know about land mines this is a very serious issue i don't like to talk about it much but uh what a land mine is is it's they put them underneath the earth if you can't see them and then guys step on them and they blow up a terrible thing what's going on all over the place and one of our great champions of the cause i've been in the anti-land mine crusade for some time we lost one of our great champions in the crusade a couple days ago or something it was princess diana the princess of england and she was a princess she lived in a castle but she was much more than that because she would go around and she would really fight the landmine people because she was against landmines so was that we had this in common and uh then she of course uh tragically uh something happened she died everybody was sad and then ellen john wrote a song about her that she you wrote for another lady earlier i don't know why the royal family wasn't unhappy about that this is under a time crunch ellie how you doing with that uh thing you got that sign for uh you know princess diana what  no yeah i was meaning to get a yes i did write it here it is i changed some of the words a little bit a little bit it's a little bit it's a little bit the same looks like exactly the same well i was thinking uh you know marilyn monroe oh and she died live her life remember how she lived her life like a candle in the wind and i was like yes of course i remember that she lived her life she was out crazy man doing all kinds of pills and everything and so such a vulnerable wayfish spirit to her while she was in the grinding mechanism of a hollywood that just crushed her nap or she lived your life like a can on the wind they could at any point extinguish you know and then then john's like yes exactly but what does that have to do with princess diana well she also she lives her life like a candle in the wind she's she's in a castle you know and uh she wakes up then a butler comes in well it's not quite the same but thanks a lot she was the woman probably least like a candle in the wind of all of us i'd say if we pulled all of us in this room our life would be more like a candle in the wind than princess diana the princess of england but anyways the point is this i have taken up with a great uh enthusiasm and energy the anti-landmine uh crusade and i'm quite proud of this you know and uh i go and i do my protests and i go i have one of those uh i got a stick with a  cardboard thing on it that says stuff about how bad landmines and what's good with a very popular cause like that we have a lot of people behind us you know is that uh you don't often see a counter protest because that's what you don't want when you go go to a protest you don't want to see the counter protesters you don't want to clash you know and there's always a couple of guys land mines yeah you know you know but they're kind of kooky or they're uh they're in the you know you know they're in the probably in the pockets of the landmine companies you know  i don't mean to get a little bill hicks on your anger but listen i'm going to be serious here if you think the landmine companies in this country care about you  you're a little guy all they care about is their third quarter profits whatever that means no seriously i don't want to  break your bubble right yeah but all the landmine  companies are interested in you is if you blow up on one of their landings every time you step on a piece of grass that you think is grasping is actually a hidden landmine and you blow up it's only in their pocket you can't be that naive here couldn't work you got the tv don't you but uh what oh my god i don't even know what i'm hammering about now so uh anyways what else i i've uh established that i'm against cannibalism i believe and uh unless this is an interesting thing about cannibalism you're this you're you think you're you know very anti-cannibal until it comes up and then it's a whole different thing it's easy you know to have these limousine liberal beliefs that have bad cannibalism when there's plenty of delicious cheese sandwiches to be had but what about the people that aren't in our uh our lucky situation you know what about the people who happen to be uh uh stranded in the uh andes the andes mountain range how about those guys they have to really uh make their cannibal decision very carefully because i don't know why but i don't i would see personally i don't want to test my cannibalism uh beliefs that strongly i don't i don't want to go to the antes i'll never book anything that's uh on the other side of the andes like i know some people will do it on purpose they'll go they go listen i'm looking for a place the wife of ruth and i remember ruth from last year she uh was uh thinking we've got to get away from the kids and she was thinking we'd go to a nice island somewhere with hamlocks and something on the other side of the andes do you have anything on the uh directly that we'd have to directly cross the uh the andes just you have a small plane we don't like big planes ruth enjoys small planes and in the dead of winter she does when she likes to fly can we go then so then you get in the airplane and of course you instantly crash into a mountain and everybody knows it there's no secret to it i think it's written on your boarding passes way over a mountain and so then you crash you have to wrestle with your conscience because you know the there's guys to eat you can eat and uh i think everybody wrestles with their conscience that you know i don't think there's maybe there's one guy that goes hey i'm gonna  start eating people right away i'm gonna eat that  at 42 and everybody else was wrestling with their conscience and then by the time they decide to eat this is one fat guy special bones everywhere  but that's not what happens people people struggle they wrestle with their conscience you know for a long time before they decide to finally you know eat the guy in 24e and i don't know if you've ever wrestled with your conscience before but it's a it's a you know it's something that's i don't know man uh it's hard to wrestle well you know it's harder to wrestle than your conscience if you think about it if you had the choice don't wrestle a professional wrestler that's the toughest thing to wrestle i think is a professional wrestling there's no struggles that's it no you gotta wrestle with your conscience and then well the point is finally if i get too hungry if i can eat the guy because days have turned into weeks have turned into months to turn yeah yeah time works uh yes then becomes now and then so you  decide to eat the guy in 20 40. but now you're so ravenously hungry because you haven't eaten you're like and hot dogs and cheese sandwiches everything went down in a minute ago there's all right but i was going to uh i was going to say i was going to tell you one thing about about how weird whacking off is i just feel i should tell you because i was thinking about it when you're whacking out and stuff right it's  weird because you got to construct in your head a thing that's not happening you know because what's happening realize you're whacking up that in your thought bubble legit it's not you whacking out and you're thoughtful no guy could ever do that once  the rest of us you know pedestrians you know we have to construct something in our head yeah so it's you and i'm just having guys i don't know about women because i'm not a woman i can't speak but sometimes i've asked when i go hey when you do that what do you think of and then they go the wind but guys work on the idea of being a lady in their thought bubble uh and it's it requires an enormous amount obviously of a self-delusion that you can actually you know even paranoid schizophrenics have trouble coming to the point of actually achieving uh orgasm over uh some imaginary event but um and i don't have a huge imagination like some guys can like whack off to like uh like victoria's secrets or what kind of playboy or something like that but i i can't do that it doesn't work i don't know why it's always the same thing like i'm like yeah i'm like hey there victoria secrets lady hang over here and take your underpants off i'll give you some what no you don't want to okay come back why would you yeah something like that underpants comments so i can't sustain the disbelief in that however the girl that works in the 7-eleven three blocks from my uh apartment the fat girl you know her name is marjorie and one time uh six months ago i got a bag of sour cream and onion chips and she's like i like sour cream onion chips too but she looked at me like in a weird way i'm like i'm like that's different man you know i've talked to people about chips and  before like i was both like the same technician but believe me there's something else going on here you guys have a sense of this right so anyways the point of it is marjorie i in my mind i  her all the time when i'm whacking up and she knows nothing of it and i would never want her to know so if you ever bump into a don't tell her you know this is the place i go to get my supplies my 7-eleven stuff you know so i don't want to complicate the issue i know i'm withholding i'm not lying as a normal thing and then my belt bubble all this crazy  and i memorized her face from that time when she said she liked the sour cream chips because it didn't look like that brother i got a very specific look to it thanks i use that face a lot and then so i can strut this crazy thing in my head and that wagon up but then the weird thing is that after it's over it's all gone you know it's all it just drifts away and you realize the unreality of it but the time you're like ah you're like hey how are you doing there marjorie come on man i seem to give you a couple hours out there huh you know the 7-eleven is that right huh what are you  high over here sometimes i mean i don't know why i mean i was like the sweetest girl i would never talk to you like that in real life so i don't know why i like that because i'm i'm most genuinely toward order in real life anyways and now i feel like you're doing anything treat her any way i want because it's in my thought bubbling and i'm like ah hey go get a friend of yours it's a different race then she goes away but the the horrible moment is right after because you're with all these girls you're like oh this crazy stuff and then it's over here there were no women it's just me alone i'm getting a hold of myself here hey and just relax here it's all right just make sure that's all nothing wrong with that i'll sleep that's it i'll get some sleep that's the answer sleep sleep is usually the answer by the way that's what i found most of life's problems sleep that's why i don't want to die because i like dreaming i gotta sleep and dream it and i hear that once you die but that's my favorite part because you know things that are so painful in life and everything you know like uh everything in life just seems like you know it's got a lot of pain in it right but then when you dream way more horrible things happen to you in your dream than in your real life but you don't feel the pain it's perfect yeah i mean like you'll be going dude we do and a  bear starts chasing like oh there and uh and then you're like hey here's my dad who's been dead six years how you doing you're having a conversation with your dead father and then that's crazy  so in real life that would be a full day of being terrified and you're doing actually move on to other things like well i talked to my dad father for a while and that bear ate my leg what's next it's i don't know i i just know shawn nicole you know but uh it's cool because uh one day i myself am a christian everybody has got some  religion and uh um i find lately whenever i tell somebody i'm a christian they think they look like a  like when i was young everybody'd be a christian so it didn't matter you just go just be what type of person were you going what are you gonna go i'm a lutheran you go are you  i'm an anglican but now it's not in vogue and i think people sometimes do with christianity because i don't know like i like the scriptures you know they're cool to read and fun stuff but sometimes people get like mixed up between christianity which is just a book and stuff to read you know that's cool jesus cool yeah can't get much cooler than that dude even if you're not christian if you meant that guy though i kind of like him i seem like a nice fella but but uh but but i think sometimes people get like confused like instead of focusing on jesus they'll go i sad god didn't like them like feel like an evangelist you know that's not really like you know the spokesman for christianity the spokesman is christ jesus christ of nazareth and so if just because a guy's got a tv show where he's got a bible it doesn't mean he's necessarily a spokesman for my my belief you know what i mean and sometimes i watch sunday morning shows because i like hearing scripture and then sometimes i'm telling you man i've seen shows whole hours these  they don't even read one scripture they're even having a  bible there's a bible like on the desk a lot of times it's just they're building something a lot of times they'll just be a guy wanting money he's standing from a big  thing he's like we're building this thing but john it's we didn't mean to expensive this is a giant church the biggest church ever anyways we're broke again you don't have a lot of money here can you send us some money to build this thing you know i don't wanna look at those commercials you see those commercials one of those it's gotta be when you get commercials where you're uh you're the old guy in the commercial you know you're the old guy like like i said leave majors like you know he's a six million dollar man that  when i was young when i was young it was a six million dollar event now he does these commercials for a thing called it's called the bionic ear right it's just him in a chair he's like i haven't here too good at it as a bionic man bionic ear and you're like i don't think it's the real one i think it's just a hearing aid the bionic ear you can hear it about portugal i remember that episode  don't hear too good out of this one let's do that you couldn't just not come back on tv their commercial they're doing is for old people that are gonna die and they don't have no insurance they're so  old that they forgot so i don't know what the  but so ed demanded for a while then he died you know somebody else doesn't and so i was like hey listen does nobody want to insure you because you're so  old and sick and everything are you in your death bed right now anyways you never thought of getting insurance huh but what about your family i got a barrier for god's sake how about this join our thing and we'll take care of everything and it's a dollar a year  we don't make a lot of money it was never it was never a good idea i worry about my check  clearing know you're old when you're doing that you think about dying a lot like me something runs through my mind day and night survivors of my death some commercials what about commercials that those commercials are so self-evident that they're like i said this is a real popular commercial now you see all the time some guy comes out and goes hey you ever think of buying gold you're like yeah yes they're valuable historically gold has always been worth a lot of money yeah you knew that already yes i watched jackie jack when i was young gold is worth a lot of money what the  well of course it's not very funny no i'll tell you this instead  that one i was thinking that women i think that women are the superior gender and i'll tell you what   gender is simply because they can create life you know and and what men what can we do either grilled cheese sandwiches creating life what can we do that could possibly compare that and uh i think it's amazing now a woman can can actually create life and all she needs is like a like a dollop of pump and she can actual that wasn't funny  but either way can actually create life like everybody makes fun of the optima and stuff like that but to me i think that's the most unbelievable thing you could do in life is create it and uh if i was a woman i would be holding that over a guy's heads all the time and i'd be at parties i go hey fred what are you working on now well i worked down at edgar's bank uh there marjorie yeah yeah i'll tell you what i'm working on there fred is that i'm creating life right now human life is the highest form of life i'm creating it as we speak actually i created it twice already so i know it's probably gonna work but hey listen you know what's weird a foot just kicked me that i created i created a foot earlier and now it's kicking me i don't know if that's ironic about because i don't know what ironic means what is it you do again at edgar's bank marjorie i work for c and uh that's interesting frank listen i also want to tell you why i created life because it's not as selfish as you might think you know it's not just me trying to what i want to do is i want to propagate the whirling cinder we call earth with grandchildren's grandchildren's grandchildren of mine so that they can lush to the pros of pushkin as i do i don't think i'm doing it for posterity is what i'm trying to say frank what about you again because listen well the upshot of it is this marjorie i bring papers into mr edgar's office at the end of the day stack of papers by yay bid then i go away for 20 minutes and i come back and old man anchors he's got less papers for me from the papers that i give them that's all i can tell you margaret now they told me there'd be sandwiches at this party that's what a fella said you said that it had sandwiches that are kept and they cut the crusts up and then the triangles which the only toothpick so that's what that man said margie  it doesn't have a sharp like ending  sometimes things don't work out perfectly which you guys don't have because whatever you've got fine coca-cola some places you should have coca-cola everywhere you know it's the best you go and you'll go hey can i have a coke and they go uh no i bought pepsi oh yeah  because i think i think people think that if coke is your favorite drink which it is for me that pepsi would be your second favorite but it's not true pepsi is your least favorite  that's something i've got root beer well that h i guess i could pick a root beer but anything else like what about sierra mist you're like i was gonna ask i was too afraid to ask guys i didn't dare ask because i thought you'd say no that's my favorite beverage sierra missed i'll be in the  restaurant with the wife and they'll get the swordfish and they say what do you want to drink i said sierra mist so we don't get that i go  this joint i've got a hen house horseshit honey get your coat and i'll pull around the car listen if i could say one thing about the real heroes of the uh country which i believe are the teachers you know um i don't really i don't believe they're really i actually i think the real heroes are the real heroes teachers they get good press though because people often see me you know the real heroes eyes are they're real heroes they go no no they're the teachers it's counterintuitive that it doesn't seem like a heroic job but yes first of all if you're a teacher you get the same kind of vacations as a child like four months a year my vacation i get almost no timeout over 48 weeks a year like four weeks a year i get out what about you i'm not one of those  teachers right  it's always easy to ask the questions real heroes are other  students  so you need a grade 13 education  you're not the real hero right now it's a fun thing to say but what do you do what do you do for a living that your wife's the real hero what you bet you know you're not the actual real hero don't you look obsessed can you see how upset she is so you actually feel you're the real hero yeah i think you've destroyed yourself a little because i believe real heroes don't think they are  he says when you hear the real heroes they go how the  did you run into that  fire and pull a guy out you're a hero and they go now it's the teachers not me  everybody's shorter than you are worth it they have to do whatever the  you said i'd work for a school teacher  people that were teaching our young  suggested they actually  more students than  if you can believe this than three  actual priests who i know i'm not uh i'm not uh i'm not a catholic but um i know pastors you know and my god they most of them that i know do the lord's working on you they go out and they're in hospitals and stuff and they're doing stuff and for no money you know no recognition and it's got to kill them like going yeah people think  kids like if i was a priest man i just let me know like i i do a tv commercial i go hey listen i'm father norm here right now of my church i won't  your kid i'll tell you what that's the first thing i promise you i'll tell you a little something about myself my father norma's 20 years or so ago i took a vow of chastity now what that means is i cannot have sex with a lady you know now that's tough because i like ladies and especially the ones you ever see those ones where they uh press their tits together kind of little cleavage they look kind of horry but it looks like they don't know their  anyway that's my type everybody has their own but i will not  your kid and you believe your big ted horror wife at home i don't need that hanging around chunky you gotta admit though the guy that put that flag in the iwo jima he's close he didn't know that when he got there the  spacecraft would crash or there would be moon aliens  i know he's not i know it's not grade 11 biology  imagine any  other  job you know hey i'm the civil servant i'm a hero  memorize this  you're back tomorrow and then you gotta tell it to me i remember everything i say i got some problems for you i know you're a child and that you don't have any problems that's the cool thing about being a child but guess what you  got something listen guys do you teach newton isaac newton you know what do you return  why is it very smart  a treadmill have i seen one wait i don't even get it it's not good when people are groaning and i don't understand it no have i have i ever seen a treadmill yes of course you mean the things you walk on you remind   it's a thing you walk on and then right you're not what you wouldn't be sure that i'd seen a treadmill well you see this you're probably very bad at grading people  for me to lie about that now i've seen dozens hundreds happen i want to brag  i see treadmills what about those songs what about these stickers yeah is that like country signs and  and uh and people go oh man country that  kind of you know it's about dogs dying and you're losing your car and all that  you gotta be drunk and i'm like why isn't that well life seems real to me whereas other things seem fake like rock you never rock and roll like i do leo the woman broke my heart i can't and then you see like a hundred women in the eyes how did these guys get their heartbreak i can't get knows like why don't you nick jagger if you can't get sassy what the  am i supposed to do but uh uh  mick jagger can't get satisfaction is there any hope for uh pepe the arthritic busboy although even country music although i love it you know like sometimes like so many sounds that like um you know like what gets me what always makes me sad and crying country music my favorite song this is where there's an old guy in a bar drinking the  and it's on account of a ladybug and there's a poor old guy sitting at the bar and his new home is the honky tonk and uh it always gets me but then when i think about it realistically if i went into a bar and i said hey there was that guy at the end of the day i mean that's drinking over there and the guy said oh that's earl a woman left it back in 62 what the  i gotta go talk to earl you know i mean girl what's the matter uh she left me you know you know i think the problem now earl's not as much to the lady as the alcohol itself it's about the booze   oh i haven't seen five absolutely what about this other song by allan johnson he's like uh i guess that's why they call it the blues he was angry the whole time these are minor complaints  i can take them such blessings listen life is filled with blessings you know the uh you know prayers go up like like water you know evaporating up into the to the heavens and then sometimes unanswered prayers fall down upon your face like uh when they sting on them  i don't know much listen i don't know much but i do know this man you gotta you know you gotta love each other and uh yeah you gotta uh yeah try not to kill anybody yeah you gotta try to read try not to rape anyone i don't live good live a good life or you're chilling right you know because i don't have the uh desire to rape and also i don't really think i could i don't think i have trouble enough with the when i lay down on top of the ladies just getting through and that's when they light me you know they like me and even then it's not easy for me but if i had a lady that was trying to scratch my eyes out and  didn't like me at all i'm not cut out for rape now i know that because one time i had this girl you know how if you're a guy and a girl says she hey he likes him then you pretend you like it she was like yeah she's like i bet i know how you like it i'm like how's that she's like you like that rough i'm like yeah but i don't know yeah because i was afraid she'd run away so i got her bag in my place holy cow wrestling earlier  my heart's racing i don't do this anymore it seems wrong even though you're giving me consent to rape you yourself what if you call the police that keeps going through my mind as well that if this is somehow on a transcript it won't look good the italics will not come out  god bless all of you
Norm Macdonald,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16hH8v3Xcu4,directly if you got a person saying that our country is the greatest like let's say a guy who knows Kenny is the greatest country in the world not entirely guys from Kenya pretty well so you Olympus says see the Summer Olympics Canada sucks it was it was an Olympics and it broke in some lady had won first for a shot at God in life targeted this is the only really important for it in all Olympics this year and see I don't know I've just yeah the Olympics aren't really well sometimes I do but you know like this Forest except on the Olympics you know what I mean like nobody watches that  but you know like whatever it is like a hobby horse but then it's not bad on your internet once every four years you know and all of a sudden you're an expert you're like 8.5 what kind of  horse   oh my God everybody's excited about swimming yeah I need to see a water and then a bunch of like  two good sports by themselves that's right combine them make another sport like I saw one a guy Run 100 yard dash and then uh fish that's very excited in a creek we gotta watch real fast yeah  that's right you know this guy's probably getting like uh guys your breath to 25 minute mile they said they could never do that yeah come in last you know I mean everybody said oh sure they got it first that's a good story but I was backing that last you know like and I was trying to watch that guy keep your eye on that guy because like let's say they're doing the 400 right now the guy at some point he realizes he's gonna laughs so he's running around I wonder if I just got anything and I was like holy God I'm Gonna Last I'll never catch that second last guy at this point I practice every day for four years till dawn to come in and come in last I didn't have to train it all I could have got that roast chicken I gotta get more trigger Hearts I only got so much sadness and I can't get it for before that I know sometimes I hate it I get very sad that I'm not sad enough if there's if I turn on TV a big earthquake listen guys Haiti and uh and also your kids there I don't understand what's hard for me to be sad about places I can't even imagine and then they tell me I'm supposed to be scared of stuff that to me doesn't seem scary Iran yeah yeah I'm scared but not really not really um or something like that be the guy the worst  you ever met and then people will defend the guy like by saying his name oh yeah yeah that's just Sam what's up everybody now we got a weekend you know we can't be worried about all these little you know North Korea Iran so yeah we got a band together and it's the time now where we gotta get the world with the forest it's raining you know all of this is raining in the forests and you know one thing you know everybody yesterday but right but science   thing they didn't know  either like science you hey man the Sun goes around the earth right and science is big they gave them a white coat and everything learning the famous man Wikipedia  meanwhile the earth goes around the sun which I know ever return  at the time of course values right just like right now they think they're right though like I would not be surprised at all if like that for 200 years from now scientists were going God damn it's but we burn down that look at the rainforests oh even if it's true like yes the girls been around I don't know how old the world still fine still good 49. I'm gonna you know live to be 30 years more I didn't want to tell you that but it's a bad news for the doctor years is gonna  not have a good meme  oh yeah people trying to save me a guy in the clipboard oh girl I don't know a lot about the world but to me just from Elena's perspective the world to me seems like a big round ball of dirt  than that because I have a hard time like I know it's science mostly I've been cut in half and they show it to you different fresh ers  two but just from you know just for personal experience so someday take a shovel out and see what the world the world really is it's a bunch of dirt I don't care how Loop you're not gonna find anything you don't even get hotter the point is this also you know I don't know she said 30 years ago they just go by and then a whisper of an eyelash you know so the thing is that I don't want to spend time crunching cans and putting them in a thing I got an orange garbage I don't want to be on my deathbed and then go first of all I should never got a death to death  like religious people are like everybody but no no no no no they don't understand you're worse than the whole point that you're no good don't get it you'll never be nowhere  you never learn you know what I mean you look at Christian like I'm a Christian I still eat apples I only got the Macintosh yeah everything I know it's red delicious how can I make that today what about the other Red Apple you know what I mean like you guys we went so we decided to put a sticker on I don't have to say wrong that they'd be ready to go home and they all know that they're really good  now I do know his Macintosh was a guy who lived down yeah  bill was the kind of man he lived the life you know it's rather Vanessa I mean my name is Jan he had hopes and dreams like oh but he let them go and he lived their life mostly in business but it never made a foot from any store when you would ask people who he was people couldn't remember his name and then he felt sick you know after a while then I did I said to him bills you have any regrets and he said the only only regrets  thank you so now what'd you get out of life  I tell you what I found a change in my life many many but I missed the the guy of a child's nose anyway I have to be choked my black vinyl now all right all right oh wow don't you think that when people go to the Apple store and they see your apple red delicious they will automatically infer that our red apples are an activists facilities like a lot of times I I think that my imminent death  I'm feeling today sometimes it feels weird and then I go oh because symptoms the thing about a symptom his environment symptoms  the symptom like you you know the symptom if you have indigestion that's a symptom of a massive heart attack but it's also the symptom of indigestion so you know what the  you you don't want to go to 911  so you just die at home perfectly good digestion but listen man either the world is becoming very Progressive and beautiful or it's going to hell in a hand faster I can't tell which but uh there's this lady Caitlyn beautiful lady Caitlyn Jenner she's so beautiful around beautiful  and I find uh her timing could have been worse because uh I uh I have a m of an age whereas when I was a boy they had the Olympics in 76 and uh she won oh the uh decathlon she was the greatest athlete the greatest athlete in the world in 1976 was a lady of anything so that would have been a great moment for the feminist movement if you know they put their gold medal around and I was like by the way I'm the lady foreign I  would only do it under certain very certain circumstances but uh because that's one thing I was thinking I I suck at  basketball men's basketball women's basketball that'd probably be a pretty good like sixth woman first line computers I'm six two Giants and they couldn't stop me because I'm a woman see when I was young you know I I would say that my mother said I was doing my father listen I'm a lady you know and my father don't reach out but you got a cop down ignorant we were back in laughs  we found back then having a cotton in herself  anyway it's nice down to have a choice and uh and I thought about time when I would have a choices here's the thing let's say something came from my past because we all have secrets in our family and I'm not uh I'm not uh listen I'll tell you I'll tell you our secrets with my God um I one time I'm guilty of one well one real serious crime many you know sins but the one of legal crime which is the crime of manslaughter a long time ago and I what you don't need to know all the details but the gist of the thing was I slaughtered it man  and  and I was like God damn I've slaughtered a manner before me oh slaughtered to hell and uh I didn't know at that time that man star is actually less of a crime than murder because it's way worse in real life oh but anyway should that ever come up if I should uh you know the way the comic got on stage and added Cosby maybe one time a comic they'll come out on stage and ask me maybe it'll be me maybe I just do and uh they look and they you know you guys that's a joke but then somebody goes looked at that and they go to a certain place and find a slaughtered man long since slaughtered man with my DNA all over him stuff to imagine forever  um the point is if I was if I went to jail the judge said you have been convicted of manslaughter but because the jury found that you slaughtered that man have you anything to say for yourself then I would say yes I only have one thing to say I am a lady I know you're not a lady and I go you  biggest right there you said that I think I am a lady and I should know more than anybody who would not worry if I'm a lady you know some judges I'm sorry for me a lady now ship me out to Lee's jail  get me over there  all right the uh the girls just kind of show me on YouTube apparently they have gender re-classification surgery if you watch and I said I'd rather watch  Isis video it's in its infancy that uh particular procedure  even most of the people that turned into ladies go I'm keeping my  that's the other thing about the whole thing God and the lady with a cop what the  is that and I'm a lesbian huh foreign   those things   all right listen I don't pretend to understand just an old chunk of whole trying to figure out life you know there are things about time especially as you get old you know the snow gets a little deeper steps gotta might stick foreign    for breakfast with your egg out of the diner I said something yeah sooner I fellow space when he danced with your wife that's just the Ecstasy it's just a feeling yeah excuse you this is an excitement through that acid Harris county is Dancing with my life now what's his name Caitlyn the beautiful Caitlin is considered Brave words have different meanings heroic has a different meaning yeah man you know what you're the real heroes are whenever they had asked you that question the answer is never the real hero so how's that  other thing and over there you're the real heroes there are the soldiers they don't remember that so I was like you know the real ears are the teachers you know what the  are you talking about not the fireman's another they're the heroes that everybody thinks they're Heroes fireman the policemen but no it's uh that's the teachers and both my experience with teachers you know my my mom is still with us and my dad is not but they were both users are both very nice folk you know but nothing heroic about it at all to me the most heroic job in the world is volunteer fireman you hear that John the volunteer Finance think of that job volunteer fireman it combines incredible Danger with complete absence of pay but again it runs into a burning bill grabs again orange sparkly stuff it's like there you go oh my stomach is kind of bulging they say after you haven't eaten for a while counterintuitively stomach and bigger what's that oh you're a teddy bear yeah I know I'll go back listen I think you could try to scrounge up a sandwich they have your parents tell your parents that I saved you that and then maybe they're making a nice scent  imagine me as a hero teacher can't agree with that one because and I and I know where I'm down but because I I had a lot of teachers I used to be a student so I know teachers I've seen it once not ever did I go Hey listen Barney I'm just thinking I was looking at old man Hendrickson up there at the chalkboards you know he's erased on the track which is right now he's amazing he's kind of a hero in a way what do you think about it the way he tells us what to do all the  time then we had to do it because we're scared of him is that kind of an easy job easy job like how many jobs are there where you're 10 times bigger than everyone you work   is any Hero at all in the deal I I would say it would be the children simply dude bulk of the work she was like here 500 Words of them  you don't care about it there you go all right let's see that's your contribution what  oh that's nice I don't know what qualifications like other jobs you have to have you know you have to know what the  you're doing but let's say you're you teach grade five to fifth grade you know what qualifications do you need sixth grade education    that's overqualified I don't know what the  you're talking about  40 years that's gonna change some of the children will be smaller than others they have African how many years would it take  if I could say one thing about the real heroes of the uh concert which I believe are the teachers you know um I don't really I don't believe there's really that's it I just spoke again I actually I think the real heroes are the real heroes teachers they get good Preston because people often save me you know the real Hero's eyes are they the real heroes oh they're the teachers  it's counter-intuitive that it doesn't seem like a heroic job but yes   first of all if you're a teacher you get the same  vacations as a child like four months a year we're 48 weeks a year four weeks a year what about you no one of those  teachers right right right away okay that would work great that's uh easy when it's the other way around it's always easy to ask the questions real heroes are the  students   nice as well so you need a great 13 education  guys around here you look up sense so you actually feel you're the real hero yeah I think you're just wrong inspired yourself a little like please don't think they are  the real hero sorry I'm trying to be a good person you're still working I try not to do bad things you know what I mean that's right well I guess everybody proud about that even people do bad things but I think they are I guess I Bill Cosby he didn't look like he do he did anything  people are going to be here I think he'll perform again but I think he might I think they assume will he perform and talk about raping ladies that I don't think he'll ever do because he's a very clean comedian Zach would never touch on the vile subject material but he could be just like I go into the courtroom and I'm sitting beside Camille now the man says we are ready to begin this is not going well Camille then the prosecuted maternity shows much papers on which ladies names and there's a 148 ladies and Camille says that's only the A's I said this is my lawyer told me the longer the jury is retired the better it is for you so the jury goes to retire I go to take the sip from my drink before the glass has touched my lips the jury is back come here what if I saw that song I had the greatest Bill Cosby story ever and now it's not in the tub ten thousand people because you're not going to believe this Bill Cosby they rape you or not forget about it forget it it is because you go in and uh you know I get worried all the time  and because I'm of an age where like for instance not a day goes by that I don't check the status of my left arm a lot of my days a little bit weird 911 okay what the  like my arm hurts my left arms my left okay well same to you fella you gotta follow them after you have the massive heart attack you know you're like yeah remember me you used to have a half the heart yeah well I was right yes I'm using my last few moments on Earth to say you killed me but I don't like regular Baggers because you know all they do is send it a Specialists like why can't I if my foot hurts how come I can't go to a  foot doctor oh God hey is this the foot doctor yeah listen my foot hurts can I get a a dog to see it you want your foot doctors you gotta go to a regular doctor what's he gonna do well he'll send you over here  to him what is a regular doctor ever even do they take your blood pressure I've had my blood pressure taken probably 10 000 times you know you never get worried all right it feels fun because you're like Superman or whatever but the guy's like that you're 140 over five so it was that good they I don't even know  now I'm gonna strike your knee with a hammer from the cartoons you're still doing that  what does that ever  proven helped anybody they hit your knee with a hammer yeah it's like Excellence yes exactly how you should react when someone hits you in the name of the camera yeah I remember when today was used their smartness to tricky you know because they know bigger words in here so one time over there God damn dog I don't know man I got something where I'm always tired the guy's like Sally you got chronic fatigues he's like well crying means always but gee it means you get tired syndrome that means uh something you got anyways I like how they check for cancer you know here you go okay I think cancer is that stupid belly cancer hides where everything hides up your ass that's where the rare Jewels for expensive narcotics your hands are going to high because they all payroll everybody's gonna look at my guys she's  ass no ass doctor that turns out there is that stuff thank God for them and at first you know I was a little suspicious because about the hatchback but I'll say that when I first went because I because I know there's that time in medical school where you have to choose your you know specialty that's it and so the guy the head died he's like all right listen to me doctor students and I will tell you there's many things you can do we'll start with the top hey how about a brain surgery imagine imagine having that's a synonym for intelligence itself the brain is the Central and Europe well what is it Fred I think so yes I wanted to ask the question about the brain surgery yeah yeah what is it uh look at the guy's ass  there's a hurt surgeon oh hey how about the hurt for years poet submitted akin to the very Soul what's up imagine that god-like feeling

down is that before or after you look out the guy's   it's not true you mean a guy you're in Paris or something you go hey I'm from Madison Wisconsin oh small world but it doesn't happen you know it's usually like uh hey uh I'm from Mass Wisconsin what about you I'm from here France wow so the giant Globe we live on   it I gotta get myself together nobody likes likes the planes of course I get afraid I get scared you know you know I try to do the best that I can oh here's the thing I listen I I don't I haven't  oxygen auction yourself first and then put it on your little child and I was like that was my plan though I don't want everybody and uh but here's the great thing what I always do I sit in the exit room and it's fantastic because you get like a lot of extra labeling and all you have to do to sit in the exit row is to lie  environment the stewardess comes or the you know used to go whatever we used to go the ladies uh the airplane stewardesses they're reflected as if they're a lady the restorative and if they were a man well you know oh yeah so it was a bad time  how's everybody so hateful is all when you have any  War right so to me that gives them a pass whatever the   I got like an 18 year old kid telling me I'm like yeah my dad's like a bag no  uh thousands of these he was 50 when he had a man World War II this guy's 18 what the  what the  am I gonna learn from 18 year old yeah 12 years ago that  was six suddenly he got opinions  everybody got opinions I don't know what happened anyway so I'm on the airplane and that's what so you're sitting is what happens you sit in the and then the steward of the flight attendants in case of a you know explosion and everything and the white and black okay racing down a few so I asked you foreign       but anyways of course in real life I've been  one I'd get out before my mother yeah    but listen I don't know about I don't I think it's telling you all this  so that you'll be a little calmer on the airplane because if the airplane does go down and that  stuff or what is it the cushion works in the float you ever  crash in the Pacific but everybody's cool they're floating around hopefully they listen to me   also if you scratch at that velocity they're like dematerialized you know what I'm saying you're like your assets here stop I would say at that point you're a bunch of stuff they find full ER have you ever seen pictures playing wreckage but you can look at it and never see a body it was a suitcase here and there and they show the whole picture one  person  because you're stuck ashes  and uh started recording the scriptures but uh crash now then they call it remains  freestyle  because victims relative ly want the remains I don't know why but it's a big thing closure you know what I mean they're at home they're like chat    going on oh they do may they find your eyes you go look at this Norm man weigh 190 pounds all right shovel 100 nice job today now Greg Norman   gets an excellent the normal right hey I don't remember having three eyeballs  I don't want to talk about it you can do some things to try to avoid things like for instance like trying to avoid flying over the Andes whatever you do  for some reason you survived so that you can grapple with cannibalism you know it's a nice little  trick they do you know and so then you're up on the goddamn and now I'm against cannibalism but if you know anything about me a person you'll know you know check out my  web and all that  I am again I talk about it everywhere not here he's a bully profit and I refuse to use it I'd get people when they're young like you guys you've already had your beliefs on cannibalism I'm not gonna change your mind I get the young people to high school I go to high schools I go to high schools and classes this great continent from Mexico I don't want to go to Mexico  across this great time behind the youngsters you know about cannibalism and mostly I let them know I go you know that's not cool you know a while you're going to be looking  guy people will be talking about you but the old CV  see sometimes I think oh I'm on my home I'm against cannabis but  that's because it's never been put to test so I avoid the Andes because I don't want I don't want to be put to the test of my beliefs all right man I'm in the shaky yeah now let's suppose I live in a world and it's the greatest possible country and the greatest of all possible worlds and there's always two sandwiches around so uh in person now Andy's they don't have two sandwiches vending machine if you want to make a  fortune you just go to the hand and just put up a  engine but they don't have it so I I try to stay away from them and then people crash and then there's something to Grapple with this moral issue whether they're gonna consume a fellow human being you know consume a fellow man and of course at the end people yeah they always break and do it  I've been late too long and then there's mad with Hunger so they just rip into the co-pilot that's what I've heard  I'm talking about nutritionist but someone told me grazing is small it's a small portion of co-pilot and then I watched but that's why you should know what you believe so you don't have to make up your moral compass you don't have to set your moral compass under these situations you should know before you even get on a plane like I know like if I'm on an airplane and there's any turbulence at all immediately I'll go I'm eating that  at 4f guy in first class I seen him when I walked by and looked delicious and then I would find that guy  drag him behind a Snowman oh getting hungry I'm like yeah me too in a way crap  the funny thing is you know now all these books are coming out of what why he won you know what I mean because because it kind of surprised everybody and now it's like Trump nation of how it why did they what on her I remember someone  all right  I am I you know I'm a simple man but I had a little um Epiphany one night I was like I don't know if this is but think about this yes Donald Trump won but he's the only guy running you know a lady ran against him for the first time American history and what a great  timing that was experiments she actually wrote a book and uh you know they say don't judge a book by its cover Hillary's book not only can you judge it by its cover you have to read it like it's just a cover the cover itself says Erin this is the cover I walked by a Serena guy I look in the window of the bookstore and I saw it and this is what the cover said it said what happened Hillary Rodham Clinton hello and now she's not aware because that's what it was I don't care what anybody says  people people said we hate Hillary so much is that burning raw red hatred we hate her so much you know what we're gonna vote for somebody we hate more than her to rub it in you're so  guys funny hair Don King is that what a  take a picture John McCain and Donald Trump remind me of the same guy by the way I do an impression of Don King would you like to hear my impersonator yeah all right here it is this is Don King you know Don King if he lived in Japan so instead of living in America Japan okay so here it is we're only in Japan y'all only the  guy this guy I met this burger that's so Charming all you say is your name and it's like a compliment you know what I mean like I meant he's like not McDonald's and you feel good oh yeah but she was not Charming when I first this is what happened let's say this is a quick story so I'm doing David Letterman right so this is my  comedic idea I say uh it was for uh one of my shows I think it was the new Norm Macdonald show and uh so I was uh I was uh different and so um I said oh here's an idea I'll go and I'll I said to David Letterman I said here's my idea I'll go and I'll pretend that I don't want to uh promote uh the show because it's kind of embarrassing I'll say you know my man is always telling me to promote but you know why doesn't he promote and here he is and then the Nationals Don King that was the joke so says he'll do it because he'll do it foreign I thought this guy was the most Charming guy in the world and then I met him in this little room and oh I don't know if you've ever sensed evil but uh and uh he was no life he's like crossed his hand he had all his jewelry and children and didn't look at me and then there were always Nation of Islam God nothing nothing to make you feel more comfortable than nine Nation of Islam guys they were all standing behind him and then I go oh  abandoned this and uh I go here's the thing I was thinking you know I'd say I contended a modest and  and then you come out and you go hey there's a hand like who are you I'm like I'm not McDonald's and then he says all right I said hey I because I'm going up against the show there's a show at the time called 60 minutes too it was a 16 minutes it was on Sunday and then 60 minutes two  so uh so I say to Don King I go hey uh uh I think it'd be funny if I said oh uh don you're saying how good I am but remember I got this tough competition what about 60 minutes too what's 60 minutes so I just want to get the  out and uh it's just a program you know and that's the returns about the nation of his life that is before computers as I find out about it I'm like but you don't have to and now we can just abandon the whole idea you know he's like so I've LED around  so scared of a petrified because he doesn't know me he doesn't know the idea nothing you know and also he just fixed a fight so Letterman was angry on it so let everybody want to have my eyes out let him enhance me but I'm afraid not to have them on because I'm afraid it'll murder me or have to be murdered and so he why doesn't he promote me and here he is my manager Don King and so don Kingdom though his two little American place that's those  crazy net he does that stuff where he just says now I will leave America only Norm Macdonald and David Letterman y'all David Letterman no McDonald's mechanic David Lemon America and he takes a takes a a Canadian and and only in America and everybody's a  called cheering on nuts so I'm scared you know and she said you know the play of mine for RSS it's nice to say Don but remember we have a competition you know like we have uh 60 minutes too but anyway six minutes two he goes let me ask you a question I have six friends two does that have Mike Wallace and stuff 60 Minutes To Have and they're running it doesn't have anything you got six minutes two I call it 60 Minutes of who only in America the upcoming election hey what about this upcoming election though it's going to be a serious thing seriously you know there's going to be a lot of people that want to be president you know and they're going to be trying to get us to vote for them to be the president of the United States and uh and you're going to be asked it's a scary time for me because this is where you really those opinions are going to come out people are going to be asking you your opinion you know and you got to have an opinion nowadays I don't know if you've noticed this but uh when I was a kid people who have like seven eight opinions like tops know some more about food  you're expecting to have an opinion about every single thing that's ever happened or will happen or might happen and so so you'll see where election starts the commercials will be targeting the people that are very smart you know what I mean they're very smart people on one side the very smart people on the other side and they'll try to get those people cemented up you know so uh the commercials will be very difficult I remember this from the last election will be the same this time like a guy will come on and you know he'll say or a lady I say that a lot yeah listen um if you uh if you want to know my answers to uh climate change as as well as the immigration crisis as well as unemployment and prison reform then you should go on my uh on my website where I have a 35 page position paper explaining all my issues and then I go oh no not going to do that listen is like a fine NFL and all that but here's the thing I am not going to read your position paper on account of a guy told me earlier today that uh I just have the one life after choices are to be I also have two seasons of Matlock can't be read because they're too complicated for me you know what I mean I I don't know I don't know ask the smart guy that wrote a book about it don't ask me you know and I know a lot of people don't know because a lot of times you watch a CNN or something like that right and they'll have a pool and I have a question and the question will be very difficult be like do you believe the Sea of Japan and its many encounters uh perch the GNP and then I asked you that question then it goes at the end of the half hour we will show you tell you what the results are and then they show at the end they show a pie chart with the results and that's cool it looks like a pie you know and uh so there's the pie chart and then wedges of pie it shows the the answers and it's always like 45 yes 45 no 10 I don't know so then I feel good about myself am I that's 10 10 doesn't sound like a lot but this is this is a big country you know and so that's 30 40 million people you know depending on if the country has 300 or 400 million that's a great number of people and I'm I'm not ungraded he's one of those people and I want I always answer those polls you know because I want my voice heard sucker for those polls every time I see him I finally go hello yes yes is this the TV okay listen to me now you asked me a question earlier and uh listen man I don't know all right I'll be honest with you but hey I got a question for you how about this what did that second word mean huh what's that now how about that all right anyway I better end up on that  pie chart I'll tell you that I'm no sap  the I don't know is you notice usually too the the yes and the no are always almost equal that's what's weird about this country I mean I don't know that's why when it comes to end of the election suddenly I don't know vote it becomes very important and  it's like the elections tomorrow and they go we got to get those guys that haven't made up their minds yet even though it's been a year and a half and they don't  know they're still but we get them and uh it's kind of a weird way to choose the leader of the Free World a bunch of guys like me that don't know  in my hand but there you have it then the the commercials are no longer about 35 pages because then they're trying to get guys like me they make it very simple very easy for us to understand you know like a personal Commando yes um let me ask you this question do you like Green the color green and I go yeah  rice I like you anyway well so is this guy who's a guy thank you and I'm like really get the  out of here come and see this guy on the TV finally a guy you know I'm talking about how cool green is all the time of  there's a guy that has me speaking to me proof Ruth  that's what I read you know how they say you have a uh your brain behind your brain that kind of oh that's true subconscious or unconscious whatever yeah you don't know which one it is there's one of them so you got your regular brain up here that adds add together so you know how much there's another brand behind you don't even know what to use my  uh celebrity I mean like for instance my kid he's a  I put him in a return College hey a return kick and go to a  Harvard what foreign   I shouldn't say  you know I got Ashley in a little bit of trouble I I don't forget what happened I think I got in trouble for not seeing a  I tried to change I said uh website reader I said Down syndrome that was worse I don't know dude but it is Tina context it'd be important so I yes I would use the word  but here's the context here's what I would say I love retards so how on Earth could that be pejorative and I honestly do I always have a I live in L.A I'm in an apartment four Apartments down for me uh lives a a man and a wife and their 19 year old son a  I wanted this guy to be my best friend this 19 year old kid and the parents didn't go for it I wonder why such a cynical world you know what I mean like yeah that's my attack a  19 year old retired  that's who I want to  the reason that I love retards the reason that I envy the people that other the city is because Richards are happy everyone I ever see is happy and isn't that what we want it's not what we probably one in life isn't that happiness you know what I mean and I'm some you know sometimes happy but not like I'm not a  happy that's right again there was a injection of  juice I take it happiness that's what I'm looking for and then that's not too much I remember one time I went to Frontier Land This is the first place I have a fake bank and guys are  the sheriff and the guy runs out of the Green Bay stop his black bird all this  right there is a Sciences would you like to be a uh my opinion for gold I go God damn right I would me and my my brother right so this Old Prospector comments the guy's not an old person and uh he's like hey there Fellers you know whatever and uh we get there he goes yeah you look at you are you do you think you're gonna find some of the uh some of the gold and I'm like God damn you live down the street I know who you are stop with that  so anyways uh we we've had I don't know if you've ever had for girls so they put you in front of a trough and it's water sand with water or anything like this here right yeah and uh through the screen the water comes out and then you're left with sand so then five minutes turns to ten minutes ten minutes 20 minutes 20 minutes you know how time works but after a while you're like hey prospector I've been panning for a long looking time and it's a sand and so anyways finally I remember this it was a it was into the second hour maybe they have a one hour turn my brother seen something she sees something we don't even know to this day we talk about it and it was like just a shadow of a glister of something that we took to be gold and we were filled with such except such happiness and that's what I think happiness is I think in real life that's how often happiness occurs most of life is  sadness  oh what's that what's up wow retards I was like walking around big gold  bars I don't know I just I cannot understand I can't understand people and I envy what is to pity you know there'll be like four retards back and then two guys ago like look at him over there laughing they don't understand the horrors of life that's the problem that's the problem when you get down to it  for cure they'll probably die laughing like that they'll probably die happy think about that for a second I'll tell you what I like man because I don't know a lot of stuff man never got a good education on that stuff but it used to be I couldn't like like when I was talking to somebody right I would have to it's hard to talk to people one-on-one like in a party because like my friend said it's really easy Norm all you have to do is listen to the person you know and that's true you do it I'm excellent at that that's my best thing it's just listening to the other person talk but eventually the guy stops talking and you're like oh I forgot to think of something to say I'll tell you what you keep talking and then the next time you stop I'll have something to say so what you have to do is two things at once yes you listen to the guy but if he says anything that you have any knowledge of right you keep that in your head right like a guy gets maybe he's talking about Star Trek or something hey wait a second I know something about Star Trek since this  stop time I'll say that cruel Factor you know about Star Trek excellent dearly  do so this is your piece  somehow a guy had changed the subject you ever have that and he goes that anyways the thing went to Panama Canal no wait listen now hold on here it's very interesting what you are saying now but uh but what about um then remember then about Star Trek and uh I just put in mind I think that I wanted to let you know um we all know about uh of course Captain Shatner and uh Dr Spock you know  what a lot of people don't understand what they don't know is that the Starship that they drove around in space was not actually called the Star Trek let's go the Enterprise okay you're talking a while now again also also thanks to this year which I I don't have to show you I could have just told you the magic phone I uh it's great because it democratizes knowledge knowledge and power that's what somebody said once now if you have all the knowledge of the world in your pocket right here you know so I can talk to anyone now they can bring up anything you know what I mean they go out I don't know if uh you know the uh the actor Robert Carradine you know of course I know the maximum Robert charity and I gotta go to the bathroom  your conversation I go yes I was just thinking about Robert Carradine and you know what I like about him first of all he was an American actor foreign  but here's the thing I would never do and because I think even if uh and of course there is no God we know that but even though I know there's no God right why would I try to get someone else to be in that belief that's amazing like it's not a sin because there's no such thing as a sin it seems like it's like a pretty bad thing to do you know what I mean just because you're smart and they're not you know you're supposed to go excuse me over there yes you the glister of Hope in your eyes come over here I want to tell you something seriously it's all meaningless when you're born you get sick and then you die and you put dirt on you anyways you want to come over to my house and talk all this  day with me and my friends about it that's all we do I have a podcast would you like to do that did it feel to you I would never do that never do that like a lot of people go hey why do Christians have to shut everything down everybody's throat you know it's because it says that in the Bible you know to go and tell other people so they can you know have from Heaven too but nobody wants to like you know you like to be invited to a party again you know you know  don't do it I just take the risk you know if he was up to me I wouldn't care like my version of Heaven would be I'd be up in heaven and I'd watch all my friends getting raped by the devil really fun for me but you got to do your best you know and God I did not mean to be preaching boy if it comes the opposite I apologize completely I hate pretty cheap people when it comes to their religion all I'm trying to say is if you want to get into heaven you have to go through Jesus Christ  consider that  it's funny with the The Ten Commandments because they seem so arbitrary you know like some of them seem easy right like Thou shalt not kill come on man you can get through life without killing some  because that may be such a great person yeah I didn't kill anybody yeah come on in answer your  eternal life your word you didn't kill anybody but then there's other more nuanced ones that are very difficult like this is one that always you know I could be oh how can I not covet like it's just so in I don't know how to escape the human bonds of covetousness but the Commandment says Thou shalt not covet Thy Neighbor is Fox okay first of all this don't have eyes so there's if I'm gonna have to hook on that one meanwhile what about me I got it right I love this Mexican it doesn't matter what race he will but the point is I shouldn't again cheat I should have got a new ox  Ley can hold ox and  and then he's got like a hump on his shoulders I'm like oh what the  is some of the mess guys like what the  ing he's got bursitis oh my gosh it's like yeah like Nixon I'm like Nick what  all day and I can't do anything about it because there's that other uh commandment thou shall not kill Ed so I can't like you know kill my fox and be stuck with it so now now I leave my house right and I walk down to the corner store and my neighbor his garage door is open what a surprise and what's in his garage just the most beautiful like lustrous I don't know the coats are like  a little blue  hold your knots  it was like you like it I'm like no I got my eye see it like marks now listen man I like the news you guys like the news  hey always watching this and I'll tell you something about the news I don't understand it but it's the for some reason I watch it I don't even know why but uh I think I'm supposed to or something so I'll watch it and then the guy will come on he'll go hey anyways today the deficit and I'll go I've heard that word foreign index is uh down and then I go that's not good damn oh I like when it's up that's my opinion on the seems like there's too much news like you know because now they have 24-hour news now when I was a young boy the news was half a hour that was the whole news you know and a guy would come on and he'd have a tie you know and  and he would say the news and it was a half a hour long now it's 24 hours long now it turns out that back in the old days when it was only half an hour they had it about right that's about all the news there is  there'd always be like a story for them  story at the end but a caribou or some horseshit so there wasn't even enough to fill the half am but 24 hours way too long so they have to keep repeating stories all the time and everything and they'll make up stories you know they do that a lot of makeup things that aren't really news stories but they have to you know fill the 24 hours you know and the one I noticed that they make up a lot this is the latest one I've seen I see this all the time on the news the news man will come on he'll go he'll go good evening everybody this is the news man whatever he says he's not gonna say it there he goes our top story tonight A lady has vanished story and then he goes let's go outside where there's another guy so then they cut the outside and there's a guy outside and he's like Hey listen how's it going inside we're outside and uh we found out about this lady that vanished her name was Janice and they found her car here in the Taco Bell parking lot and uh don't worry about the car it's fine but uh can't find hiding her hair the lady oh back to you so then you're watching you go well I don't give a  on account I never knew Janice in the first place matter of fact I'm kind of happy it's Janice and not somebody I know but then what they do is they start telling you about Janice you know and they go hey we got found out some cool things about Janice you're like no that's cool I don't want to hear it they go no you want to do they can't help themselves so they go let's go back to Bill he's uh he's still outside and uh how's it going Bill and Bill's like it's all right there's no inside but it's cool and uh anyways we found out about Janice turns out she's a good lady and uh we found some friends of hers and here they are and then sure enough they show a lady and it says friend of Janice and uh she says I'll tell you something about jazz you want to hear about Janice Janice is the type of lady that you could always turn to you know you ever want to turn to somebody like if you got a problem or something yeah yeah you feel like you want to turn here we do that or maybe your neck just hurts and you want anyways the point of it is that once you've swivel your head over this way the person you'd most want to see in your eye line would be Janus and then they have another friend of Janice that wasn't the first one and she'll go I'll tell you Janice oh my God she was the type of lady that she could walk into a room and light up the whole room you know I shouldn't have a  light or not like that she would just somehow through sheer tyranny of will she could somehow illuminate a room I don't know and that'd be Janice's third friend lady that's not one of the earlier two and then she goes I'll tell you about Janice is that who you're asking about James Janice was the type of lady that you could be talking to your best friend in the whole world and then Janice come in you go  you I'm talking to Janice  because Janice is better than you come on let's face it is better than all of us so anyways then you're at home and you start liking Janice you know what I mean you start getting invest in there you go God damn that Janice is cool lady I would like to meet her one day that would be a lot of  I forgot she vanished ah just my luck they'll find her then you get hope that's not good I don't give a  what Obama says hope is never good don't try it it never works out so you go you go oh man they'll find Janice they're putting pictures up of her on telephone poles I think that had worked once and and then the news keeps showing you more things about Janice you know and they'll show you like the video home videos of her you're like God damn look at that she's eating a pizza I like her hair like that they'll find her and then you become obsessed with jazz it's all you can think of you know you're at work  just can't wait to get home agonizing over Janice you know thinking about her with eating pizza and  and then you go home and your Knights are just a fevered dreams of you know Janice and bangs and  like that and and you all you can do is turn on the TV and I'm hoping you know and then one day you know they go hey more news on Janice it was the Billy still has that and then bill is like outside and he's like here we are uh where as you can see behind me they are scouring the woods they're still searching for Janice you know and then you go oh  not the woods nothing good ever happens in the woods I've seen enough of these  stories to know that Janice ain't coming bounding Out of the Woods anytime soon it's like hey what's going on everybody I just taken a stroll through the woods what are you taking my picture for I decided took a stroll through the scraggly Woods no they find you in the woods they always find you in the same place every time they will find you in a shallow grave foreign just look there in the first place that's if I was a police chief I go listen I want every shallow grave in the vicinity checked out I want to clear out this case by Tuesday and I kind of I'm running for D.A or whatever that's uh doesn't shallow grave SEMA might rash you know like these serial killers are supposed to be so shrewd and cunning and everything you know at least they're going to the TV movies I've seen and uh but then when it comes time for the grave they get a little Hasty you know oh there you go three twigs and a leaf that ought to do it that doesn't look like Janus anymore I don't recall Janice ever wearing three leaves and a twin oh well The Authority is there God prepare these things you know you have to be a little smarter than that you know what I would do and I would never ever kill a Lady In Cold Blood  I win I know I say that now I don't really know I can't predict the future but I don't believe I know there's no River long enough doesn't contain a Bend but I believe that right now there might just be vanity I don't think I would uh I would kill a woman but if I did I would plan it out very carefully you know because there's a land at stake you know you think about it you're probably you know probably lose your job I don't know what happened blemish on the old CV you know even in today's enlightened Society there remains a stigma to being a psychosexual sadist but uh what I would do is I would like I would look at the Lee I would select a lady and then I would follow her habits you understand what I'm saying like I would watch her very carefully you know I go hey I noticed that every day she goes that cheese sandwich shop and then she comes out with a little paper bag a big thing there's a cheese sandwiches in there yeah say I keep that in my head you understand and I say hey I noticed every Wednesday evening she goes with her other lady friends and they go down to the YWCA and they play basketball with each other which is fine nowadays yeah so what I would do is on Wednesday I would go down to the YWCA and what would I be uh holding in my right hand in the parking lot but a cheese sandwich so then she would eventually come out of the YWCA you know how sweaty with her uh you know her ridiculous three colored ball and everything there you know and I understand and then she go hey what's in your right hand I go nothing I'd be coy you know there she go she's gonna stop in your right hand I go listen lady who knows more but what's in their right hand you or me I believe oh this now this is just a cheese sandwich why you like it for something once I got a whole  van full of them over there right over there thank you yeah that craziest looking  van you ever saw it's filled with cheese sandwiches you don't have to have cheese sandwiches in the van by the way unless you want to be known for your detailed work it's not it's not really necessary then I would get the lady in the van and I would drive her to a remote area an area most known forever it's remoteness that's what I would look like and anyways I'd take her to the remote area where I constructed a shed and then I would get her in there and I would do that thing that makes me feel like God and uh and then her screams would just bounce off the walls and Echo out into nowhere and never touch the ear of civilized man again and then I would take her body to the woods and bury her in a very very very deep grave 
Norm Macdonald,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGISZ8hzu0A,i deposited 300 but i clearly have written down that i deposited 350. good luck with that jack who wants to see the main event please welcome to the stage one of the greats gentlemen i've ever known norman jane mcdonald  it would have been really depressing if he hadn't gone through that last time um hey guys how you feeling all right everybody oh yeah me too i flew in uh uh  having this thing with going from uh l.a to anybody from l.a and anybody go to la vegas yeah it sucks that  a flight because it's a lot of turbulence you know and so i flew it for a long time it was and then there was these terminals that scared the  off i said from now on i'm not gonna ever fly just dry i don't drive but just get driven you know so i get a buddy of mine to drive me from la to vegas which is the most dangerous  thing of all time so you're driving and you know it's six hours and you're behind a  truckload of trembling logs in front of 19 hours and uh you got to go i hope i  survived this past and then but here's the most frightening  part for any of you who have ever driven that you know you're driving and then you see the tire marks going into the desert like that but there's never any coming out of the vegan desert oh luckily it's a it's a what's called an extra-long cigarette king size king sack so anyways i love being in vegas because i'm a  degenerate gambler and  are so evil they pay me in chips  cocksucker's so evil they pay me in one ship you ever hear like just a snippet of a conversation and it tells you everything you need to know just from that one little snippet you know my friends i'll give you an example like one time i was walking beside these these two homeless guys right on the street and one homeless guy says the other he goes when the  were you ever a goaltender for the montreal canadiens  but anyways uh i'm in the elevator now here's the thing a lot of people go to vegas and they go they come with a system you know they're gonna break the bank they're gonna they're gonna beat the casino you know so they figure out a system and believe it or not some of these systems actually don't work at all so what i think i saw just or heard rather for my little snippet was the unravel of a system because i get in the elevator and in the elevator is a man and a woman and a whole bunch of tension so uh so then the elevator starts going down with the four of us and uh suddenly out of nowhere the man just snaps at the woman and goes uh i don't give a  what i said give me the money  it's my money i work hard for that money so i feel he was calling an audible on his system he was going to change his system to betting whatever he had left on red and then return to the system i've got red that's what i did today it's not much of a story really this is how irrational though you are as a camera i go to the roulette table right i put 200 on red the  thing spins and the ball lands on black and i say  i almost picked this  and everybody at the table understood you know anything about the game of rules  that's funny when you're in the middle of the night right now and then i double it then i triple it when i lose and i lose again um but i do love las vegas uh i did fly it was a lot of turbulence it's a little thing called jet suite if you guys ever want to fly it goes from burbank to  la vegas i mean uh costs 120 bucks right it's a private jet it's 120 but i mean it's not like super fancy but 30 people and uh 120 why am i telling you this this is more informational but yeah i get a little scared of those little  uh airplanes because when little airplanes crash they make the newspaper they're so common that they don't even  it's like on the scroll like underneath now when the big jets go down wow here's a little trick with the big the big jets if you get on one of these big big airplanes always sit in the emergency exit row because you get a lot of extra leg room and all you have to do to get to sit in those seats is uh is lie so uh the stewardess will come up to you or knockouts i'm sorry they're flight attendants yeah be very careful with words but i'm from a different time you know when i was young if you were a flight attendant and you were a lady we called you a stewardess and if you're a flight attendant you were a man we called you a uh you know a steward you  man i should i should walk off this stage and discuss what's hard with words you know i mean i mean everybody can be anything nowadays you know and uh i remember my kid was little you know i told him i said you would be anything you want dylan and he said i want to be seven feet and i said ah let me rephrase that you can be one of five things but yeah when i was a kid when i was young i remember one time i went up to my dad right and i said dad i think i'm a little girl and he said he said to me he said i thought he had a  to show how hateful we were back then now my dad was not completely hateful you know he fought hitler people are accomplished he had his good side he fought hitler but he had his evil side where he thought having a  had something to do with being a boy it's hard for us to even fathom such an idea   because i gotta not walk  but why why is it i have to believe  just cause some person believes some   yeah i mean i guess trying but it was clearly a lady so the man says to me because i'm christian the man says to me how can you believe in a an invisible man in the sky i go well i believe you're a  man  shouldn't she have to believe what i say how dare you say jesus christ how dare you  ignorant anyways that's the old me i got my woke jokes i wrote them on my magic phone i just started today  but nothing funnier than woke jokes nobody gets hurt nobody laughs god damn it where are my  excellent woke jokes  you i can't turn my goddamn you know that whatever i have notes on my magic phone and i write them down but maybe i could just remember it off the top of my head here it is first of all with woke jokes you got to remember one thing they're not funny but they're important and they're sad with a great deal of either anger or you know so here it is um hey listen i don't know what's happening to us as americans but there's some things that are happening they're wrong and not who we are as americans now you take the southern border and what's happening at the southern border well that is not who we are as america you know you may not know this but there at the southern world right now today there are children as young as two or three years old that are being separated from the people that bought them from the parents or the cartel or whatever and and the kid gets through and then the cartel guy can't get through and it deals a deal  it's not who we are as americans ripped from the arms  i don't i don't think they do that every time by the way you know what journalists usually just say and then they take the and that's like  is that a baby in your heart rip that baby out and then we'll throw it over there actually what any  believes happens that's another thing i'm not supposed to say i i got in trouble said  but anyway i can't trust everything like uh i said  man so anyway i got this reviewer guy all mad at me so  norm said  he goes uh and then the reviewer said i mean this just shows how uh stupid norm is and then i said to myself hey what about the stupid people it's not their fault they're stupid this guy's insulting all stupid people i guess you're allowed to insult stupid people unless they're real stupid they're retards i don't care you tell me the rules and i'll do my best and context means something right apparently not like i remember when i said  my act because i remember the joke and here was the context you tell me if this makes any difference the context of me using the word  was i love retards is that hate speech can that possibly be defined as hate speech i said that because the reason is i do love recharge and and i also use the word  because it's just i know what it means it means arrested and your development sometimes  stop slow down you know i could say down syndrome but then i'd be worried people think i'm a  doctor or something and they'd want me to hit their knee with a hammer or something i don't got time for that  by the way why do they still do that we're targeted are you go to a doctor and he goes okay i'm gonna hear your name with a hammer now you're like okay excellent good idea then he hits your knee with a hammer like i have my knee and he's like excellent he writes it down and he's a vampire that's exactly how you're supposed to react when struck on the knee by a hammer good good good you're now you're not paralyzed that's good we're gonna just check that one so that's why i don't say down center i might say return so but i love retards and this is the reason i had a a  to live three three um i live in an apartment so three apartments away from me there was this  he was and he was like 22 years old lived with his parents and i was trying to become his friend and his parents wanted nothing to do with that for obvious reasons   what i wanted is i thought some of his happiness would wear out because see retards are happy that's why i envy them so much that's why i love them i mean god damn if there was a like a like an injection of  juice i could take in a second because it's happiness that's all we want what do we want other than to be happy and how often are we happy you know once or twice i mean not in your life but you know like like i'm happy when i wake up i think it's because that's when there's all the hope you know what i mean i think that's where i'm happiest i wake up i'm like yeah god damn i'm glad i bought that tempurpedic pillow that was the best purchase of my life but then that doesn't last long because the light comes in and then you know kind of your life comes in and it gets all over you like a  spider web or something like well you ever look at the mirror i'm not talking physically i mean like like late at night or something you have you turn the light on you look in the mirror  well became of me i used to be a nice thug and at that point i'd like to have a  friend and he'd go hey i like bananas like oh yeah me too goddamn i never thought of it that way man they're yellow you're  right there yellow what do you say we go buy a  banana right now me and you happiness man that's hard i remember this is what i think of happiness i remember when i was a kid i went to frontier land god damn it was the coolest place at a bank and like a  a sheriff would come out with a bank robbery and this year there'd be a guy in that voice the sheriff clayton's coming you know and he commented he was the coolest thing and there was this old prospector uh except he was mr becker from down the street or whatever he was pretending to be an old prospector so uh he said hey elders hell would you like to pay for gold and uh we're like sure becker yeah and uh so we go and i don't know if you've ever panned for gold but it's a it's a it's a bunch of uh sort of sand in water right and a trough of water so and then you take a thing you're going this year you know for about 20 minutes and at the end you have a bunch of sand and uh they're like what the  hey becker let's press the goal i know no keep going so you  like forever and finally there's the shadow of a blister of a  some gold looking thing and then you're thrilled you're like ah ah gold you're like daffy duck gold that's how i look on life that most of life sand once in a while a little gold but most of your life is like you walk through sandy damn this  sand hey what's that oh it's a little piece of gold hey i'm happy meanwhile retards are running around big bars of gold in their hands skipping down a golden road with golden clouds in the sky and all their golden friends so i think it's the people that are against me on retards that really are don't like retards because they pity them and what what worse thing you can do to a person and pity them you know what a what a ugly thing to do to a person i envy returns i see them pity you know i'll see people looking before retards you know standing there would be guys looking at him god look at them laughing over there it's a damn shame they don't understand the horrors of life that's the problem you know what the most tragic thing is there's no cure for it they'll probably die i love me my  where's my recharge tonight  kathy griffin's got her gaze i got my retards hey i don't know where the  we started talking about that bears in the airplane i was uh flying and you don't have those uh oh i was saying about the idea i was talking about the emergency accident because the stewardess that's where we all got into this mess in the first place the stewardess or the i mean the flight attendant comes to you and the flight attendant says to you uh listen in case the plane crashes and uh you know a flood of gray black smoke races down the fuselage towards your lungs would you mind letting everyone else out before you and then you say yes i will do that funny thing is i was going to ask you if i could do that that's the funny thing before you asked me i was gonna ask you because i feel it's well worth the extra inch and a half of legroom meanwhile in real life i'd be  kicking my own mother right yeah before full life goddammit i used to be on tv what the  i could try first here's the thing also that airplane right that when that crashes when the plane crashes i feel that that window may change locations like it it might no longer be right beside you after the thousand mile an hour collision or whatever the  it is i know it goes down fast and hard i was listening to the you know you listen to those warnings and i guess i don't i just block my ears to them because i've heard them so often but there's one i'm sure you guys have all heard but for some reason i missed it it says if you're if the oxygen mask comes down they go if the master mask comes out be sure to put it on your own face before you put it on the face of your little child and i was like god damn that was my plan you have to blab it to everybody but anyway i think it's just to make you feel better because you know the things they tell you you know they go by the way in case of a big crash don't forget that your seat cushion is also a boat the  believes that you go hey honey i'm very gonna be cheap at the cottage this year i just bought us five boats and of course that never have you ever hear  uh hey you turn on the news hey a plane crash in the pacific but don't worry everybody floating around on their  boats they listen to the lady everything's cool everything's fine everything's you know you have no chance if a plane crashes right think about this you ever see a plane crash they take pictures of it videos they don't care and that's because you never see a body in a plane crash and that's because the speed vaporizes everything so that there's nothing that even resembles a human being it's just a whole bunch of uh just i don't know it's stuff it's a stuff that's what it is it's a plain load of stuff they go in they go yeah there's a lot of stuff in this  plane and then uh the loved ones of the victims they want the stuff they don't call it stuff they call it remains it's a nice word for stuff ashes hashes stuff to stuff they want the remains you know and i understand that you know what i mean like they go oh god man i can't get to sleep because my my first born mitchell i love him so much i can't i can't even get to sleep because i keep thinking of his final minutes on that airplane and if only i could see his remains get a good night's sleep that picture imprinted on my heart and you're not going to get the real remains it's not like they go on the plane go hey look at that strawberry blonde lock a hero i bet that's belongs to agnes from citizen over there did you find her uh shin bone earlier there put that over there what the  are you crazy they just go on the plane they go holy  look at that stuff and then they go here's the id says norm magdale 190 pounds okay shovel 190 pounds of stuff into a bag let's go daylight's burning stamp norm on the side of that one and send it off to his mother and then my mother gets and goes oh excellent good good wow now i can look back and laugh at us hey i didn't remember norm having three eyeballs i guess none of us really knew about mascara each not my heel what do you call uh what do you call uh those uh those laces that tie your shoes so uh i'm going to uh thank you oh my god i gotta start training again  man i don't even wanna think about what my abs look like now um  here's the problem with abs because i got six of them and uh the problem is i gotta wear a  shirt all the time so i'll be hanging around go hey guys what if i took my shirt off no i don't know why  it's like when you have a guy has a big  right now i don't have a big  but if a guy has a big  huh how the  is the girl supposed to know you know like i know they say if look at the guy's feet you know and i don't know if that's true or not i do know with with ladies however this is a thing for you man a little tip if you go into a bar you're looking at women right check out their feet because if they have big feet they're going to have big tits  anyways but here's the thing about flying and this is why this is why i believe in god because sometimes you survive an airplane crash but only very seldom only when you crash into the andes  because god likes  jokes end up so he's like  man instead of killing them all why don't i kill them but first made them wrestle with a moral quandary for ten or weeks cannibalism the quandary of cannibalism which i'm against i uh i guess most of you know that if you follow my career all my anti-cannibalism work and i'm not going to use this as some sort of bully pulpit to preach to you you know what i mean first of all you're adults and your views on cannibalism are not things that i'm going to change i i go to the youth the young kids you know tell them i travel all across this great continent you know except for mexico i don't want to mention it but canada and all through this great continent except for mexico by the way how did that even happen like i'm not a geography expert but you got canada it's cool right and then america it's cool and then mexico i don't know just dots gashes i guess they call it nowadays  everyone is going to say oh yes cannibalism so i travel from high school to high school and i tell the kids listen it's not cool to be a cannibal you know i'm not gonna lie to you you know you will be the talk of the school for a while you know but in the future i'm talking about you know because they look back on your  uh twitter and  and then they go oh what's this one i ate a guy  the problem with the andes and this moral quandary of cannibalism is that they don't start thinking about the moral quantity of cannibalism until they're in the 90s and then their minds are mixed up because it's so cold i am i i am prepared for any eventually because i like to pride myself on that any eventuality like any i might any time i'm on an airplane as soon as there's a little turbulence i go i'm eating that  in 14 seats  as soon as we crash into the end he's like pulling behind a i'd be like brad what's that again that's the problem anybody want to do crunches i feel like i need to do a few crunches  okay we've taken it to a vote and we're gonna eat the corpses okay where are the corpses i'm like ah oh horses yeah  i know where there's a whole bunch of bones a lot of meat on those bones  i can't do anything to me because  they haven't eaten in 80 days i'll eat those   i write down i wrote all this  down right because i think of jokes and then i go out write them down and i'll do them tonight or you know next week whatever and then here's the problem like i'm looking at a joke right now not a joke it says big fluffy dog and i remember when i wrote that down i didn't write down that piece of paper i wrote down on the notes section of my magic phone and what happened was i went to the dog park you know because i was taking my friend's dog over and uh my friend's dog and this big fluffy dog showed up and then they did this thing that was so funny and completely universal and uh i don't remember that's why i wrote down big fluffy dog but i shouldn't have written that so remember when i started comedy right we'd all get together the comedians we'd do a show and afterwards we'd go a  good  drink and do every goddamn drug that existed and then we'd all talk about comedy you know hey what about this joke i can go to the luggage and i got carousels look at that funny thing i never heard my life damn that's fine and we keep saying a funny thing but then the next day we'd wake up and of course the next day you don't wake up anything because you're a blackout drunk so you don't remember anything from the night before so i i thought i had an idea in my head and this was before you know magic phones or even teensy tape recorders i got me one of them little books you know little notebooks and i said next time at the party right if i say anything funny or if anybody says anything funny i'll just steal it a  i will write it down in my little uh my little book and the next day i'll have it so when i go to the smoky night club i'll have my grandchild so the next time the same thing we had a big  party and i said ah so funny everything so the next day i couldn't remember anything i was so excited i'll never forget as i ran to my little book and i opened it and all it said on it was that's so funny  don't be a son of a  i am when i started that i drank a lot when i started out and i don't do that anymore big part of the problem is that uh on the road when you drink see when you do stand up on the road you gotta go and do morning radio which is like  super early in the morning like seven eight o'clock you gotta do a couple hours of morning radio so if you party all night and i was always doing this man like i get  drunk and stoned everything and i get back to my hotel and i i remembered about the radio you know so i go yes excuse me can i get a wake-up call please for six o'clock  oh it's five to six okay well i better let you go you'll be dialing soon i guess  i remember when i dried they had this this is what stopped me from drinking was these little  drinks that were called shooters and uh the little tiny tastes like candy a  i'll drink 100 of them you know and then like try to find your wallet which is like right on the ground that's like a thousand miles away and uh and then i get home and driving the cab on the way home just put my head out like a dodge breath and try to not throw up and die ah memories  i remember the shooters always had sex names you know be like  that's a very popular one clearly it was just an excuse to sexually harass waitresses that's not a kid or something yo yeah what do i want i'll tell you what i want phyllis i would like you to give me a   oh and also my buddy phil i'd like you to give him two   or they would do the opposite they'd do like some real romantic thing because um you know you're conscious you have a conscious brain and a subconscious brain subconscious that makes those who are conscious and conscious oh so i don't know if you guys know this but um excited about a college name but your regular brain is up in the front i think and that you know tells you when you should stop eating count chocula because you're gonna throw up but then you have this subconscious and that  thing thinks all kinds of crazy  you don't even know what it's thinking and uh so anyways that's why they would do those romance my theory that's why they do those romantic drink things there was one the most popular one was called sex on the beach and i think it was because you're unconscious brave which is all drunk and we go hey maybe if i drink it that will happen to me but of course no it doesn't i don't know if you've ever had a night of drinking end up with making love on a beach very seldom that happens the only time i've ever heard it happened as a matter of fact was a young man named joran vander sallow oh my idea of a gentleman i'll tell you that but uh anyways uh so you probably will not end up making sweet sweet love on a beach but um and i'm not saying they should name them you know after what really happens after you get drunk then you would never order it you know nobody would go to a shooter bar go yeah give me a uh having sex with a dude i swear to god that was a lady i swear to god and my friends so i will have once again uh uh sex with a dude i swear to god i was a lady i did i think was it lady and my friend will have a uh senseless knife fight and don't scrimp on the gin this time the last one was a little sensible i do not drink anymore and i know you guys yes i know you think i'm better than you but i'm not better than you yeah i guess i am in a way but but not not just because i don't drink drugs and actually you know what you want to hear the truth i do do drugs and i'm going to tell you what i drink red bull right and you guys go hey red bull is not a drug really because it's got caffeine in it that's a drug you're like caffeine is not a drug oh yeah it is it's a drug and i smoke smoke cigarettes you know what that's not a drug really really it's got nicotine in it that's a drug you're like no that's not a dragon i'm like are you just   yes it's a drug nicotine is a drug caffeine is a drug whatever i do uh uh lsd very well that's not a drug really because it bends time  i don't do lz that often i just do it to before the show it's a little ritual i'll i'll eat a fistful of lsd and um they sent me this psychiatrist and a broken record this guy has he's like norm you have to stop eating a fistful of lsd before every show i'm like god damn it man is that all you ever say i love how he's the expert this guy this guy you said sam he's a  12 foot purple hound dog but he knows everything he knows it because he's read all those melting books behind them unbelievable where these guys get their  ideas there was a uh what was the uh think about that unconscious subconscious thing because i remember my buddy one time he's in psychology he took he went to college this guy and i love milk right so right we're eating a meal one time so i take a drink of milk and my friend goes you know why you're drinking that milk right norm and i say to him uh it's not because i like milk i know that  because i know this guy so he goes no it's not he goes the reason you're drinking that milk is because you you miss sucking on your mother's breast now you guys don't know my mother but she's wonderful she's a saint you know how people you know say their mothers are saying my mother is actually the same so i mean she hasn't performed two miracles or anything she's not actually the same but she's much more sane like than your  mother but there was a generation my mother is 85 there's a generation of women that you all know maybe as your mother maybe it was your grandmother but they lived in a time and i support you me too youtube more than that because you know for the young girls it's gonna be fantastic but no one like my mother will ever exist again and it's just this generation of women that were so like selfless and like my mother would be you know the type of woman like at dinner time she's in the everyone's eating and she's in the kitchen and everybody having a second you know did you are you sure and then oh my the turn ups the turnips and uh wanted to make sure everybody got and then she would whatever was left she would make a little plate for herself you know and uh that's why i was like there still is like she lives right beside me her eyes shine love i've never heard her say a phrase that had any irony flecked in you know she's just been so happy you know like she'll come back to the grocery store she would normally play stay happy with the story say what happened she says there was a woman buying a pineapple it was a dollar 69 last week and this week it was a dollar nineteen not a story old bag what the  story i said i don't say that but but i would trade plays with mothers in a second because she all she knows is love you know how to love people that's hard man that's hard um oh i remember i don't want to suck her tits  to me i'm shallow oh a second last chest all right anyways i'm having this discussion with this guy at the  restaurant and now after he tells me this the milk is still there and what the  am i going to do i can't even leave it there the worst oh and then it came time to order our entrees you know what this guy gets two meatballs and a banana i'm like hey  it wasn't around the menu what's good for the gooses this is absolutely  i read about that subconscious unconsciously said when you pick a president this is an election year this is kind of a word acropro you ever say a word you i hope this is what it means um that when you vote for a president they say the real reason you the uh and that does uh explain the results of the last election i think because who the  would want to have a beer with hillary clinton  making a picture early  meanwhile trump god damn it'll be the funnest  beer ever god damn these big golden chairs by the    by the way when he said that he didn't say that he said if you were a celebrity you grabbed by the  now i used to be on the tv i don't think i  got enough out of my celebrity i swear to god you know i was on saturday night my kid wanted to go to college i didn't know i could put him in harvard which by the way is  super expensive also well i just didn't know and with the women i would first of all i wouldn't even know how to grab one by the  because a woman's if you know anything about a woman's physio to me it's like inverted it's not like a you know i mean like i could grab a what they grab a guy's juicy  and hot beautiful balls and be simple i don't care if you have been on the tv but my thing with women was i would say to the woman hey any interest to let me lie down on top of you and they would say no and they'd say how about we have a dinner because i like eating dinner with a i got my tv tray you know i got my tv dinner and i got my tv and i got my matlock i don't have dvds i have cds but not cds  but anyways i would go to dinner with the lady and then you know maybe we'd have another dinner and then afterwards i go hey eddie you have any thinking of that uh me lying down everything and she goes yeah i don't want to do it she goes maybe you have another dinner who knows so then like 40 50 dinners later she decides that she'll let me lie down on top so and also i feel i should have gotten way more women than eight because i was on the tv um i here's the biggest thing about me as a guy no surprises you know what i mean like i feel ladies must have a lot of surprises you know where at the last second suddenly  on their foot or something nothing like that with me man i'm  i have so much respect for ladies i take the lady this is this is my uh my land out ladies by the way i don't do it anymore because i'm too old but i have a pickup line that i'm willing to give you guys if you want it um i will tell you that it's never worked ever once but it should work and i really don't understand why it doesn't because on paper it's the perfect pickup line i will look at a girl maybe a girl be sitting over at the bar there right and uh she's drinking alcohol i can tell because there's a you know a  umbrella and uh so i sidle up the cider and i whisper discretion being the part of valor into her ear so no one else can hear i just whisper i can get us a bottle  never worked one single time you figure one out of a thousand that's what my buddy told me he said you know what you do as well as a young kid he goes you just go up to a girl and go hey you want to  and 99 of them  punch you in the face but one of them  you turns out a hundred of them punch you in the face and none of them  you  but we're all worth it for those eight ladies so i'll take the lady this is how much respect i show ladies i take them into my bedroom which is completely dark black can't see your own hand and uh then we go to uh separate corners in this row are you going to the bed is in the middle of the room on the bed seven or eight quilts you know we get underneath don't speak you find each other you know five or ten minutes pass and we never speak of it again but still didn't get much return business i don't know nowadays though i don't know what the  you know what i mean porno and jesus christ that's what i can't understand about us because we're in a culture wherever it's outraged and offended by everything yeah but they go god damn you're that stand-up comedian god damn he was offended so offensive am i well he didn't offend me i i've seen internet pornography you think anything a  guy would say on stage would offend me i've seen hell it's out i mean i don't know if you've ever seen internet pornography but by god if you haven't don't because it changes you i mean fundamentally changes not for the better i remember when i first sat when you first see internet pornography you're shocked by the sheer volume you know it's always one to 12 of 35 billion you know  and anyway and you never see the same lady twice so is every lady a  when did this happen and they're all doing stuff that no lady's ever ever done to me and i was on the tv  after a while it desensitizes you you know that word that you're reading those big thick books you get desensitized and then first you know you're whacking off eight times a day but after a while you eat more and more like any addiction you know what i mean you're like no i can't find anything this one she only take eight  up her ass what the  wrong with her i mean she's a prude why did you get in the business in the first place i'll find the worst thing a person can do to another person  very misogynistic too you tell by the way they name those little five-minute things yeah so i was like a dirty  horror love sucking  and guzzling come down here  it's not the motion picture i just watched got off the bus i can't do that  but then it's hard to go back you know to lying down and have a lady if you've seen that or outrage i'm outraged outraged nowadays god damn i walk down new york city lower manhattan ankle deep and blood and bones  papers cascading around my head with words on them like urgent and bulletin for your eyes only and they covered the sky like profane ticket tape parade and uh me searching for my older brother he was in northern ontario know how scary it is when a building chases you down the  street  i can honestly say a building chased me down the street crazy but i'm outraged by shane gillis or some  thing not outraged by anything not  devastated man i wish you know i wish i had as big a heart as everybody else because i hear people they go god it's devastating i saw that hurricane i'm like really huh i give a  the most boring story i ever heard i mean it makes me sad that nothing makes me feel sad but so big you know that's a pretty good one makes me sad that makes me feel sad and then i can put that on the side of a cup think about how much wisdom there is today compared in the old days you have to read a whole goddamn  book that thick by  a guy you never heard of uh and then maybe there'd be one wise thing now just go to a cup store every cup has the wisest  you've ever heard oh god damn i'm gonna buy that cup  it i'll remember that one i haven't gone to a cup store for oh my god almighty i apologize i forgot to start my act we only have four more minutes

things that the metoo things and then sometimes then something's there like uh you know the big one believe all women yeah that's it's a good one god knows we've never heard a woman lie that's the craziest notion of all time if you want to find out if women lie all the time here's who you ask a woman she'll die you're in your window with a woman and she's like   henrietta's coming over god damn hi henrietta hey and i think women are i think women are more are actually better than men you know not smarter but i always say not smart because i hear so many times on stage chicago i think women are smarter than men that everybody claps they go what the  a terrible thing to say women are smarter than people clap and then i thought about it and i said why would they clap and  and i realize the only reason they're clapping is because they don't believe it's true at all they believe the opposite so it's actually an ugly thing of course women and men emphasis him and we're all  idiots any of us are smart that feller what uh speaks funny and drives around in his uh electric uh race wheelchair did he did he  smartest guy on earth only thing he was interested in was    hurry up and figure

think yes i'm now i've cut   it i'm about the keys okay flying the key is fine okay reverse fine okay then you're going down the 
freeway you think you're traveling at light speed   you think scotty's sitting next you're going 
jim you can't push it any faster especially   don't blame it over the edge your hair is blowing 
in the wind and the window isn't even open   you're that stoned you turn on the radio   you understand everything yeah suddenly on the 
radio man stone on freeway how do they know how do   they know god damn it i'm okay i'm fine i'm fine 
suddenly in the rearview mirror red white and blue   red white and blue how patriotic yeah please eat 
everything in the ashtray eat everything and ask   oh god i'll pull it over pull it over 
all of a sudden you start rehearsing   what seems to be the problem officer 
what seems to be the problem officer   he's fine i'm trying what seems to be the problem 
nice day officer what seems to be the problem   usually you're stopped by a motorcycle 
cops he gets off his bike like   god am i incredibly well endowed 
i'll get your door there you go from inside your car comes 
his colombian sauna like   suddenly he's going i'm hungry i don't know 
why you're looking at him you've rehearsed   your line but you see the problem i'll see 
you through the problem you look at him and go and as you look at him his face turns into a 
cheeseburger you lunge next thing you know you end   up in a cell please don't hurt me but the truth is 
you wake up and you're still on the couch at home   you've never left you're still there and you 
were there and you were there and who are you   and there's total going you're stoned man you're 
just stoned see there's people know who are even   beyond marijuana you know the people who are 
going like hey is the show on you know what   i'm talking about the peruvian marching powder 
the devil's dandruff nice thing though cocaine   what a wonderful drug anything that makes you 
paranoid and impotent give me more of that what a fake thing to do 
we're back with sound again i got the sound from hollywood people in the balcony were going we understood 
him i guess juilliard helped for a brief moment   i could enunciate to the back row just 
like sylvester stallone doing hamlet   this would be a place for stallone 
could do hamlet to be or what we're back again we were discussing 
cocaine for a brief moment   the sound crapped up but that's 
why i'm using supposed sound no one wants their tapes back i wonder why   we're talking about how cocaine basically affects 
you there's also something called freebasing   it's not free it costs your house 
it should be called home basing here's a little warning sign if you have a cocaine 
problem first of all if you come home to your   house you have no furniture and your cat's going 
i'm out of here prick warning number two if you   have this dream where you're doing cocaine in your 
sleep and you can't fall asleep and you're doing   cocaine in your sleep and you can't fall asleep 
and you wake up and you're doing cocaine bingo   number three if on your tax form it says 
fifty thousand dollars for snacks mayday you got yourself a cocaine problem smart ass and 
everybody's doing cocaine baseball players have   to go in front of a grand jury they're saying 
yeah i did cocaine can you blame me it's a slow   goddamn game come on jack i'm standing out 
left here for seven innings there's a white   line going all the way down to home plate 
the hell i see the guy putting it out going and that damn organ music the third base coat's doing they said all the time   when he does this i don't know whether to 
slide or do a line you know what i'm saying   and people are sliding in the home plate head 
first yeah you out doesn't matter baby i'm up now ah yeah and don't tell me don't tell me 
those old-time baseball players weren't   doing cocaine you ever see those 
old films of babe ruth i'm gonna tell me that he was feeding his titties 
all goddamn now football players you can   understand doing a little medication once in a 
while because in football you're playing a game   against people who are six foot eight weigh 250 
pounds coming at you at 80 miles an hour of course   you're gonna go yeah give it to me naturally 
no no bubba do you do steroids no sir i do not no baby no no you're playing a game 
against a man called the refrigerator   he is not a refrigerator he's a goddamn 
house with legs if you're a quarterback   you pull back and go sit down godzilla 
one two four bags  it's an eclipse   no it's not tiny white man it's just me tell 
me about the rabbits tell me about the rabbit remember that time remember the time that 
sizeman got tackled so hard his leg came up   way back that way and just so it really hurt 
again they showed it to you in slow motion   and every man at home is 
going don't show that again   that's bad news baby there are even indian 
yogis sitting at home going do not try this   at home a scary thought now there must be some 
sports where they don't do cocaine i mean you   can't think of golfers coked out of their ass in 
the first tee going four five get it out of here   little golf cart too slow i'm running i'm running 
and you couldn't be paranoid in the sand trap corn   i'm never getting out of here alive man i'm 
never getting out of here alive the commentator   he seems to be having problems on the third tee 
why are you talking so low man why are these 300   people walking behind me so slow look in the 
hole there might be a snake look in the hole golf is one of the few sports where a white man   can dress like a black pen but not 
look bad you know what i'm saying i want to tell you one thing you don't really 
need cocaine to get really high you know what   i'm saying because there's another way to get 
really high it's real cheap just run 26 miles   you ever see a marathon runner you ever see 
the look on his face it's the same look like how you doing i'm alive yeah and it only costs you a pair 
of  shoes you don't understand   it's the same thing you know why he's so high 
because his body is pumped full of endorphins   it's the brain going if you keep this 
pain  up i'm gonna hurt you   because that's why when you run the first 
couple of miles you're going i'm fabulous   after about eight miles 
you're going i'm not too good   after about 26 miles you're going why the [ 
__ ] did i do this and you have that look like and you never see a guy hanging 
out by a track home my man you need a pair of nikes try one shoe on do this for a 
while because you don't need it   the basic thing to remember about cocaine 
is this there was once a documentary they   asked approving indian chief they said 
chief what's cocaine you look right in   the camera and said cocaine it's our little 
gift to the white man for what you did to us   yeah you take our land we'll give you 
a monkey for your back that's in fear yeah don't you know that don't you see it now 
it's probably of course i know a lot of people   are going you know helen and i basically we did 
drugs in the 70s when the 80s what we like to do   is get all of our stuff together 
and go that gets me high that's it   we like to look at the sharper image cat glow and 
go we don't have that yet we don't have that yet   and that whole thing in africa pisses me off 
everyone's sending food to africa let's send   some cocktails let's make it a party goddamn 
there's your father over there with 15 cups of   coffee eight cigarettes going your mother and 
i never did drugs come on your mom's taking   three valium she's passed out in front 
of the tv going don't change the channel   don't you see don't you see oh look at this 
maybe if japanese people did cocaine to be like you have to be very careful because 
they can nail your ass at any time   in california you can get nailed for not having 
your seat belt on if you're on the freeway there   you are you see a cop around my seat belt next 
thing you know you're on the hood of your car   going you realize you didn't have your seatbelt 
on no  yeah california we got different type   of police you get stopped in west hollywood 
stop those shoes don't go with those pants but you're used to police here a little bit 
easier basically your new york cops couple   hundred pounds overweight wandering around like 
hey you know what i'm saying he's over there   going  miami vice where's my maserati 
nowhere okay somebody comes up with a knife   i'll kill you okay give it your best shot hey 
okay get out of here give me the knife go on but of course the best police in all the 
world you know what i'm talking about   below that little manson nixon line yeah 
just down below there when you're going   down south you get stopped in your bmw 
they're smart ass you're in for good game   there's a good old boys the one wearing the 
mirrored sunglasses with a mirror on the inside yeah you ready now they usually have 
one assistant who sits in the car going we got him bubba don't wait we got him now 
squeal get ready for it squeeze come on yeah and you're scared boy you're 
scared you think you're ending up   with a cell with a man named bubba 
going you're my little puppy now this is strange to think that if you commit 
sodomy and georgia they're going to put you in   a cell with another man who's going to sodomize 
you brother the whole country's intense you   want to know why the police are intense because 
we're intense we're armed and they're armed yay   it's in the constitution says you have the 
right to bear arms or the right to armed   bears whatever the hell you want to do national 
rifle association says you have the right to have   armor piercing bullets if you're a hunter why 
how many deer wear a bulletproof vest is there   one big gear out there going i'm ready for your 
ass come on give it your best shot let's party   i've got a human call i got a course i got a cord 
it's scary to think that most hunters are people   who drink a lot of alcohol with a heavy caliber 
weapon out there going yeah it looks like a deer oh  sorry bob ah strap him on the truck 
anyway cut a couple of limbs off put them on   they won't know god we're all armed here in new 
york at least you don't get a lot of handguns in   california everybody's got handguns even ladies 
we're just carrying 22s just makes a small hulk i got tired of carrying my mace because he used to   mix it up with my breath first 
and go oh there goes the day this is the point in california 
we're going to come home and go   honey i'm home easy dear hold 
it honey dad i got you holy boy it's family feud the home game it's the 
mansions versus the hinckley's come on down   show me automatic weapons survey says 50 dead 
now in england if you commit a crime the police   don't have a gun and you don't have a gun so if 
you commit a climate stop or i'll say stop again but here everybody knows we are armed 
and it's escalating it's gonna get to   the point we're gonna come home one day 
and people across the street are gone   i built this cruise missile to 
stop these kids from playing zz top   and the next thing you know it goes beyond 
that it's road warrior on the freeway   people start mounting twin 50 caliber machine 
guns on the front of their chevrolet going   look helen a slow chinese driver no you think 
you've got him but he's in front of me going nah   i've got a flamethrower in the trunk your 
wonton and one little lady up on the front   of them with a little tiny volkswagen 
with a grenade launcher going make my day   it's all there we're americans we're simple 
people but if you piss us off we'll bomb your   cities think about that just ask the japanese to 
go what we bomb one hopper next thing you know   you nuka town but the nice thing is you build 
this back up you buy our products nice people   the whole thing and at the top of the heap 
there's ronald reagan with a look in his   eyes like they're going to put swinging 
doors in the congress so it's going to be i'm back and i'm pissed off got that 
look in his eyes here's a president   that said what would this country 
be without this great land of ours wait a minute excuse me sir mr reagan under 
redundant in the dictionary it says see redundant fine you got me on that one don't you see that 
look in his eyes he's not dealing with the real   world anymore here's a man in a presidential 
debate referred to army uniforms as costumes so in other words war is the big film so if he 
launches a nuclear weapon that's a wrap everybody   no no no no no don't you see when he's talking to 
congress he's got that look in his eyes like it's   not congress anymore it's the old actor's home 
there's tip o'neill he's talking about central   america but all of a sudden tip's face starts

somewhere in the background going they don't   understand you like i do you have to 
understand me look here mr reagan look   cambodian  rugged cambodian  i'll 
be here if you need me i'll be in the bag suddenly suddenly teddy kennedy stands 
up but it's not teddy can't anymore iran   it's jimmy stewart or mr president you

like listen man you got a choice   okay i can either hump your leg 
or leave the house it's up to you   that's right at the time when your cat looks 
at you like you've ever seen this before basically it's not urge it's springtime it's 
nature crying out let's party it's time to go   wild and do that dance of love it's time 
when male birds do that incredible thing   where they go check it out check it out 
check it out i'm incredible check it out   and the female birds are usually going maybe 
yes and we as human beings we are driven by   the same sexual desire men you know you have a 
tiny creature living between your legs that has   no memory and no conscience you know that you know 
you have no control there is no control over this   tiny beast you wake up in the morning he's been up 
five minutes before you're like how are you doing no contest comes over he's there morning time for jumping yeah and whoever you will 
they look at you like who are you thinking about   ah he looks some of that one good iron nobody 
i'm on my own let's play horseshoes get a towel   put a hat on me let's take a tag and you may be 
playing force maybe with other men you've just   done manly things you've played a good game of 
football you've just turned your friend's face   into goo you're in the locker room you're soaping 
up going good game everybody all of a sudden he   rises up and goes hey good game everybody all 
your friends are going yeah real good game bob you have no control it should be a separate 
creature should be able to take it off boom   put him on the ground take him for a 
walk he's got the rollers to be like you'd have some control at least some control here you'd have some control then but as it is now 
you have none no control at all women know this   when you look at it you can see the look in their 
eyes like oh it's a ridiculous piece of flesh   my god looks like a snail 
wearing a helmet what is it   oh if you're uncircumcised like a snake wearing 
a sweater you know that it's ridiculous but the   moment he starts to rise yeah it's a different 
case to get that look in their eyes like alien strange why why is he here why are we 
driven by this desire we have lust lust   permeates our soul sometimes men we are so 
driven by this lust that we have a violent   streak that comes along with it if we can't [ 
__ ] it we'll kill it you know what i'm saying   it's like that that's how we make weapons a 
nuclear bomb it's basically a man's way of   saying i'm gonna  up the earth yeah 
a woman would never make a nuclear weapon   they would never make a bomb that kills you they'd 
make a bomb that makes you feel bad for a while   i think that'd be a whole other thing 
that's why there should be a woman   president don't you see it'd be a wonderful thing be an incredible concept back 
there would never be any wars   just every 28 days some intense negotiations because you have that release as a 
woman every 28 days you can get crazy   your friend comes into town i 
don't think it's a friend do you   how many friends make you want to stand on 
top of the roof with automatic weapon get now   get in the  house no it's not a 
friend that's why men are going no maybe not we're driven we are driven by this 
desire by this strange creature   wouldn't it be nice sometimes would 
it be nice if you can go into a bar   buy him a drink once in a while there'd be a big 
bar up here a little bar down here for him go   under the bar here put him out he's looking up at 
you with that one good eye like how you been baby   sorry about last night i guess i got nervous 
fired up a couple of warning shots what the hell   but if you didn't try and strangle me i'd 
have a better chance you know what i'm saying   the hell i can't go back in there man that's 
some scary stuff you know what i'm saying   i'm not going back without a wetsuit 
in the mining helmet i tell you that   you better work on that stuff i'm 
not going back hell no i won't go   hey forget what i said who's that i'm 
going down here you talk to her down scope don't you see it'll be the only true character 
witness you could ever have at a divorce trial   your honor i'd like to bring out 
a character witness right now i believe it has a lot of bearing on the case 
promise to tell the whole truth nothing about   truth bombs raise your right hand i don't 
have a right hand but i'll give it a shot mr phallus on the night of the 
15th what do you remember well   it was light it was dark it was 
light it was dark it was light couldn't see very well what the hell i told you 
god damn what the hell am i supposed to do what   do you want from me god damn it i had no he's the 
commander i merely sat down here i was i held the   testicles i didn't know why i i am not an animal 
i am a sexual organ it is this creature this lust   but what compensates for this there's also your 
heart your heart is romance going what about love   what about poetry and he's down 
they're gone whatever works babe yeah   then above romance takes your mind 
going i i believe you're both right   we must propagate the species but yet we 
still must have conversation afterwards   that's why i'm looking for a woman 
who gives mind if you catch my dread   that's why we are driven to meet 
miss right or at least miss right now and you do and you do the act the wonderful 
act of making love and you're making love   and you feel like a god and the moment you 
have an orgasm you look like goddamn goofy you're going yes yes yes whoa is this fun or what oh whoa wow and if we 
found somebody else it'd be even more fun   oh god men can't fake an orgasm who wants to 
look that dumb you know what i'm saying it's an   incredible thing because once a man has an orgasm 
he's there as a vulnerable human being and then at that point women usually go i'm ready he's there like a little prize fighter going uh 
oh charlie i could have been somebody goddamn   i melted incredible things you try you try that's when 
you need sexual therapy   that's when you need help from a little 
tiny lady like dr ruth westheimer   yes dr westheimer here's a woman talking about 
oral sex and you know she doesn't even eat pork   warning the wonderful way she talks about it she 
talks about the penis like it's a cooking show   first of all take the man's penis 
between your fingers knead the bread   baby don't be doing that with my tiny johnson 
uh-huh uh baby i'm saying if you want sexual   health you don't want a little tiny jewish 
lady you want a large black lady named dr roof   yeah she'll help your ass stand cause she'll 
be goddamn honest with you you call and say   a doctor roof i have a small penis does that 
make a difference she'll go damn straight baby honey you can't make butter with a 
toothpick you know what i'm saying work with it baby don't be coming at me with that 
little thing dress it up get some puppet show   stuff make it sing make a dance it's going to blow 
get that thing away from me uh man man you better   learn some foreplay you know what i'm saying 
most men the four players are hey here i come ah   most men women you know what it's like they 
grab your titties like they're making bread   you know like they're trying to 
push them together make one good one he's a flesh baby that's you don't let them grab 
that stuff you say you wanna make cookies get   in there you wanna  stay here don't 
be doing this stuff now uh-uh and they do   this thing where they grab your nipples real 
hard and go ooh does that get you hot oh yeah   oh i'm on fire now chief smoke 
yeah mr vice grip mr flyers   i'm gonna do this thing when they start 
grabbing your nipples and turning like   a dial on a  radio hell is that what 
are you dialing radio free europe get your next time a man grabs you like this you 
grab his little testicles that a slinky   i think you're wise up yes sir   he'll learn some goddamn sensitivity then 
and if you squeeze his eyes and go wow   you'll have his attention he's not gonna fall 
asleep on your ass stand he starts to naught   off boom i'm back baby i'm back cause that's the 
way it is baby and men don't be afraid of oral sex   i know most men are going hurt i'm out of there 
uh-uh i say bring a lunch stay for the day baby   and if you can't look at it bring a mr potato 
head make it look like somebody you know yeah make it look like sigmund 
freud your uncle murray anybody   have a good time enjoy yourself have a good time 
never this serious stuff i men get all so serious   like behold get that thing out of here have a good 
time and use some birth control girls because you   better be using something because those sperm 
are coming out of that at 500 miles an hour   a little piece of rubber is not going to stop 
that it's like putting gauze in front of a semi   going come on through uh-uh my diaphragm is at 
least good because it's a little tiny trampoline   for the sperm you know what i'm saying doesn't 
stop them but it amuses their ass for a while   no you didn't find a captain 
rigby sperm doing this stuff yeah   that stuff keeps them going makes them wonder 
where they are and man if they're not going to   use a diaphragm use a prophylactic you know what 
i'm saying use a prophylactic and i know most men   go i am not going to wear a prophylactic because 
make my penis look like a tiny terrorist uh-uh   no baby put it on even the one the little 
reservoir tip makes it look like a krishna   i know i like it put it on baby wear it and 
don't get the ones with ribs if you want   ribs go get barbecue don't do that don't get the 
tickler the french tickler one on you that looks   like a damn seeing enemy we're not doing jack 
who's still here get that damn thing off just   use some simple birth control cause ladies the 
best birth control in the whole world is simply there can't take it you can't take that men cannot 
take laughter at the mighty sword you know that   that's why it's down here with the whole damn 
purpose the whole thing the whole reason you're   doing all this is because one little sperm gets 
through bam you got yourself something wonderful   and you're lucky you get any good sperm 
at all because when you're making love   your testicles like a little punching 
bag it's like your semen don't come   out there like leon stinks going 
i could have fought better howard i could have come at him but he seemed 
to move away from me that's it one little   sperm gets in there makes contact boom it's like a 
chromosome square dance 24 chromosomes coming down comes from spinning around dominant g means hair 
is brown about your father about your mother   and you've just created a tiny creature 
that'll eventually quit college on you too you're off and running the wonders of life and 
women know the moment they get pregnant because   there's like a ping and they start to glow 
and you expect to see three wise men show up   at your door and go we saw a star dude they've 
got this incredible feeling about them and the   natural process takes a slow slow transition and 
three months later the wonderful thing happens   the titty fairy arrives and in one night she goes 
from zero to aida yeah thank you jesus thank you even he's going who the hell is that merry 
christmas thank you ramming speed boom boom   no you make one move to them 
it's like no they're for the baby come on he's only got one 
mouth let's warm him up come on and along with the titty fairy something 
else happens a couple months later six months   something amazing happens the hormone fairy 
arrives and her moods start to change  it   makes her period look like nothing come home 
she'll be waiting for the door with a large knife daddy honey and the only thing 
that'll save your ass is haagen-dazs thank you if you leave it there at the door 
she'll come out five feet and go it's over and you'll prepare you prepare 
for that moment which you think is every   day from six months to nine months every day 
you'll be going are you okay should be going   i'm fine are you okay i'm fine and you'll 
know on that ninth day of the ninth month   it'll be time because you'll come home and she'll 
have the entire house packed in two small bags and she'll have it look in her eyes like and if you don't move she'll grab your 
scrotum and pull it up over your head i think you have to go now let's go because your little wife has 
suddenly transformed into ralph   get it gramdan nothing get it out because 
she is passing her creature 50 times larger   than the orifice that's supposed to 
come out it's whoopee dime get glue   and you're driving down the freeway yes she's like 
de niro and main street screaming out the window you think i've got to get her to the 
hospital but i've also got to get the   screaming  out of the car dear god help me 
should be very calm i'm fine no i'm not moving   you get to the hospital you think okay let's 
go let's go now they're going to happen you're   carrying the bags there's usually one attendant 
going you must fill out some forms  you   sabu get out of the way come on let's go she's 
on a gurney she looks like a great white whale   have you seen the great white mother 
that way you're rolling down the aisle   attendants are going back home you better do it 
real quick now yeah you screaming to get her in   there to the operating room which is a very subtle 
sweet place  it's earl shives living room   bright bright lights she's screaming 
like crazy you're going like this   let's breathe honey let's breathe because you have 
this myth that you're sharing the birth experience  unless you're passing a 
bowling ball i don't think so unless you're circumcising yourself with a 
chainsaw i don't think so unless you're opening   an umbrella up your ass i don't think so you're 
not doing diddly squat you're alone for the ride   and you're there breathing you're 
hyperventilating she's looking like   what the  are you doing why 
don't you knock me out to    and usually there's an anesthesiologist 
in the corner guns you need anything man leave him she wheels her ass over there 
give me that little dumb stone prick oh get it out and after 10 15 hours of sheer bliss   you're rewarded with a baby but  it's not a 
baby it's a little old man dipped in 40 ways it's   like gandhi and churchill had a child you know 
what i'm saying a little tiny thing there it's a   little tiny creature like yeah i'm looking for the 
breast i'm looking for the breath it's a strange   creature and now that you have a child you have 
to clean up your act cause you can't drink anymore   you can't come home drunk and go hey here's 
a little switch daddy's gonna throw up on you you can't get stoned because they have 
toys that'll mess your head up if you're   stoned with a transformer it's a truck 
it's a robot it's what the  is it and you couldn't do cocaine you couldn't 
do cooking there's a teddy ruxpin doll   i i'm teddy ruxdan it's the type 
of doll you think that when you   fall asleep the dog wakes up and 
goes you must kill mommy and daddy you don't need drugs when you have a 
kid you're awake you're paranoid you   smell bad it's the same thing you're like 
the baby i've come home sometimes saw my   wife in the doorway with a large knife 
going i think you should talk to him   you expect to walk in the nursery see the kid 
five feet over the floor going come in father damien put the dog down damien   because they do horrible things little 
babies they go up to the dog and go doggy you can see the dog look at him like you'd be dead if you're a 
cat but since they love you god okay and then they do something wonderful 
though just when you're about to play hand   baby they look at you and go daddy oh 
then he looks at the dog and goes daddy   when the dog looks at you i don't 
have to send him to college yeah   there's nothing you can do my son is three 
years old it's an amazing time it's like big   head little tiny body it's an outrageous time 
when they ask you about everything it's like   why is the sky blue well because of 
the atmosphere why is our atmosphere   well because we need to breathe why do we 
breathe what the  do you want to know a year ago you were sitting in your 
own  now you're carl sagan   what is this who are you are you buddha asked

be afraid because you know when you look at the World Cup America we made it to the 16 man we're no longer in the Special Olympics can't go home it is to see us coming one or give it to them they're damaged people unlike the Brazilians men when the Brazilians place like Bank then don't bending didn't they and the fans are like an big event Amy Brazilians go look I'm playing soccer okay look I'm scoring and now I'm kicking the ball Melo you know it's a little passive-aggressive though when you got that thing of like kids I didn't do anything what are you looking at it's not like hockey where someone comes up with a stick and goes back mother bomb that's why they know Spanish hockey players cuz the first time a white guy takes a stick and goes yeah and you Freddy Krueger  take off the mask for the  are coming in there got a minute but like soccer sometimes guys do this weird thing they'll fall down to pretend like oh  I'm sorry I think I've been whining there's nobody near me huh okay

where were you six years ago where were you six years ago when the 49ers had a quarterback going well hike when the energy's right when they used to have linemen you go like well i really can't deal with him his pressure's too intense i mean he just he wants to run over me and i tried all the moves i tried the thing i let him go by and then i pushed him get off get off the field i don't need this pressure no what is it going to be there's a football strike on now i mean what are those guys going to do for a living i mean there's one picket line i don't want to cross how you doing mr green oh you better not mess with me oh thank you mr green thank you i mean what are those guys going to do what's the center going to do now that he's out of work working a fast food restaurant going your hamburger's ready what are the referees what are the referees going to do become like referee's going to come go go dyslexia is a horrible disease i was the only child in halloween to go hi trick or

let's go td let's go don't you know flipping now but now now the 49ers have real linemen you know what i'm talking about you know head neck optional big men big men they go like what do you do today billy bob well basically what i like to do is break through the line grab a quarterback and say make a wish strange oh what is a center what a position is a man who plays center what do you say what do you do for living you say what do you do well basically i bend over have a little towel hang over my ass must be very compromising when somebody walks up behind you and goes why haven't you called me at that point yo you're out of here clown but also the most important man of all a little tiny man named the field goal kicker usually european with names like ibano khalid and that usually like this is usually like okay field goal thousand dollars field goal two thousand dollars oh linemen  it take the ball but the real important man on the football team we know is the quarterback usually usually men with big hands and big feet and you ladies know what that means yes yes big gloves and big shoes these quarterbacks are always shot in slow motion because they're always coming up to the line it's always very much instant replay      man   elliott elliott  ouch i'm standing on my testicles  it's a very very tender area oh easy boy is he always it's like a little rodeo pony in there let me out come on grab it no no i can't grab him because he'll be going whoa men do that though we do grab a little area down here we don't know why it's when you're nervous you always see guys i get a little nervous like gosh sorry honey damn it it's a strange beast i don't know why even president reagan must be that's why i have a little podium cutting him off nancy and i have no no everyone knows every man in a nervous situation will be grabbing that's why they used to tell the baseball players don't touch that so i see a lot of guys going yeah yeah okay i don't know yes most men can't even call it what it is they say what is that a penis what it's my penis you can't say it can you no i can't so we think of other names they're really macho guys what do you call it that's the incredible heat-seeking moisture missile yes it may not have a conscience but it does have a memory watch out fire one easy boy whoa fire too well feels like it's leading you around down i don't care who is here and you get like sometimes the other guy's adventurous it's the throbbing python of love i'd like to kind of compromise in between i like to call him mr happy so if something's going wrong you say oh look he's pouting hi peek-a-boo so nice to know mr happy has luggage too like where do you want these bags strange little creature oh no you look down you look at him going why remember i can't wait till they have the metric system though single how big are you 120. you can call me mr tripod now i dumb say but why why do we evolve with mr happy here is it like in the old days so they can tell times what time is it about 12. no well maybe about three now whoa yeah i knew now hey why why why couldn't he be right here wouldn't it be nice if mr happy you're in the middle of your chest should make dancing a lot more fun you'll be dancing going having a nice night betty yes i am tom but what's that fountain pen well it's leaking it's a strange relationship that men have with mr happy it usually starts oops here comes my ride  what we're talking about doesn't matter i think it's kind of once again we went off that way the police set me off it's like that way i guess but most people look out once again i look out the faces people say it's all right my mother's over there saying just like the old days isn't it mama knows mama used to see me and she'd tell me these wonderful jokes see my first joke was i love you in blue i love you in red most of all i love you in blue see mama it's still work we come to america with a dream and look where we buy a house in tiberan oh yes tiburon from the spanish word tiberon meaning condominium condominium from the latin word meaning to overcharge for no reason we were talking about before my little friend right now he's like get back to me i know that shut up she's like oh come on come on but we men know the first time you met mr happy was during a time called puberty puberty is when nature says shake hands with mr happy i don't know do you know what's like you know you're upstairs usually with a copy of national geographic playing senior wences will you call me in the city not to me but no one has the real guts no one has the honesty when you're locked in the bathroom your father's knocking on the door you're in there oiling the old baseball glove and your father is knocking on the door going what are you doing in there son no one had the honesty to say going blind damn it i don't care the feels is good i'll take the hair i don't mind and then you have the other problems when you're going through puberty

therapy hey you guys are fair i like that is it hot in here is my molly kicking in by the way yeah it's wild all right here we go maybe i'm just getting coming down with something here all right i got the old delta ah by the way thank god it's not the spirit variant because uh the vaccine will be an additional fee but um airplane joke got it in all right all right jews are cool because you're one

up or whatever you know horribly oppressed you know gas chambers and whatnot but i guess because it wasn't here we're good all right i'm just trying to figure out the rule there's no rhyme or reason to like what you're allowed to you know all right i just want to learn i don't mean anything by any of this none of this don't i hope nobody takes anything seriously or else you're pretty  stupid but uh but yeah just fascinating that you can still  on the jews um not saying it's a good thing i just think it's objectively it's interesting all right it got feels like it got weirder all right just pointing it out i don't don't i didn't do anything just saying all right all right um all right jesus christ it's 900 degrees in this basement we got 300 something people in here is it on here or did

rough we'll figure that out or maybe it's nothing maybe it's nothing okay it's the hard part about comedy the only way to learn is to be completely humiliated in front of 325 people well i guess it's like eating  or something you know you got to just try weird  and if you hear a noise you go alright i'll do that again that's why some people laugh quietly or like a girl doesn't moan and after sex she's like that was great i'm like hi you gotta say something sister you know give me a response okay you guys got work in the morning oh  all right hey guys work from home i assume oh all right all

Mark Normand,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRW2_gQD25A," all right everybody welcome to the pace comedy showcase you guys ready to get this show started make some noise for your host MC performs all over the country big applaud for Kevin O'Shea hey everybody yeah that's you thank you guys for coming out yeah it's you give it up for yourselves come on it's you the best you you can be we've got a great show for you guys keep it going for pace magazine for helping us put this all together some great comments from you some from television all beautiful humans just here to entertain you tonight all right you guys ready to get in you guys right you have something  fun you've had beer you've had pizza you're ready for comedy yeah I love about me my name's Kevin O'Shea and on a scale of 1 to 10 I weigh 245 pounds thank you I obsess about weight I I know I do I ran into a friend of mine I hadn't seen him in six months and he lost 75 pounds it was a big deal like he used to look like I just like a stone fat Hobbit and now he just looks like this really athletic stoned Hobbit I was like Shawn what happened he's like a crazy story you're never gonna believe it I needed to get dental surgery but I didn't have any money so I went to dental school and they did it for free but like it's a school so the guy who didn't did it was not actually a dentist and he forgot to give me antibiotics and I went into a coma and I lost 80 pounds I was like dude whatever you're doing it works it's great it's like writing down like don't take antibiotics and goes back to me I think it goes back to high school I was on the wrestling team in high school I wrestled and they break everything down by weight and weight classes and I was a 215 and that was the last weight class before you go to heavy weights like it would be like 180 190 215 and heavy weight and that went all the way to 275 and if you weighed 276 pounds too bad  you you're too fat to wrestle I weighed in one day and I weighed in at 216 pounds my coach is really upsetting like Kevin you have to lose one pound but then he stopped an idea came across his head and he's like but we don't have any heavy weights so how would you feel about gaining 59 pounds as a fifteen year old sophomore in high school I think I'm against this gaining 59 pounds no do it for the team do it for the team I didn't do it at wrestling is a weird sport you have to weigh in just adult men watch you was you're in your underwear and you weigh in before it matches and there's a true story if you were ever too heavy what they do they call it a hands up they would grab you by the butt and lift your butt up a little bit so that you you'd weight less on the scale and they called it a hands up and now as an adult I realized they could have grabbed you by anywhere but they did it they chose the but that was their choice okay this isn't a joke I'm just coming through some past memories and working through some things with you guys I don't know I don't need to worry about my weight this much like my body is like the ocean scientists agree that by 2030 will be no longer able to sustain life taking great care man like I went to Taco Bell that's a great choice I want to talk about you know why it was late watching TV and an ad for Taco Bell came on I don't know if you've seen an ad for Taco Bell in the last 10 or 15 years but they all basically go like this hey are you  up okay cool come to Taco Bell I was watching like I am  up I should probably go to Taco Bell oh come on sit up there's there's tons of room I don't bite I do tickle it's much weirder I went to Taco Bell didn't tickle anybody I went there I'm placing my order I got a burrito and two tacos paid for it waiting around the guy came back and it was like sir there's a problem with your order I'm like dude you need to be more specific there are a lot of problems with this order it's 2:00 in the morning and I just ordered 3000 calories like this is a problem it's like no the problems with the deep fryer it's broken we have to fix it it's gonna take 15 minutes for you to get your burrito on two tacos and first I was upset about it but then I thought about it and I realized it should take 15 minutes to make burrito and two tacos like food should be assembled like with care and love by person for you and like like effort should be put into it it should take time so it's like alright you know instead of being upset I have to mention I was pretty high too so it's like instead of being upset I'm just gonna I'm gonna pretend that I'm getting better food than I actually am I'm gonna pretend that I'm like making healthier choices for my body like I'm gonna cosplay me as me just making more responsible choices it's great it's the easiest cosplay you ever have to do I don't even have to change clothes and that solved it for me I wasn't upset but the dude the dude working at Taco Bell he was more upset than I ever was about it he was like dude you know you're being cool I want to do something for you I want to give you two tacos for free I was like okay that's generous but I did just order and pay for two tacos I'm like that was just an impulse buy like I've never eaten a burrito I've been like  I need two tacos on top of this burrito right now like can I get my money back for the first two tacos he's like well I can't do that for you I guess we have to get the manager involved she won't go for it but I could give you four tacos for free okay but then I have six tacos like well I can give you six tacos for free only all right stop right there cuz the problem the problem is never gonna be the number of free tacos I'm grateful for every one of them they're great the problem is always the number of means there's always gonna be just one me and I have to eat all the tacos all right there's nobody else I don't have any mouths to feed like what kind of father would I be if I show up at 3 o'clock in the morning like wake up kids fourth meal come & get it I think that's on happening they don't keep like I can't have leftovers I can't crunch them up and make them into a Taco Bell casserole tomorrow all right that's not a thing don't try it at home no matter what Pinterest tells you I'm eating all of these tacos right right after you give them to me so let's just stem the damage just the original order just burrito two tacos that's more than enough food I'll be okay and he looks at me directly in the eye seems like okay I can get what you're saying but ten tacos is the most tacos I can give you for free I thought lost like I I don't know how to tell people to stop giving me things for free like it's not a problem I encounter a lot in capitalism I'm just like okay dude just just stop just just end it just just that just a burrito to tacos that's it everything will be fine it wasn't fine though I wasn't the drive-through did I mention that I probably said that up top I was in the drive-through my order is so messed up they actually asked that I leave the drive-thru and park so I'm just in the park through now and it's I just should have left it was too much cuz I'm just there it's late I'm stoned and I watch other people they drive up they order they pay for their food and they get to leave I guess they didn't order tacos I don't know what was different for them but they get to leave and I'm still there and it's too late and it's too dark I'm too stoned and like I'm going through this cycle of regret room not just regretting my order I'm not just regretting Taco Bell like it's a cycle am I going through every regret I've made in my life until I hit high school because there's just too many regrets to work out without a therapist you know so it's there it's late I'm stoned in my car I'm just thinking sophomore year you know winter formal like Rachel wanted to dance with me I want to dance with her and I got my head about it and I never asked her and then we were always weird I'm just late Stone sitting in my car trying to figure out Rachel's on Facebook or not and there's a knock on my window I'm like holy  it's Rachel it was never Rachel it was always the guy working at Taco Bell and he's just standing there smiling ear-to-ear I roll down the window and he lifts up the largest bag of tacos I've ever seen I grabbed it it was a burrito and 12 tacos I didn't count it in front of him I'm not rude I just threw it in the backseat like it was just like I'm a stranger just giving me a kilo of coke like I just threw it in the backseat peeled out I'm like I have to get out of here before somebody shows up like I lost the metaphor in my head I started worrying like what if a police officer pulls me over they're gonna know this is too many tacos for personal consumption they're gonna think that I had intend to distribute these tacos so I did the only thing I could do I destroyed the evidence I ate a burrito and 12 tacos on the ride home have you ever reached into a paper bag looking for a taco and there are no more tacos at it and that bag once had 12 tacos in it a little moment I recovered went home I got on Facebook I hit up Rachel and you know in the morning she hit me back up do you know what she said she said yeah 12 tacos is a lot of tacos to eat Kevin hey thank you guys that's been my time I mean Kevin O'Shea be a post MC all

that this guy would not shut up would it be nice it was a no small talk option on the app right but there isn't it's gonna find your own way to quiet the guy I like to scare him you know he's like how about this traffic huh what are things causing this I'm like probably the Jews he's like all right I give this ride five stars of David I live in the West Village fun fun neighborhood the gay pride parade actually goes rep up my house every day and I like a gay area I feel like gay guys are pretty great you know you know it's gotta be nice about being gay is a you don't have to wonder every other day if you're gay it's gonna be a nice just I like dick I'm going to work you know you don't have to worry about it you know you just enjoy a pool party not to be confused because that's kind of what's nice about sexual preferences you just kind of know you know you have to try it sound like food cuz I bet gay guys like proposition me on my walk home like a how do you know if you haven't tried it and I'm like well what do you my mom with Brussels sprouts maybe wrap some bacon around it you know cuz libido and appetite are very similar you get hungry eat you know hungry get horny you  get on horny you know they're very similar but my discipline with sexual appetite is so much better because I got a like coconut but if I'm gonna room on the coconut for three days event you'll be like alright I'll take it you know but if I'm in a room with like six guys for three days I can I can hold off much longer I guess that's what jail is you know just a room of the coconut for like three years like alright  it he's doing cool you guys are drinking the free beer huh yeah I like to drink my friend just quit drinking oh it's kind of a bummer a little little selfish if he asked me good for him but he quit drinking booze is really the only advice for when someone quits you get annoyed you know if your friends like I'm gonna stop doing crack or never like but what about the wedding one of my friends the real booze bag he's obsessed with breweries we gotta go to a brewery like oh I can't wait to go to a bar he's like it's fun you can see how it's made I don't care how it's made look I like porn I don't need to go to a broken home I used to drink a lot more I've cut back my phone is like my addiction now yeah I'm pills a that's great you know phone addiction way better than booze I don't know the same side effects both dangerous while driving both give me the courage to yell horrible things at strangers and both have helped me  very questionable women yeah see the problem the phone is there's no cut off like with booze you drink too much buddy go say you've had enough or your body cuts you off you pass out you just fall down you puke follow no cut off what needs like a phone bouncer just a guy like hey you can't get in you're like but that's fine that's big it's my place oh I heard a phone all right I don't know I'm just some way off my phone way more than booze like I've never been like I gotta take a  where the hell is my cocktail be  for six back end of a cocktail no cognitive or six minutes it's insane um we'll keep it moving you look pissed you don't believe me that's the joke just shut up all right we'll talk later all right cool all right oh boy what the hell was I talking about oh yeah so yeah the gays um feel like gay guys are a little better than us and they're progressive nonviolent you never made any violent gay guys there's no gay gangs that would just be a musical yes there is that offensive I don't know I can't keep up everybody's offended now you know it's okay to be offended but just shut up yeah like I had a guy yelled me that day goes hey buddy that's a trigger word I was like whoa I think it's pronounced trigger honey line I don't know um tough times I had a guy call me racist recently from that joke Ivano me just telling jokes it's weird it's quite a go to we use that word so quickly now like I was on the subway last week I was watching an interracial couple make out I was just staring out and the guy caught me he goes what the hell you got a problem with us making out woody erase us I was like wow racist noma creep let me talk about I'm hard not a racism aroused quite a leap some people abuse that word a friend of mine she's Puerto Rican we grew up together so hate going to the gym the white women there I'll give me the stink-eye cuz they're racist so go  what happened like well first to bring my food and I eat it then I play my music really loud I'm like oh maybe they just hate you let's not bring down the good people of Puerto Rico because you're a  you're vegan consider it rude you're playing music and  now what do they hate you you gotta take a loner ship can just blame bigotry will never come a better person like I was a bed-wetter I grew up in a black neighborhood I sleep with their houses eventually I stopped inviting me over it wasn't like I hate white people no I ruined their  furniture they didn't hate white they did yellow I like all the groups I've just been a girl none of that Jewish gap what's that Jewish app called the Jewish one PayPal yeah going pretty well she's a fun gal real tomcat in the sack she likes to use a vibrator in the bedroom while I watch pretty hot but you feel a little obsolete feels like I'm an employee at CBS and she's using the self-checkout I'm like yeah see you know what you're doing but if you hit a snag I'm your man after like a half-hour you're like  these robots are taking our jobs uh yeah women are going through a lot right now when I went to the women's March that was cool although I got to say I haven't heard the word  yelled that much since that time i roller bladed to high school was a tough morning ah yeah comedy you like the porn sir yeah that's all right people get all weird on that it's a big industry yeah I like porn and unfortunately change the game I feel like out of the gate now sex much kinkier than it used to be how the gay now it's like choking spitting finger up the butt which is weird cuz these are all things my older brother did to torment me you're taking bullying out on the playground brought in the bedroom I got a girl on top now I'm like Indian sunburn seriously go to a schoolyard now during recess some kids call the girl down pulling her hair calling her name's I'm like man he's good you guys ever get down on your knees and thank god you're not a pedophile no one's grateful for that we're all very lucky they didn't choose educate dealt a bad hand cuz think how close we all were when I was in third grade I was attractive third grade girls now I like adult women when I was in third grade I like grape juice now I like red wine but I still like grape juice see how close we were thank God my brains they give her the kids and hang on in that juice I recently just watched a documentary on pedophilia with my friends my friend goes oof I could never  a kid they're so annoying I was like that's it huh that's the thing that's holding you back need a better reason that all right buddy it's like hey what happened to Greg he went to prison why he met a really cool kid all right that checks out gotta be hard to be a kid now you know so much stimulus coming at you iPhone and your internet social media all the time I'm happy go-lucky where's kids hey run in the car shotgun remember that shotgun you never see that now the only time a kid yells out out now is in a classroom and all right I killed a kid yeah school shootings I like other blame in the video games video games cause violence come on video games don't cause violence video games cause carpal tunnel and vaginal dryness I know a lot of guys have played ten hours of video games a day their girlfriends like violent slap my ass choke me I'm dying here I don't think games translate to real life like we're playing Monopoly with my friends none of them now own property to be fair some did go directly to jail so there is that yeah I grew up before the internet remember those days you know you had a question hey mom what's the capital of South Dakota I'm on the phone and you just didn't know what a concept not knowing now we have some information all right at her fingertips now have an Alexa I love this thing although I just read an article said Alexa actually listens everything you

you ask Siri there we go that was before you jokes jokes at a comedy show yeah people are very uh sensitive you know feel like we're all hung up on words now aren't we it's all about words trigger words buzz word what about actions our actions was really important like I told an abortion joke recently and a woman approached me she was okay that's very insensitive I've had an abortion you shouldn't tell jokes like that I was like whoa hey sorry I just told a joke I think what you did was much worse but you know either way I'll see it home later honey and that's a joke - I love abortions I paid for - last week you know I'm a big fan honestly I don't feel like abortions get the credit for how successful they are I mean they're killing it I'm doing a great job these people

not once ever like hey I was an abortion horrible Timmy he's got no ears but they didn't charge me I don't know it's fun to say horrible things you know we're all gonna die one day don't I feel like the whole country's pent up though physically can't say  you know not good everybody's angry got white supremacists running around protest hate groups now you're allowed to be hateful in America as

this next comic he has his own special on Amazon it's a big welcome for Mike Kaplan everyone thank you everybody for that big welcome that you were requested to give me I appreciate it my hope for mark Normand who was just up here is that he becomes so successful that there are people who believe that he is Kevin Hart that is my hope that people like like kids who don't know Kevin Hart tune in to a mark set like they turn it on like after it started so they don't say it's a here's mark Normand they just see him at the end be like I'm Kevin Hart and they'll be like I love Kevin Hart and then they'll buy tickets and then they'll see Kevin Hart and they'll be like TV adds ten pounds and those different stuff that's what I hope for mark Normand I'm very funny I'll start in a minute but I I wanted to let you know I guess let me I'll demonstrate that I'm a comedian first and then I'll stop doing comedy if you're already enjoying it great if not you're right as well everybody's experience is valid so look at that one at a time I'm a man sorry ladies okay and I started doing comedy in Boston I about 1516 years ago I have been doing comedy I started at Boston University I went to school there I was officially be used funniest student in 2005 I won a competition be his funniest student which means out of 32,000 people I was the funniest of the 11 that were in the contest so pretty good start I'm wearing this this collared shirt tonight this button-down shirt because we're filming and I like to look good when I can see it later like I put this on and my girlfriend was like oh that looks really nice oh it's cuz they're filming right and she's like she's really nice but she said to me she's like I thought of a mean joke I was like you know people can see you the rest of the time as well and she's like I wouldn't say that to you but I did and here's the thing I realized that I don't not that I don't care about people about you about audiences but I guess I care more about me I'm like ooh look I look good but right now like I'm not looking at me you guys but later I might be unless they're just turning the camera on right now  all that stuff let's get going here we go Kevin art I don't even know like what in what form this is like if you're watching this streaming right now maybe you did just tuned in it's weird like today you don't just tune into things as much like you could DVR things you start at the beginning you listen to a podcast you ever you really knew a podcast and you're like well if you're just tuning in like that doesn't if you just turned on the podcast and wanted to replicate your radio experience from the past and just zoomed ahead do it all we missed the beginning well you just yeah I mean okay I didn't a sad childhood missing one time when I was thank you I'm very good in between my jokes I'm like one of the best like it I'm like you know a lot of things are about bricks but I'm like the only comedian newzik like working extensively exclusively on mortar do you understand so I think that holds it all together if you just have bricks it could fall down but if you just have mortar it looks gross so but it's probably functional probably if you had to have only bricks or only mortar I'd go with mortars Kennedy is anybody here trained to prove me wrong does anybody here have any information about architecture that I don't good I would I would definitely welcome it I don't like please heckle me with accurate math that's but only accurate math not inaccurate math here we go getting ready to get started with my set so what joke am I in the middle of I looked like this we're in this shirt you got it sometimes I'll look at video or like a picture of me on stage like after the fact and I'll see like that I'm standing like in a in a way and I'll I asked my my last girlfriend was like am i standing weird in that picture and she's like that's how you always stand and I'm like that's not that's not what I'm looking I'm looking you're not answering my question do I do I always stand weird Gary I am does any of your collaborators if you identify as not weird clapping and if you think you're not weird to people in a roomful like 50 pretty weird you know I mean you're weird if you think you're not weird right now like if everybody everybody's weird here's I was I have another friend who's a comedian and he's weird and I was telling a friend like you should check out this comedian why not saying everybody should check out Nick bad erat he's a super funny weirdo I was telling a friend she's like Mike I have to tell you something I was like oh I know I'm weird and she's like oh thank god you know so let's get started with my comedy um that's like my catchphrase that I do in between every joke is let's get started with my comedy so are you ready to comedy it's already been happening it's like the comedy by the end of my set listen let me start out before we get into comedy with a philosophical concept that I'm familiar with only recently I learned about this thing called the heap paradox do you guys know what a heap of sand is of course there's like a bunch of grains of sand how many it's not like a definitive number but it can't be one one grain of sand is not a heap - is probably not a heap three you got to be like a thousand maybe a hundred maybe a what number which one is it if it's a hundred why isn't it 101 why isn't it 99 like which one is it between two and a hundred that makes it turn into a heap which grain and the reason I'm telling you this is because this is what my comedy is like like I'll eventually be doing it but you won't know which joke which line which word turned it from not a joke into a joke for some of you it was in the middle of this joke and for some you're like still not yet but really good in between jokes I sometimes like after the end of a comedy show and every single member of the audience will come up to me individually and whisper into my ear I liked it  I know my demographic gets people who love me and understand why there are those who might not I am like the kombucha of comedy like I'm really good for you but a lot of people are like is this what it's supposed to be like and it is if you aren't enjoying it it's an acquired taste so by the end by the end of my set you'll be like that was comedy I think it was comedy the whole time I'm the M night Shyamalan of comedy M night Shyamalan II know I already I answered no before you had a chance and my Shamma Lamma dino doo-doo-doo I'm Rachael Malone oh do do do do okay so before we get started let me I'm gonna do a song for you guys it's a song with you guys a sing-along you guys up for a sing-along you know a sing-along works so here we thank you so much somebody shaking her head no you don't have to participate but the person who yelled yes you must participate so here we go you guys know how it works so here's the first verse five okay everybody sing along that's the thing the long song you don't know the word so you can't join in and there's no discernible pattern so what are you supposed to do and every time I sing the sing-along song it goes a little bit different okay so that's the first verse so you guys now understand how it goes let's do verse number two here's the second verse of the thing along song the melody and the words are different so even if you want to do participate in good faith there is very little way that you could cuz it's a joke okay so pretty good on that one let's try one more here's the third verse it's short okay let's try one more verse here here is the fourth verse it's a joke you clearly are and supposed to sing and one time there was a person who joined it because they were good at doing improv games okay so that's true but that really he really threw me off I was like how are you doing this they're like I'm just watching your mouth like real fast which is a weird sentence and I don't think I've ever said I was just watching your mouth real fast look at that it's comedy for some people now so let's see oh yeah it's been it's been almost enough time doesn't really exist but there are other comedians and I have places to be but and also places don't exist but you know it seems like they do um for more on that check out other comedy that I've done I I do have a special that's on Amazon you can it used to be on Netflix you could have seen it if it was if you had if you had Netflix where if you knew any person I 100% don't know why more than one person has Netflix like I got my password for my old roommate he got his from his parents they got their is from Kevin Bacon like why doesn't everybody do that you can give it it's now on Amazon it was previously between it was only available at Whole Foods and then Amazon took it over so pretty good I don't have to do it in the kale aisle anymore was pretty much at home there so I don't know if I give off a kale vibe but I take in kale vibes anyway um what what instruments do you play I play the Caleb Ives so sounds like I live in Brooklyn to make sense here we go I like that Brooklyn is everything now like I've seen like there's no passive/aggressive Brooklyn there's like old school you know what I mean like that's Fonzie Brooklyn Fonzie Brooklyn let's just reset and get some room tone now great that's a lot of comedians don't get room tone and the what are you gonna do at the end of your set just live the rest of your life not me not this guy I'm living my life right now I don't wait til the end I'll live when I'm dead what schrödinger's life okay so Oh somebody's snorting it was the person who didn't want to sing along with the song I'm sorry to make you feel that way but I am not sorry to make everybody else feel that way look how much joy you've brought to everybody with them laughing at your snore dude and you're right near the camera it's probably picking it up let's get a let's get a close-up with only those other cameras we don't have any other cameras okay great it's just it's all one shot like that Eminem song so I'm like the mm of nothing so I'm like the Buddhist Eminem I guess you know the mmm that doesn't exist so my special is on Amazon you can give it five stars if you like it you give it five stars even if you don't like it in fact did you guys know that you can think about how many stars are in our galaxy there's like a hundred billion so five is real low you got me I got a one star of you that I liked one star from a guy that was like I don't know about these jokes they might be good he talked too fast I'm dumb and what I like most about that one is it's more a review of himself than me you understand he was like I don't know about this but I do know about this and no thank you so just trying to finish the first couple jokes I started in 2010 I was on Last Comic Standing millions of people watched the show thousands of comedians went out for it I came in fifth place fifth place of all the comedian's that year and the better better news even better is the guy who came in fourth died so I'm fourth now and wish II didn't he was my friend but also he would have loved this joke he would have loved it he loved dark comedy he loved humor about death he liked joking about these things that we don't all talk about if he was here tonight he would uh well he couldn't what I wouldn't have the joke but if he was here sort of like Gift of the Magi woulda loved it if he could if he's a ghost in heaven that's not how it works but I would you know man named there are no ghosts in heaven I don't know if we can use all the we don't have the rights to these songs but uh would you have the wrongs do them that's when you copyright infringement I do that scene 15 just taking a year-by-year so in a couple years we'll come back tell you about 20/20 hindsight that's the theme of the next election so oh I'm sorry hey guys I'm sorry that I said election it is a it is a real like I am now in this day and age like it's more like life is more compliment like there's so much harder for a man today you know I mean and like a straight white cisgender able man so many things like I'm I'm a straight white male American Jew four out of five perfect but Oh Matt which one's not so sincerely after the 2016 election I honestly I used to know how to answer how are you do you not I mean I used to know how to answer I would be like so far so good you know I don't know the future but I'm grateful for what I've accomplished about so far so good that's what I want now after 2016 people like how are you I'm like life is a rich tapestry you know how's everything whoo everything's a lot I'm okay in like a but but I'm part of everything everything's not okay but I'm part of it and then they're gone and I don't have to talk about them anymore so don't have to know how to answer 2015 that's where we are in this set I was on America's Got Talent America's Got Talent a show where they ask you things like are you the greatest comedian out there and I think I'm I answered I was like I think I'm the greatest comedian in here pointed at my heart they did not use that date so it's a weird show to be on as a comedian your jokes are competing against how cute a child might sing for example it's like if in the Olympics the events competed against each other it's like the hurdles versus the snowmobile like what that's not even the same season like the next up the pole vault versus the javelin I put my money on the javelin probably the javelin would take the pole vaulter pretties pretty handily it's like I was I was telling jokes and I was up against a lady who she was from the circus and she shot a crossbow that was her talent I'm glad we went to separate my mic you make fun of this lady and then she shoots you with a crossbow hears I told jokes she shot a crossbow so accurately it hit a target attached to another crossbow that wouldn't fire since a target attached to another crossbow that one fires if that keeps happening eight crossbows go off in the span of about two seconds the final arrow goes into an apple that's over her own head leaving the judges to answer the question am i funnier than that crossbow and officially we both did move on to the next round so I am technically as funny as that crossbows I am this is crossbow caliber comedy right here and sincerely this is true she did not show up to the next round so I hope she's okay I don't know what happened but I do think that she would have loved this joke so thank you guys so much my name's Mike Kevin Hart Kaplan thanks so much everybody  Mike Kevin our Kaplan everybody came over my Kaplan hey guys we've got a real plunger it's a real treat to bring up next comic she's hilarious let's have a big welcome for your door at Peterson everyone thank you very much thank you it's such a I like this we got a catwalk at the show I like that very much you can

excited when I hear my phone beam I see Oscar during my ride I say get in the cars go sit next to me I say here's the plan Oscar mm-hmm we're going to Sephora and we're not going to rob the place but we're gonna take so many samples it'll feel like a heist you and I asked her would be oceans - mm-hmm it is for me and the candid and the kind of woman I travel a lot I fly all over the country mm-hmm but I hate and the fan of home and I hate to take off my coat and shoes to get through airport security um but I love picking out a brand new outfit from that conveyor belt of laptops and accessories so my god I'd never never loved it too but I will say though that kind of shopping is not for the faint of heart it's cutthroat it's like a sample sale I once come to a tussle with a man over a MacBook Air yes he keeps saying that's my MacBook Air I said but it goes with my outfit I said look at you a brown man with blue eyes you can't pull up Chrome I don't think so well this is really getting in my way the suit just know that left is part of bottles that he left oh this was this there we go guess about me I I got too close forget to close sometimes that back I I'm the kind of woman who Shops up jam that's right you heard me clear yes yes yes I'm the kind of woman who shops on Drive and I will say though I am very good at it - I have no amateur no amateur I never view 30 idols for period are you kidding man I always view all I'm not per se what to see it her and what to see a turn I bought myself one shot at a pond ran gorgeous gorgeous piece of clothing years yeah but I'll tell you one thing I'm the kind of woman if you see me out and about in a one shoulder tap you can pitch your putt and tell her that I've only shaved when I'm here too and it's not the arm but you'd expect no no no I do things my way there's about me I have you ever been disappointed before have you ever been disappointed I have you simply crap disappointment hey I was talking to a friend the other day a friend of mine and I was so disappointed she says to me Oh Janice Janice you have to check out this show called the property brothers I said the property brothers I said the property brothers the property brothers she said yes the property brothers I said brothers she said yes brothers property brothers I said what that sounds like a fabulous show two black men gained the property that they're owed true getting their 40 acres in a bureau I said I'm a lifelong member of the n-double a-c-p of course I'll watch a show cut the property brothers I'm a property sister say you can imagine I surprised I turn on the TV it's two identical white men I don't think they're siblings perhaps but they're not brothers um the nut brothers maybe Georgia hasn't the white man co-opted enough land in this country already I said cancel the whole thing get for the cancer again time for the Oprah these puddles of water to work  okay yes madam it's because of that I haven't been watching a lot of TV later yeah like a tuber - but up but do you know what I love movies I love movies oh my god I love movies I see all kinds of films okay but I will say though no matter what kind of film I see my favorite kind of movie scene is when they put the camera in the refrigerator and then the actor goes to open the fridge for a snack oh my god oh my god that is masterful Direction masterful it really makes you feel like a scared piece of cheese yes about me I know kind of woman you know people think that my life is easy and I will say that there are certain things you can do to make your life seem easier than material and the little tricks you can do little tricks you can do like for example I've been known to wear culottes during the weekend yes that makes me seem easy and wide a wide like a crop pants s effortlessness you know it really does why make a crop pants is lism listen a squirrel might run up my pant leg but not just have my assistant run up the other leg and chase it out - very easy very easy mm-hmm I wear those I wear those those off shoulder tops those off shoulder tops with a bit of elastic that stretches from showed at the chance to shoulder yes it just clings to you hose onto you for dear life that's the kind of tough that says it needs me more than I need it deals like to my underwear it's just a piece of favorite mm-hmm covered it discharged you covered in this judge Steve was a dick but the fact that I will surround with such grace and ease is what makes me seem so easy yes it is about me I am NOT I'm not single I'm not single no no no no I I've been in a relationship for seven years now it took long time yes but my boyfriend he gets he gets jealous and suspicious sometimes still but this one time he found a strand of hair that didn't belong to him or me or a coat or whatever and he takes it and he approaches me and he says well what is this I said that's the piece of hair I have sex with him you're not around give it back to ma'am give it back to me that's my special flush don't touch my sex toys no but I may love my man night I did a white man did a white man and I cornrow his hair while she sleeps then I take it all out before he wakes her any I mean he never he never suspects anything he never suspects anything and I will tell you that is the height of white privilege or you white men you sleep so soundly like nothing bad can ever happen to you let me tell you something cornrows and a white person is a bad thing to happen you better sleep with one eye open mm-hmm something else I'll do to my my height man if he falls asleep too early for my liking and without a sharpie and I'll write black don't crack on his forehead that's a good prank okay that's a very good prank I say bring back jackass and make me the star because at the very good prank ooh but I will say though as much as I I love love love the phrase black don't crack I live I live in constant fear constant fear I will grow up to become their one black who cracks my god the only reason I look so young right now is because I'm not actually older I'm not older I've been telling people that I am 42 since I was 16 just so I can see him and I'm part of something bigger than myself for all I know black don't crack is the hypothesis at best for me right now my god I mean there's evidence that suggests I should be okay like my parents and little cootie shot a you know they look good but mommy and daddy look good but I don't know I don't know I tell you I tell you one more thing one more thing that I don't like hmm I do not like catcalling mmm no I refuse to do it I don't follow up shrimps like that I don't don't follow trends but it's terrible I think it's terrible that people still they harass each other they harass strangers in this day and age is terrible why this is one jam I went to a bar by myself because I wanted to get drunk alone and I'm sitting at the bar and this man his sylars up next to me and he says my god you're so catches he was like I must have your number don't make me kiss your number I need the digits I'm good with area codes but not that good give me your number I looked at him I said I said you can follow me on Twitter like everybody else  then I took my drink and I threw it in my mouth thank you  door Peterson everybody let her hear you guys our next comedian it's real treat to have him he co produces this show and he's a real special boy let's have a big welcome for Cameron Venini everybody hey thanks for coming everyone this is where they kept the water you gotta perform for water here I've had a great day it was a day off today did anybody else have a day off you did what did you do today so went for a walk in the rain with your dog I watched cheers all day today six hours of Ted Danson I got into like my sixth or seventh episode of cheers and you know they start playing that on the theme song where it's like you know it's like making your way in the world today it takes everything you got and I just started crying unmercifully because I can't afford therapy you guys it's so good to be here last week I ran into an ex-girlfriend while using a Coinstar machine  do you know do you know what it's like to look somebody that you used to love in the eye and and tell them that things are going good cause you're pushing loose change into a machine that makes way too much noise in a crowded area nobody needs to be looking at me pushing things that I've saved up for right here like I'm just killing it in life completely ruined Coinstar day I'll say that I used to love Coinstar day Coinstar day is a holiday I made up for myself because I'm poor and it's it's awesome I try to spread this on to other people coin start day is a day just for you there's no set day for it what you do is you get one of those and I like a coffee container anything wouldn't light those cylinders that they keep liquor bottles in but you drink the liquor and then just fill that up with loose change and then once you get to the end of it you get a bunch of money back here are the rules the coin start a first rule of coin start a you have to spend all that money that day you don't save it or put it towards an education or something dumb like that second rule of coin started day you can only spend the money you make on coin start a on yourself you know I don't see are you keeping up with me here see if that means  charity it's a very selfish holiday child support any other thing that you should be spending money on for somebody else goodwill  all that you can only spend it on yourself I don't care if you have a relationship if your girlfriend's like oh it's quick start a what are we doing what are we doing it's like well we're not doing anything I'm going to Benihana alone and I'll have a grown man throw fish rip in my mouth like I'm a cape Coinstar gay even if you have to work you got to call you boss like I can't come in today it's  Coinstar today here's why Cameron I know your life sucks you need this you got last Coinstar day I bought myself a really very nice pair of headphones I got the beats by dre Coinstar Dave's looking a little bit more education now I got beats by dre and the guy at the counter told me if I wanted to I could insure them for a year for only like ten bucks and I said get me your manager because you just made an employee of the month I didn't do I got the insurance and I left and then I realized that that's like the only thing in my whole life that I have insurance for it's my  headphones it's all I can afford headphones insurance so like if if a car hits me or whatever and somebody's like oh my god sir wake up are you okay I can't get off so don't worry about me how am I beats by dre are they still working sir do you want me to call an ambulance call Best Buy call Best Buy don't know it's me I went to went to a book signing recently for the first time I've never done anything educational before I went to a book signing for a guy named Chuck Palahniuk does anybody know who Chuck Palahniuk is he's a very famous author a great guy he wrote he wrote Fight Club and a lot of other really great critically acclaimed books I've never read anything by Chuck Palin hook I'm dating somebody that loves Chuck Palahniuk and she couldn't go and we're still at that like point in the relationship where you want to like do nice things for each other so I'm like I'm not gonna watch cheaters all day today I'm gonna go to his book signing at the Strand I just thought that it would just be like something you go up he doesn't care you don't care you buy the book he signs it and you leave but he was very nice he's like hey thanks for thanks for buying my book I really appreciate that and I should have just said sure welcome you're welcome but instead I said oh no it's it's nothing I'm I'm getting I'm sorry about the confusion I know I am standing in front of you but I'm doing this for a friend and he just looked confused and he's like well thank your friend for having you buy this book and I was like no I felt like a dick I was like look it's it's a little more complicated I'm this person that I'm seeing that I'm interested in and he's like you did all this for for a lady and I yeah and he's like wait you must really care about her and I was like maybe he was like well is this gonna help and I was like oh no and then he just kind of looked at me for a minute and then he signed it and I left and I got on the train and I opened up the book and he signed it he signed it very beautifully and then underneath that he wrote good luck which is confusing right it's confusing I was a little taken aback because if at first you think like oh he's telling me good luck on your endeavors with you know this relationship but he knows that I'm giving it too it's for her so is he just like good luck with this weird  guy that was in front of me he creeped me out I don't know how you do it good luck so I had to scribble that out I scribbled out the good luck part I gave her the book she was ecstatic she opened it up she's like oh my god I was gonna get this how did you know I'm like well you  told me about it a couple of times and then she saw that it was sign it she's like oh my god it's signed you got it signed by him like yeah you know and then she's like wait what what did he write under his name what did he cross out over there and I'm like I mean I guess maybe it was like a misspelling that's probably just a mistake and she's like Chuck pallet misspelled his own name yeah I guess he's a  idiot huh I don't know why you read so much can't you just love me can't you trust me always with the books that's just a joke I assume I read I don't read a lot I read an article recently that said that um scientists this is true scientists got together and they did a study and they were able to prove what does it do I sound stupid when I bring up scientists and then talk about that subject  scientists in a room they did a study and they were able to prove that condoms have absolutely no effect on a man's sexual performance that sounds about right just one lady in the back just knew it yeah they're saying is that apparently it has nothing to do with the condom it's just somewhere between like seventy to eighty percent of of all men suffer some form of erectile dysfunction that's it that's all I wanted to say but if you think about it and I'm just gonna say this like okay fine fair enough science but like if seventy to eighty percent of all men have it then it's not a dysfunction they're just their shitty dicks they're not that good they don't do what they're supposed to seventy to eighty percent okay let me just paint a picture debarred like most men like most marriages end up 50% chance of divorce that means your dick is worse than most people's parents wanted to try now that's why I think like if you really care about somebody then you should you would you don't get them you should buy them like a vibrator or something like you really love that person you don't get them flowers get them like a bouquet of dildos or something I'm losing yes why not into not into toys every Valentine's Day if I'm dating somebody I get a vibrator it's it's a nice thing to do I don't care people get guys get like shy about this stuff you shouldn't saw it it's like having like a buddy with it's like a tool like your Bob the  Builder and you're gonna fix this just the last thing that you do  every Valentine's Day we both have fun why does it only have to be about her but what I noticed last time was now like then when I'm finished like first of all I want her to be happy I'm gonna say that first first of all I want her to be happy but what started to happen is like when I was finished she would she would continue with with the toy and I kind of feel like I was starting to become like like the host or emcee to her orgasms that makes any sense like what Kevin's been doing I come up I do a strong tan up front a solid ten up front and then it's just alright that's it for me let's all let's all make some noise for the purple butterfly boy give it up for the butterfly anyways alright thank you guys my name's Cameron  keep it going for camera and everybody I for one have never felt so pictured in a sex life before it's a real treat to bring up this next comic they have shows all over town please check out their website pile of Tears comm so big welcome for Lorelei Ramirez everybody hi how's everyone doing tonight you're so far away hi camera you can't see this but everyone's very far away so if you're watching I just want to let you know that Minister I'm really excited to be here I had a crazy day today I woke up very early in the morning I saw a dog in my room that wasn't mine and the dog started talking barking sorry barking and then and then I I was like okay I should just go to the kitchen and make myself something to eat so I started making myself something to eat and then I sorry well she's hiding sorry my best my best friend in is here this is insane I'm sorry this is really distracting because it can everyone just give a round of applause to Jen for being here so insane yeah this is so weird Jen doesn't normally come out to things like this but ever since she passed away last week she's kind of been at every show so truly a blessing so I am mixed I'm a mixed person just in case you were wondering why I looked weird you know I heard some of you screaming as I came up to the stage tonight so I just have to address it I am mixed a mixed race it's very hard being mixed there's a lot of problems you know with it one of the biggest problems as I wake up every day I look into the mirror and I scream no because I don't know which race I'm going to be that day you know like maybe I'll illustrate it for you so here's my bathroom right and then here's me and then here's my reflection and my reflections just kind of like do you know what I mean it seems like you're not getting it maybe I'm not painting a picture so here's my bathroom like my bathrooms like from here to here and then here's my toilet no the toilets here and then here's my sink and here's like a little like towel and then here's the bathtub and then here's like curtain and then over here's my dad in a little jar over there there's like people in it and then here's my reflection and my reflections just kind of like do it's really hard being mixed is what I'm trying to say but it's fine because I am part of a really cool support group for mixed people we meet in Midtown once a week in a basement and we do all these really fun exercises like we we like bump into each other in the dark we like turn all the lights off just like you know doing that and we're happy when we're doing it and we like scratch each other to see what's underneath and we fall together and we rise again and whenever anybody asks us where we're really from we all slit our  throats  here's an impression see if you can guess what this is that's me at the bank and if you were wondering there are about 10 people in front of them there's also 10 people behind me so I'm kind of like in the middle of the line and get this it's not even my bank I'm in the wrong Bank again but if that was how I talked you just see me outside waiting for each of you to follow you home where are you going let's go to about Bank I have no head there's like a little worm sticking out but it's I the eyes of the worm this worm has eyes and the eyes of the worm are like your mom's eyes so it's like very familiar so you let me follow you home and then it right at the door you're like wait a minute what the  you get really scared start shaking and you melt your body's melting your skin is melting you can't believe it when you to my face through the door I don't have an album but hey Miami you hear it forever did you just hear that of going and going you're in a psych ward what else I have a lot of anxiety you know it's gotten progressively worse since after the election please vote tomorrow by the way just saying that please please vote I saw in some of your eyes I saw I'm not going to vote so please vote and I saw please vote tomorrow yeah so my anxiety has gone progressively worse since after the election I started like you know spiraling and so I've had to start going to therapy which has been really good I'm taking medication now so that's it's really amazing it's really changed my life I really love therapy because it's allowed me to deal with my anxiety by you know kind of developing various coping mechanisms so I can you know deal with the anxiety and so now every day do these three things and I'll just share them if you need them and if I don't need these three things I kind of like lose all control and I can't really live so maybe it'll help you out for going through the same thing every day I have to do these three things I have to eat at least three times a day I have to move my body around or exercise to make sure I'm really there and I have to collect my thoughts or meditate you know just to do that and when none of those things works I close my eyes I take a deep breath and I think about the knife dildo from the movie se7en and I'm like everything's gonna be okay the human imagination is limitless knife dildo from the movie se7en here's another impression see if you can guess what this is hey mister I could suck your dick if you want me to that is whatever you want it to be okay now we're we're getting to the good stuff here if you know I love doing this making people laugh is fun but that's not what I or God sent me here for if you couldn't tell from the sound of my voice I do write poetry and I'm going to read some for you tonight and I would say this is where the comedy is stops and where you can just allow yourself to feel okay so I'm gonna read from this book of poems that I wrote and I am selling after the show yeah that's it but I have to get ready first just give me a second   okay this first poem is about my father we had a very tumultuous relationship he used me as a perm once my father is a blender when he is full of berries he begins to scream in agonizing pain he calls out for help help he twists and turns and spills out gunky shakes and screams and cries until he stops and from his beautiful tired mouth a smoothie just for me thank you so much this next one is about a lost love of mine this is a love that never was and let's just say it wasn't my fault it's just called Lotte man I made a man out of 50 lattes I took the phone and constructed him put a hat on his foamy head made arrangements to his face to make him seem like he was happy to see me happy that I was there I outstretched his arms but foam doesn't work like that it never does so I just made him lay on the ground so I could look at him and smile back take off my clothes and lay onto him feeling him disappear underneath me turning into a puddle of milk mine my milk man what is I should probably try making another one thank you thank you so much what if I never read anything like you guys clearly saw that I wasn't turning any pages this is an hour everyone's really mad at me okay so I think I'm gonna end it all and a short little thing thank you so much for letting me fool around here today and if you want to buy a zine please I know it seems like a joke but it's not I know it's funny for you to laugh at my life but who will be laughing when I follow you home you know just just come to me and you can buy one or just say hi thank you  Lorelei Ramirez will be saltines after the show and check out their website pile of Tears calm with that are you guys ready for tonight's a headliner are you guys ready for a night to have lighter make some noise he is freshmen in town from the broad frost let's have big welcome from the our sweet little boy from Candyland Shan Torres everybody it's me your headliner going last is would have been a more appropriate way to put it look at me I made it I am on a soundstage this microphone smells like when old people sneeze you know when they do that and you're like you're almost done now well I'm sorry how about a why don't everything bagels cost more will that be a little better to start with instead the dark stuff is that not crazy to any of you that everything bagels are the only thing that come with everything then the cost the same is it coming with nothing that's not  nuts and if you really think about it the people buying playing bagels are getting  that's weird mmm oh it's good to be here I think is very interesting is about New York is that uh everybody who moves here moves here with a very grand idea of what they are going to accomplish when they get here that makes sense like nobody moves this town is you know what I really want to do is pay four grand a month to live in a room with no windows like everybody who moves here is like I'm gonna be on Broadway or I'll pay for the Yankees you know I moved here to be the biggest comedian in the world that spot just keeps opening up but you know you move here you think gonna have like these New York moments you know so you watch too many Katherine Heigl movies or whatever anyway yeah Christ I'm never kissing Bradley Cooper though there's other New York moments that are horrible and they usually involve piss but I had some good ones at a what happened three years ago I was on this very Street on 34th Street and I was sitting in a coffee shop writing jokes not these ones and I got a call on my cell phone what else would I get a call on but the Horn of Gondor your laugh is haunting I but I picked it up and it was the Booker of a late night show I'd been sending him clips for over a year trying to get my act on the show and finally he says he goes if this is the set you want to do on the show this is the set you'll do on the show and I said it is the said I wanted to do he said great he told me the date March 8th you guys remember it was big for me huge for you but then I hung up a phone I started crying I don't know what you guys know about stand-up but like the first time one of us doesn't late night for us that's like getting into a good college or you know like or getting drafted or something it's like in the NFL not not the one that's coming back but clean myself up when I finish my Frappuccino yeah I like I like those they're good like 40 grams of sugar but uh I walked outside and I saw the Empire State Building I just started crying oh they look at you man you're from a dumpy little town in Texas south side of nowhere and here you are in New York City running down your dreams like Tom Petty good for you and then I ran down to my subway stop and a hobo coughed in my mouth have you ever shared the devil's kiss and Oh be honest my first reaction was just not remember cuz I had never made that noise before but I gathered myself I walk upstairs to the Walgreens and I went up to the young man behind the counter and I said excuse me sir where is your mouthwash I have a new disease and he didn't even say anything he just goes which made it so much scarier and I went back found the mouthwash stole it and I walk outside and I just open it up and just started using it on 34th Street like a psycho just spitting it out everywhere on polish tourists sneakers and stuff and as I speak when this I locked eyes with a young mother and her child I was like ah and I got so embarrassed and I wanted to spin it out but I so embarrassed and it's getting hotter and hotter in my mouth so it's just like I had a decision to make and I just mmm and just took it down yeah and in that moment I realized that I was there New York moment remember the time we saw the guy from TV drinking Listerine New York I just I just had a friend get sober have y'all ever had someone do that to your friendship what a bummer that is like what I mean it says I've never had a friend whose sobriety was less irritating than their addiction was troubling him I had a meeting it's like I got a that's right he was the funnest drunk I've ever met in my entire life he was awesome I called me like hey man we're gonna go out and have a few cocktails tonight what do you say and he'd be like yeah  child support like he was fun it's like I'm having a barbecue dude he's like I'm gonna be on pills at it yes now he's sober when he caught a touch of Christ and all we do is go to dinner at Applebee's Oh worst restaurant his name is Todd right and here's one of the things that's very upsetting about Todd sobriety is uh now he thinks he's better than everybody else cause he doesn't drink anymore it's like a real cheeky little  like we'll be out to dinner and he'll just say something kind of shitty like I just make are you really gonna have a fourth bottle of wine with dinner it's a guitar I value with my carrot cake I'm not the one with the goddamn problem at the table all of a sudden you're not parking on your neighbor's lawn at 4:00 in the morning you're better than everybody else huh Todd that's a dumbass name obviously who the hell looks at a newborn baby not yet having sand in this world and thinks I'm gonna name it Todd do you want it to be done let me give a baby an old man's name like Larry like hey this is my son Larry the baby yes he is already selling insurance thank you for asking it's the live feed still good yeah yeah okay yes they're double this amount of people watching this on the Internet you are the lucky few by far the most irritating thing about Todd sobriety has been that he now remembers his dreams is there anything more  boring than having someone recall a dream to you Jesus cry their learned and church I owe its but yes tell me about the thought that was so stupid you couldn't bring it into consciousness well I dreamed all dogs had human pubic hair great I really wanted that before my coffee I love that no one sat in the front row by the way like I don't understand though why people think it's okay to tell people about their dreams it's rude truly no one has ever been like well let me get a chair like one person ever talked about having a dream and we should have kept hearing about it yeah dr. King that's the dream worth hearing about what's your dream about again dr. King's I just think people should be treated equally no matter what well that sounds pretty good hold on one second what do you got Todd well I was at Applebee's and carrot top was my waiter again spoke backwards the whole time hands were huge it's weird idiot dr. King anything else well I have this dream that one day my four children be treated equally on the content of their character not the color of their skin I doesn't even sound like it should be a dream just the way we do  Todd well I was banging this chick and her face was blurred out like slenderman's well that does seem interesting that this is more important dr. King anything else I was trading the one day every Valley will be made high and every mountain will be made low I have a dream that every crooked place will make straight and every narrow place will be made wide I have a dream that this nation will and the true meaning of its Creed that all men are created equal that's my dream dream man I'll be honest you hit that ball so hard it's probably never gonna land Todd well we were banging and banging and then when I came her face came into focus and it was my dad and pretty much what I thought it was gonna be you're a doctor what do you think that means oh man I'm trying to get to the point I want to be a better partner a better boyfriend and I really just want to get to the point where I don't want my girlfriend to feel like she is raising me like that would be huge for me like like I was as I was complaining about how every comedian has turned out to be a sexual predator that I've admired in the past 20 it was really bumming me out no sad and I was like I grew up on The Cosby Show and Bill Cosby meant everything to me and my mom was an immigrant I was the only show she could watch and then it's like and then Louie and I'm so upset I don't have anyone to look up to and she just goes well maybe you should be the man you want to look up to I know it's lack that seems hard I'll be miserable instead cut the crust off of this for me it's just like I can't handle it anymore like if like any time someone starts a sentence with like hey did you hear about Tom Hanks I was like oh god not him - there's like they're making another Da Vinci Code yes nobody likes those I swear to God if the rock does something wrong I am just walking into the ocean I can't anymore and it's like this is weird and this look I'm entranced I do feel right now that masculinity is the best it has ever been and simultaneously without a doubt the worst it has ever been and I don't know how we did it but we did but it part of it I think it's because we know more more aware of what you know what we've had that we weren't aware of before to have the privileges we've had but now we're just not doing anything which makes it way worse and I feel that part of that may be because we don't there used to be and all of this is good I'm not don't put this on a blog or anything like I I'm not all of a sudden about to be like and Trump is a great president like I am NOT going that route I'm just trying to figure thing to figure out how to be a better man and I'm failing all the time with the best of intentions I don't have a map anymore like my father was just like and his father would just be like well we work and you raise the kids and that's not the way it's done anymore and that is good yes that map is gone but now I have no  map and I am lost I am drawing my own directions have you ever had to do that this joke  sucks and I was doing well I know I was trying with spilling myself a little too much I get it pastes magazine you know what though they get this over at the onion when I do their gigs I yeah suck it where were you on that one drummer there's a thought there that doesn't make me crazy I see your judgey little eyes I don't need this  from you I've been on TV and now I am on a live web stream thank you clearly that late-night show has changed my life I'll finish with a joke finger ah is there a grosser sounding word than fingering finger okay fine egg and that is the thing I have been doing sexually the longest like aside from kissing I wasn't like no this first let me hold you like a Nerf ball my love it's like like it's a gross sounding word but the actual act sounds gross have you ever done that in a completely quiet room cuz the noise it produces is horrified I mean I swear if you're doing that you better flip on a window unit or put on a Prince album because it sounds like you're getting hot oatmeal out of a cold bowl certainly I'm not done I have more fingering material did y'all know that that used to mean something else if you fingered someone like in the 30s like in the 1930s when you ratted out a mobster like you fingered them well where did that change happen some guy gets out of jail he's like who fingered me he and everybody is like just like stop saying and it doesn't mean that anymore by the way it was loose lips Larry same name different meanings do you guys think it's weird that you won't go to the funeral of everyone you've ever  good night everybody  shing torres everybody let them hear it guys let's men are shown thank you guys for coming out so much for the first pace showcase let's hear for all the comics we guys how tonight keep it going to pace for all the free beer brooklyn brewing free free free pizza also from paste guys I've been Kevin O'Shea thank you guys for coming out so much have a good night go home safe you"

thing I was like well they were free at the bar she was like Ah that's gross I was like well that's where I got you foreign  the gals I try to be a good feminist I do which is tough nowadays because some women are feminists and some women aren't so as a guy how do I know how to act like some girls you open the door for them they're like wow a gentleman thank you very much other girls you open the door for them they're like what you think I can't open my own door I'm like whoa hey I'm just trying to sleep with you yes Louise how do we get here I do feel sorry for women when it comes to sex though I think you guys get screwed over you know guys sex with a lot of girls he's a cool guy a girl has sex with a lot of guys everybody makes fun of her that's not fair it's a double standard I hate when guys pull this move they go you know I had sex with that girl I'm the man and you go yeah well she had sex with him too and like oh what a well that's not fair how come she's a now come showing a  when she had sex with you you never hear a guy say that she banged me what a wow you've got some problems sister get your act together this this is a wake-up call I feel like we're so mean the promiscuous girls in the society aren't we she's loose she's easy well what is that don't we all like sex while we get mad at the one group giving it away yeah we all like Banana Republic if they have a sale nobody calls them a I don't get it we got a black president now gay marriage is legal here yet are still oppressed yeah that's the one group in this country that still gets stepped on and I'm the only guys to get up for these women even women stick up for him those Luts are ruin it for everybody no you could put out too I genuinely don't understand I feel like if we're gonna make fun of a group of girls let's make fun of the prude girls right they're the boring annoying ones let's kick them off the high horse they've had it too good for too long all right yeah yeah why do we reward these women no I don't put out till three months in a relationship yeah you have nothing else to offer get a personality got it come on kick it up a notch let's go because let's be honest you know prude girls they're like Mom and Pop shops we all pretend to like them but they're more expensive and they close early promiscuous girls are like Walmart all right everybody makes fun of them everybody talks down to them when you're inside one at four in the morning you're like man I'm glad these are around oh my God all right hey gonna be here in La a lot of uh pretty gals here uh I find it hard to approach women at a bar I feel like women should hit on men more hit on us ladies you can say whatever you want to a guy I had an old lady approached me once she goes ooh I'm gonna kidnap you I was like wow I can never say that to a woman laughs I said that to a lady she calls the police I would be curious to know what a woman could say that would offend me like all right I'm gonna take you home drug you take advantage you and film it I'd be like all right well at least let me pay for the Uber I'm just jealous of you gals you have options you have the freedom to say no like if a girl goes on a date with a guy and this guy takes out his Nazi memorabilia she's like I get the hell out of here if I go on date with a girl she takes out her Nazi memorabilia I'm like I gotta bang her and get the hell out of here will be a long winner I don't know It's just tough to date now you know we have no patience anymore we want everything immediately now we want everything quick we want Uber Tinder Netflix everything's so quick now the only thing we don't want quick is sex when's that gonna catch up yeah I was with the girl the other night I finished kind of early she's like hey what's going on here I was like well these are the times we're living in come on I don't the patience for your vagina to be buffering let's go um gals are so sexy you're driving me crazy this is how sexy girls are I was out to dinner once this girl leans over during the meal and goes hey I'm not wearing any underwear I was like oh my God that's hot then I realized why is that sexy has underwear ever been a huge obstacle for a guy has any guy ever taken a girl's jeans off seeing panties been like it's gonna be a long night put a pot of coffee on I can't crack that code but that's how hot you are gals you can tell my article of clothing you're not wearing I can't even see it missing I'm already turned on doesn't work for me as a guy I can't pull that off I lean over during dinner hey I'm not wearing any underwear she's gonna go uh oh what happened I learned the hard way you can't say sex on a date girls hate that it's like saying bomb at the airport the whole thing shuts down you know it's weird we all like sex it feels good but you can't bring it up the only way to get the thing you want is to pretend like you don't want it that's weird Behavior what if job interviews were like that so Mark why do you want to work here who says I want to work here I don't know maybe it's me maybe I'm screwed up sexually you know I caught my parents having sex when I was eight 21 and today the idea of your parents having sex is so horrifying isn't it that's why I'm surprised parents don't use that as a threat wouldn't that be so effective like hey Timmy better clean that room me and your mom are gonna go at it  how you doing that math test Billy I got a D I'll show you some d ude I don't know the gays have it figured out yeah I love a good game my roommate's gay I like having a gay roommate he's gay I'm broke I feel like poor people and gay people a lot in common you know right we're both born that way yeah yeah women just want to be our friends and uh when you finally tell your parents they're like yeah we knew foreign a couple months ago still sore had a good time yeah uh they had the homophobic guys out there with the big signs you know how much you have to hate a group to make a sign I've never made a sign of my whole life these people are more prejudiced I am productive yeah the markers the poster board I don't get it your tactic for fighting gays is arts and crafts might want to rethink that one ironically the group you hate the most really possess up that poster I have the worst gaydar in the world too I can't tell who's gay I didn't know my roommate was gay until we had sex that's why the Bible's a real Buzz Kill huh they don't like anything fun the Bible hates gays they hate trans that's gonna be great we're doing stuff so sexually Advanced not even in the Bible you know like I love having sex with my robot the guy's like all right you're good maybe I'll try it and uh sorry if I offend anybody and now I'm trying to be more PC I'm not good with the PC you know I find it very phony you know you know PC's phony because you never use it in emergency it's too many syllables the words would take too long you know people are hurt you got to help them you don't have time to be Progressive you gotta be quick like if you saw a Chinese guy get into a car accident run over a black guy you can't be like oh my God officer come quick it's been a terrible tragedy an Asian American man got into a car accident not cause they're bad drivers he ran over an African-American gentleman who's crossed the street slowly not because they do that and uh come quick the guy's really hurt he's driving in a pool of his own blood no cause they can't swim  I like to drink I've got a bit of a problem uh I got really drunk last night was incredibly hungover today had another beer hangover went away isn't that the amazing thing about booze the thing that causes the problem is also the solution yeah I wish other problems were like that you know like you have sex with a girl she gets pregnant have sex with her again no more baby oh man that would be amazing you know then you're guaranteed to get laid at least twice you know you're talking like last night was incredible we should do that again no I think I'm gonna go home hey I'm just being responsible I go to a lot of bars my friend actually works at a gay bar so I'll go there from time to time get a free drink maybe a compliment my guy friends are blown away by this they're like dude you go to gay bars that is weird if some gay guy ever hit on me I don't know what I would do how about you just not have sex with them pretty easy sometimes I wish I was gay seems pretty good you know easy to hook up couple mimosas fix up a neighborhood it's fantastic you know but you know do like the ladies big fan of the gals uh which is weird because when I was a kid I hated girls when I was like six years old I thought girls were gross thought they were dumb you know you're allowed to hate girls as a kid that's really the only group a kid's allowed to hate because if I was a six-year-old that hated Puerto Ricans that would be weird you know if I was like hey Mom I hate Puerto Rican she would never say oh you'll like them one day all right hey any Puerto Ricans here all right too many I uh yeah just kidding just kidding love Puerto Ricans good people good people uh very passionate people a lot of knives but passion very passionate uh uh hey I'm just telling jokes I'm a comedian like like I live in New York City all right if I was racist I would be exhausted let's all take it easy huh um but you guys are a great crowd some people get so offended by these jokes the gay joke the Puerto Rican joke I got yelled at by a guy recently on the show this guy comes up and goes hey buddy I'm gay and Puerto Rican all right I don't appreciate those jokes you know how hard my life is I was like whoa take it easy how hard your life is dude you have the most parades yes all right yeah yeah I don't know race is always such a touchy issue we're all so uncomfortable with our race these days you know especially white people we're all scared of looking racist that's a big fear we have like I was talking to one guy in my last day job and I was like hey man what's the name of that new guy on the fifth floor the really tall black guy and this guy goes whoa  I don't see color like really did you really just say that that really just come out of your face so I looked this guy right in the eye and I was like hey man it's cool I'm black and he was like no you're not and I'm like ah yeah you may not be racist but you are a liar oh boy I'll tell you I was the uh I was the victim of racism recently I should tell you I love Jewish women that's my number one love the Jewish any Jewish gals here all right hey Shalom um love Jewish women I was actually lucky enough to date a Jewish girl for a while we talked about getting married and her dad made us break up because I'm not Jewish and I was like come on really seriously like I live in New York I have curly hair I'm circumcised I'm a comedian I'm like right there  still still he was like no no my daughter will only marry a Jew I want my people to live on out my culture to live on Jews are all about living on that's when I thought man Jews must be really jealous of gay people because gay people can't even reproduce yet they keep popping up sitting around like he got to marry a Jew you got to marry Jew and gays are like we'll be fine hey how you guys doing all right hey good to be here uh it's nice to be here again I like performing here it's not too Swanky you know I hate performing plays that are real Swanky I did a show yesterday at a place with a bathroom attendant yeah I had a fun moment I walked in the bathroom intended peeing the tables have turned so I go up behind him with a paper towel I hand it to him I wait for a tip he looks at me like I'm crazy and I went exactly flew here yesterday I hate flying that's the only part of this job I hate I like a train give me an Amtrak any day huh no bag check no security it's amazing I hate flying flying is so high maintenance flying's like a high maintenance chick like you want to get inside me got here an hour early take your shoes off and do a body scan you're like Jesus Christ Lord not a train a train's like a drunk chick like get a beer get in here  no security on a train whatsoever you could walk on a train with three suitcase full of cocaine like hey see something say something this is how sad and lonely trains are trains don't have to see your ticket until the train has left the station they've already started moving and then they ask how much do they really care tickets Please I don't have one we gotta buy one now I don't have any money we'll figure it out yeah I was hungover on the flight I drink too much on what you call a function alcoholic any function alcoholics here hey all right yeah yeah yeah I um I don't function we got a bad rap huh you know we're actually harder working than everyone else we're doing the same stuff you're doing drunk all right where's our parade what Bob should have to work on time screw Bob I slept here I feel like uh you got a drink now that the news is crazy so much stuff going on a lot of racial stuff oh I uh I'm not racist I look at racism the same way I look at Nickelback yeah it's fun to joke about but uh you never want to see it live foreign I feel like you can't really be racist these days you know you lose your job you make headlines you get ostracized from society it's very risky to be racist nowadays that's why if anyone's ever racist around you now you know they trust you yeah it's kind of this weird Bittersweet moment you know if you're on a smoke break with some guys like man I can't stand Mexicans you're like holy hell you're full of hate but I didn't know we were so close I um I grew up in the South too I've seen some crazy stuff I grew up with this guy hates minorities hates them all Jewish black Mexican Asian whatever but he just had a baby which I find strange because babies and minorities have all the same negative stereotypes if you hate minorities you date babies too I mean think about it babies are loud in movie theaters they can't swim they all look alike they're lazy they don't work they can't drive they never tip yeah they come to this country not knowing the language oh you can almost hear the blogs heating up  a single guy back on the scene uh hey all right prove it always bring your own condom that's what I say Sir yeah I uh it's fooling around the girl recently she goes hey Dave economy I said I forgot she goes I might have one she starts digging through her stuff she finds One Magnum oh damn it this went from a good time to a challenge all right well let's give it a whirl why not so she ripped it open she rolled it on and it fit it fit and I gotta tell you people that is a man's version of Cinderella right there yeah single my last girlfriend dumped me said I wasn't manly enough for her and I'm a manly guy that one hurt yeah I didn't know we were allowed to say stuff like that like I'm all about equality but how about a woman can say something like yeah that guy was good with his hands he could fix stuff around the house and you're like all right cool but if a guy says hey like a woman who can cook people go whoa whoa It's not the 50s how come her job for me is okay my driver isn't okay also who doesn't like somebody can fix stuff around the house I'd love to come home my girlfriend's like hey Bill's a deck hungry see I think women are really smart because you guys made your gender roles offensive yeah that was very clever well played ladies well played guys how great would that be if we get offended hey girlfriend wakes you at 4am I heard glass shattering somebody break in you're like well it's not the 50s go check it out  good to be here a little hungover uh runs in the family my dad's

well it's not what I expected but I like these too oh yeah I'm on board with gay marriage I like gay marriage and I'll tell you why I like gay marriage because it's that one big issue you can be honest about and still look like a good person let me explain like if somebody says hey man how'd you feel about that earthquake in Haiti I don't care done affect my life wow what a dick but if somebody says hey man how do you feel about gays getting married I don't care doesn't affect my life you got the right attitude very Progressive open-minded I like that guy oh yeah I don't get the whole homophobia thing that's what we're winning homophobes here I uh I did some shows in the South recently I was talking this guy after the show I told him about a friend of mine who's gay this guy goes you have a gay friend I wouldn't even shake a gay man's hand I was like Jesus Christ why not he goes you know how many dicks are on that hand I was like well you shook my handy okay with my dick because uh there's a lot of interaction between the two all right yeah yeah wow that is terrible logic you know who else touches a lot of dicks women Yeah man they put them all over you're screwed can't touch anything now come on I don't know I think homophobia can actually be kind of dangerous you know a friend of mine he's kind of a tough guy he went skydiving recently he's like yeah I'm not strapping some guy in my back that's super gay now he's dead there you go all right I'm not gay do like the ladies big fan of the old labia oh yeah which is weird because when I was a kid I hated girls when I was like six years old I thought girls were gross thought they were dumb you know you're allowed to hate girls as a kid but that's really the only group a kid's allowed to hate if I was a six-year-old that hated Puerto Ricans that would be weird you know I was like hey Mom I hate Puerto Rican she would never say oh you'll like them one day they don't like them a lot hey all right any Puerto Ricans here all right too many oh yeah just kidding love a good party good people very passionate people a lot of knives we're passionate people there yeah yeah these are all just jokes take it easy uh look look I live in New York City all right if I was if I was racist I would be exhausted so uh so I'll just have a good time huh sorry black guy didn't mean to make eye contact with you there uh was an accident my eyes went there thanks for coming out good to have you gotta color this up a bit um I don't know I feel like everybody's so phony nowadays when it comes to race everybody's so PC trying to prove they're not racist at every moment I was at a Starbucks last week I'm talking to my friend I was like yeah you know my neighbor he's this Mexican guy and before I could finish the sentence this lady stands up and goes hey I didn't come here to listen to some racist conversation I was like yeah that'd be weird if you did it's a coffee shop who would come here for that also I said the word Mexican because he is Mexican that's not a slur that's not a bad word sounds like you have some problem with Mexicans you're projecting that onto me all right that'd be like if I said yeah this four-year-old the other day and he went whoa you're giving me a bone or you pedophile come on I don't know like I have four black friends right now it's the best I've ever done and um that's two of them right there and uh you know all my black friends tell me I'm the whitest guy they know which I'm not sure what that means I guess because I say words like skedaddle I don't know um I get that all the time but maybe I am super white but I think the whitest thing about me is the fact that after I get a haircut I like to leave the barbershop for all the hanging around you know hey you know this office that was a hell of a root canal and I'm gonna sit in the lobby for four hours yeah and I know some people are like hey buddy that's a stereotype well they made three movies about it so you figure it out yeah  I don't know I'm learning a lot from my black friends I'm learning black guys don't get offended by much it's only white people on behalf of black people which is very condescending you know like uh I was at a party recently I was talking to a friend of mine black guy I had a couple beers with me and I was like hey man I gotta ask you what's up with the whole no swimming stereotype and my friend was like yeah we just grew up in the inner city we'd have a pool around we'd have a lake to go to I was like oh now I know and this guy at the party goes hey man that was ignorant I was like yeah that's why I asked the question now I know more about it how are we gonna get anywhere if we can't learn  all right you're mad at me for trying to learn about it what does this guy do just walk to an African sticks class like you guys all make me sick just trying to learn just because something makes you feel uncomfortable for four seconds that means a bad thing if we did that with everything we wouldn't learn anything now your dad's like hey son I'm gonna teach you about the birds and the bees oh that makes me uncomfortable Dad look I know girls pee out of their butts I'm gonna leave it at that hmm yeah I uh I joke about race but I hate seeing racism in front of me it's brutal I used to live with an Asian guy a Chinese guy and uh one time we were walking around in Brooklyn somebody called him a  he was devastated but can we all agree that's definitely the gentlest of the racial slurs I mean come on he's from China he's a man not so bad all right to me I think the names of Chinese restaurants sound a lot more like racial slurs let's try some you know who can't drive those God damn Panda Kings I'll tell you that right now yeah and listen to this one of those golden noodles is one of my apartment building those guys really burned me up those Lucky Dragons race just isn't a big deal to me I grew up in a black neighborhood in New Orleans I grew up in a mansion in an all-black neighborhood oh yeah those guys hated me yeah my bike got stolen a million times yeah you got to the point where at Christmas my mom would buy me a new bike and I was like oh my God Mom what are you doing this is way too small for Jamal he is gonna kick my ass yeah and you know a lot of people say to me hey Mark you grew up in a black neighborhood and you sound like that oh yeah this is how I rebelled I was like oh you don't like my people I'm going 1940s Auctioneer on you honey like that huh yeah all right well you guys are a good crowd some crowds everybody's so offended nowadays about jokes tweeting and blogging about how pissed off they are I got heckled the other night I call this guy a douchebag this lady comes up here that word that's a mean word my son has Down syndrome I was like all right fair enough but I also use the word douchebag that's a mean word where's that Mom how come you never see that hey you know word my son huge douche oh yeah he wants to be a DJ I don't know what to do I'll tell you nothing but e-cigarettes and fedoras is the worst oh yeah oh boy so I'm having a beer tonight I'm gonna probably get pretty sloppy I gotta I gotta cut back on the booze I drink way too much uh my uncle is actually 30 years sober can I believe that 30 years sober yeah the other night I was like oh man I got so drunk I lost my phone my uncle's like oh yeah I did that once I was like wow you know how drunk you have to be lose your phone 30 years ago holy hell are you telling me you got a hammer and lost a landline all right now why do you quit boozing those were attached to the wall all right yeah I go to a lot of bars I notice there's a lot of girls at the bars these days flirting with guys just for the free drinks you know you're not gonna put out but you want those drinks pretty good move makes you wonder you think there's ever been any smart kids out there who would flirt with pedophiles just for the candy yeah you know you're like hey Timmy don't talk to that guy he's a child molester I know what I'm doing yeah gotta get these Skittles somehow um I went out to a bar last night uh trying to meet some ladies uh yeah I actually ended up talking to one girl bar last night she was pretty cute although uh I don't get too crass here but she kept talking about her her period and I was like oh can we talk about something else and she was like oh yeah sorry let me just tell you about my day and I was like let's go back to the period good Lord I know it's gross but at least it's interesting all right come on I don't care that you're a barista let's get back to that heavy flow huh yes I'm a boy oh boy that's one thing I'll say I'll say about the ladies and I don't mean to generalize here I'm just talking about you know the majority of you is um women are also insecure about how they look you always hear that do you think I'm pretty do you think I look good do you think I'm fat you all look great every color is beautiful very attractive gorgeous I wish women were more insecure about their conversation skills yeah every time I'm watching a movie my girlfriend walks in can you believe my aunt said I'm like I can't believe you think I care insane where are you getting the balls just walk in hide earbuds in who do you think you are Geez Louise never got that you know all these questions do these jeans make me look fat do these jeans make me look fat I've never heard a woman once say is this conversation even relevant anything here at all anything you're tuning out I don't blame you yeah stop one of you don't look fat no one's fat man you're not fat you're not fat you're not fat but I bet you're boring oh shut up I don't know her I actually uh bumped in a girl on the street recently in Manhattan that I used to uh you know bang um Tomcat in the sack real firecracker but she would always say things in bed that would just kind of backfire like I remember one time she looked me right in the eye she goes around me I never want to see your penis soft and I know she was trying to sound hot but it just came off as terrifying I felt like I was in a boxing movie I was like come on buddy don't go down hang in there you can do it a couple more rounds come on I gotta be honest ladies once she said that I had ended with her I had to stop seeing her because ladies you got to realize the soft penis that's who guys really are all right it's the real guy deep down everybody loves a boner but that's if you were a cocktail party I'm a guy who likes to sit at home on the couch eating potato chips that's a flaccid penis see what I'm saying the boner's amazing I have way more in common with my soft wrinkly disgusting flaccess of penis than I ever willed my erection my boner's strong confident got great posture I'm nervous and secure and Squishy ladies you can't tell a guy that come on I tell a guy hey I never want to see you soft that's like me telling a girl hey I never want to see you without makeup my boner is my mascara that's all I have oh boy I wish that wasn't true I gotta tell you this might be the best I've ever done um I do not go over all the time so this is nice ah yeah I think uh my problem with the ladies is I want you all to like me that's my problem you gal's uh you're tough nut to crack because you're all different that's the thing you know like some girls like a nice guy some girls like jerks so how do you know what I do I do both I've seen attractive lady I open the door for and I say after you fatty mix it up cover your bases you know but you know and these are all just jokes about women I love the ladies I try to be a good feminist I do which is tough nowadays because some women are feminists and some women aren't so as a guy how do I know how to act you know like some girls you open the door for them they're like wow a gentleman thank you very much other girls you open the door for them they're like wait you think I can't open my own door I'm like whoa hey I'm just trying to bang you yeah geez Louise how do we get here good Lord I have never paid for sex so anybody here ever pay for it all right yeah get a shot of that guy so his grandmother can see this yeah there you go all right good for you buddy I don't think there's anything wrong with paying for sex creepy guy I really don't you know sex is just a need like anything else why is that the one need we have where it's frowned upon if you pay for it we don't do that with any other needs you know no one's ever like ah come on man you paid for those groceries you're a young guy you should be farming get out there plant some seeds one of my friends he gets laid all the time he's one of these guys that complains about condoms I hate when people complain about condoms dude you're putting your penis inside of a woman shut up all right it's a thin layer of latex you're not eating food with the wrapper on it you're getting laid get over it all right well you just can't have anything between you and someone else's dad's like hey son give me a hug we'll get that goddamn shirt off Dad yeah I want to feel this hug for once come on you know what I don't understand is condom commercials how much is people having sex in the commercial look if you're buying condoms you're already getting laid I feel like if you want to sell some condoms have a commercial with a screaming baby and a guy crying in front of WebMD heaven yeah that's how you move some rubbers you know just the guy pissing fire like ah why didn't I back it up Trojan that's it  oh boy but I think if we're talking about ladies we're talking about sex I got to bring this up I think women get the short end of the stick in the whole sixth game you know guys sex with a lot of girls he's a cool guy girl has sex a lot of guys everybody makes fun of her that's not fair it's a double standard I hate when guys pull this move they go hey you know I had sex with that girl I'm the man and you go yeah well she had sex with him too and they go oh what a  well that's not fair how come she's a  now come she want to see that when she banged you you never hear a guy say that oh she slept with me what a  wow you've got some problems sister get your act together this this is a wake-up call I feel like we're so mean to promiscuous girls in the society aren't we   she's loose she's easy well what is that don't we all like sex where I'm getting mad at the one group giving it away you know we all like Banana Republic but they have a sale nobody calls them a  I don't get it we got a black president now gay marriage is legal yet  are still oppressed that's the one group in this country that still gets stepped on and I'm the only way guys sticking up for these women all right even women won't stick up for him those  are ruin it for everybody no you could put out too I genuinely don't understand it I feel like if we're gonna make fun of a group of girls let's make fun of the prude girls right they're the boring annoying ones let's kick them off the high horse they've had it too good for too long why do we reward these women I don't put out till three months into a relationship yeah except nothing else to offer get a personality come on Kick It Up a nuts let's go let's be honest you know crude girls they're like Mom and Pop shops we all pretend to like them but they're more expensive

things in bed that would just kind of backfire like I remember one time she looked me right in the eye she goes around me I never want to see your penis soft and I know she was trying to sound hot but it just came off as terrifying I felt like I was in a boxing movie I was like come on buddy don't go down hang in there you can do it a couple more rounds come on I got to be honest ladies once she said that I'd to end it with her I had to stop seeing her cuz ladies you got to realize the soft penis that's who guys really are right that's the real guy deep down everybody loves a boner but that's not the real you all right that's the cool guy that's you when you turn it on that's you at a job interview or a cocktail party I'm the guy who likes to sit at home on the couch eating potato chips that's a flaccid penis you see what I'm saying the boner is amazing I have way more in common with my soft wrinkly disgusting flass of penis than I ever will with my erection my bone are strong confident got great posture I'm nervous insecure and Squishy ladies you can't tell a guy that come on can't tell a guy hey I never want to see you soft that's like me telling a girl hey I never want to see you without makeup my boner is my mascara that's all I have oh boy wish that wasn't true got to tell you this might be the best I've ever done um I do not go over all the time so this is nice uh yeah I think uh my problem with the ladies is I want you all to like me that's my problem you gals uh you're a tough nut to crack cuz you're all different that's the thing you like some girls like a nice guy some girls like jerks so how do you know what I do I do both I see an attractive lady I open the door for her and I say after you fatty mix it up cover your bases you know but you know and these are all just jokes about women I love the ladies I try to be a good feminist I do uh which is tough nowadays cuz some women are feminists and some women aren't so as a guy how do I know how to act you like some girls you open the door for them they're like wow a gentleman thank you very much other girls you open the door for them they're like what you think I can't open my own door I'm like who hey I'm just trying to bang you jez Louise how' we get here good Lord I used to work as a janitor that was a rough gig mopping floors cleaning bathrooms I worked at this Swanky Law Office in Midtown nobody looked me in the eye nobody talked to me I remember one day I was mopping the floor and a businessman slipped and he goes Jesus man if the floor is wet you got to put a sign down I'm like I'm mopping in front of you I am the sign you know the little guy on the sign doing this that's me but in 3D oh boy the worst part was that my boss chewed me out after he's like come on Mark you're embarrassing me out there I'm like you're embarrassed I went to college let me have this one you know then he'd say stuff to me like hey would you learn how to mop I don't know Fantasia who learns mopping you know uh hate the day job I hate it I've had so many office gigs I don't fit in at an office setting you got to be very PC very appropriate I'm not a PC guy I'm a comedian you know last day job I was talking to this guy at the front desk I was delivering the mail and I was like hey man what's the name of that new guy on the fifth floor the really tall black guy and this guy goes whoo I don't see color I was like really did you really just say that did they really just come out of your face so I looked this guy right in the eye and I was like hey man it's cool I'm black and he was like no you're not I'm like aha getting older is tough everything kind of starts falling apart when you get older you know about a year ago I got paranoid about losing my hair started taking Propecia could not get an erection you remember sir yeah right this girl I was dating at the time was like hey you got to get off those pills I'd rather have an erection than hair which is nice to hear but that only makes sense when you're dating somebody it doesn't work in the beginning like if I was a bald guy that hit on a bar like hey can I buy you a drink she's like I'm good I'm like H I have a boner yeah hair loss is scary man I don't know if women realize how much guys think about that you know I was telling my friend I'm like I'm worried my hair is going to thin my friend goes I know what you're going through buddy I'm going gray I was like well changing color is a lot different than losing something that'd be like if I said yeah I went to the beach the other day shark attack I lost my leg my friends like I feel you man tan line I don't get the whole homophobia thing that's a weird when any homophobes here I uh I did some sh shows in the South recently I was talking to this guy after the show I told him about a friend of mine who's gay this guy goes you have a gay friend I wouldn't even shake a gay man's hand I was like Jesus Christ why not he goes you know how many dicks are on that hand I was like well you shook my hand you okay with my dick cuz uh there's a lot of interaction between the two all right yeah wow that is terrible logic you know who else touches a lot of dicks women Yeah man they put them all over you're screwed can't touch anything now come on I don't know I think homophobia can actually be kind of dangerous you know friend of mine he's kind

damn it yeah yeah it's a lot of dating sites out there now I think guys like the dating sites because it's tough to approach a woman cold out of nowhere especially when you're doing this yeah it's tough it's a tough move so I feel like women should hit on men more hit on us ladies you can say whatever you want to a guy I had an older lady approach me once she goes ooh I'm gonna kidnap you I was like wow I could never say that to a woman I said that to a lady she calls the police I would be curious to know what a woman could say that would offend me like all right I'm gonna take you home drug you take advantage you and film it I'd be like all right well at least let me pay for the Uber all right I don't know I'm I'm just jealous of you gals you know you have options you have the freedom to say no like if a girl goes on a date with a guy and this guy takes out his Nazi memorabilia she's like I get the hell out of here if I go on date with a girl she takes out her Nazi memorabilia I'm

phone you know my dick's like an indie band you got to see it live they got to be in the room to really understand it but I was in a relationship for like 11 years uh yeah now I'm out there scared alone flaccid right yeah I learned all the the tricks of the trade again I learn everything the hard way you know it's tough yeah like I learned that uh girls they don't like when a guy says the word sex on a date it's like saying bomb at the airport the whole thing shuts down right yeah we all like sex it feels good we can't bring it up the only way to get the thing you want is to pretend like I don't want it that's weird Behavior what if job interviews were like that so Mark why do you want to work here who says I want to work here I'm just hanging out taking it easy yeah yeah I was on a date once I was like I'm just gonna go for it and I go hey you want to make out this girl goes uh grow up I was like okay anal that's older right yeah yeah I learned the hard way too the girls like when a guy has a plan ready for the day he's got something planned out which how did guys get stuck with that chore right I had a girl ask me out once we show up we meet she's like hey what are we doing I'm like I don't know what are we doing she's like you didn't play anything I'm like no did you she's like no I'm like well then you're just as worthless as me why do I have to figure it out I believe in equal rights can we work on this together and she was like well it's very manly when a guy plans a date no it's not just convenient for you how's that manly chopping wood is like wrestling a bear man there's nothing manly about Googling topless and bistros come on ladies you got the right to vote in 1920 let's use that on restaurants huh I don't know where to go because I have a dick I'm Zagat help me out what the hell manly come on I've noticed women only call things manly when they like it about a guy oh he pays for dinner he protects me and somebody like oh he wants to bang my friends going baldy so manly it's manly too where's the credit for that ah yeah tough to figure out what to do one time me and a girl we just we couldn't figure out anything to do we went people watching that's a very New York thing huh people watching should we call it what it really is we're just people judging isn't it you know I've never been bird watching me like ooh I wonder if that Sparrow knows he's gay yeah that's not a sparrow that's a swallow but hey it's got to be tough to date as a woman I can't even imagine what that's like dating dudes God that's got to be awful you get murdered could have a soul patch oh yeah oh God crazy yeah it's got to be tough but although women can say stuff men can never say you know yeah like uh one time I was eating dinner with a girl I was telling a story she cut me off mid-story she goes you're not liking a guy like a strong silent type I was like what could you imagine if a guy said that what do you look for in a woman silence I like a woman who's tough and shuts the hell up get kicked out of society I don't know maybe it's me maybe I'm screwed up sexually you know I caught my parents having sex when I was eight 21 and today yeah yeah oh the idea of your parents having sex is so horrifying isn't it you know that's why I'm surprised apparently use that as a threat okay wouldn't that be so effective like hey Timmy you better clean that room me and your mom are gonna go at it  all right how do you want that math test Billy I got a D I'll show you some D all right yeah it's tough out there I'm seeing somebody now but boy single life yeah that's that's the real deal you know people are so condescending to single people like oh you're single oh don't get lonely like well sure but how come we always assume loneliness is worse than a relationship I feel like loneliness allows you to manage definitely to get out of you get lonely call a friend go to a movie if you're in a bad relationship you're like well I guess I got a killer or him or him my ex she was tough my ex was like a real big feminist now I'm a feminist but she was like annoying yeah yeah she would always say stuff like men just should win by their looks it's all about her looks what about our achievements which is true men do do that but ladies you do it too we all judge women all right all right like one time she got me flirt another girl and she was like what does she look like that was the first question I was like whoa what about our achievements she's a human being goddammit when you're single though you miss love as I said love it's nice to have someone love you that's nice but that's the thing we all want the love but nobody wants to do the work that's what the love part yeah it's kind of like a dog walker we all have our dog be a pacemind do the stuff you don't want to do pick up the poop walk it would it be great to have a girlfriend Walker just some guy on the sidewalk with eight girlfriends on a leash like all right tell me about your day yeah get mad about a dream you had asked me something hypothetical about you gaining weight cry now cry now then you get your girlfriend back like did you cry took a while but she cried yeah oh yeah a lot of women hate that joke which is how you know it's real I don't know maybe I'm just uh I'm being bitter you know my last girlfriend dumped me said I wasn't manly enough for her not a manly guy that one hurt I know we're allowed to say stuff like that you know like like how come a woman can say something like yeah that guy was good with his hands he could fix stuff around the house and you're like all right cool but if a guy says hey I like a woman we can cook people go whoa whoa It's not the 50s well how come her job for me is okay my driver's not okay also who doesn't

checked out at one point she goes look I can tell you I don't like me just want to sleep with me I was like well yeah but that's your fault she was like screw you I'm more just a pretty face I'm like yeah but that's all you worked on your hair makeup outfit get a goddamn knock knock joke together I don't get these good looking people they spend 100 time on a look zero on their personality just assume that part's amazing why would you work on that too all right before it did everybody goes how do I look don't ever goes am I annoying isn't that more important you know like that's what you got to worry about like I know I'm not a hot guy before a date I'm writing jokes in my hand limericks anecdotes I'm bringing it baby I'm tap dancing out there yeah hey come on I'm working it flavor girls

Caitlyn Jenner she's kind of weird looking some girl goes hey she's beautiful and I was like well you kind of look like her and she was like  you so which one is it you know  yeah ex-girlfriend was Jewish big old Jew yeah yeah we did it for a while just found out my ex-girlfriend's getting breast implants that blew my mind I use the term breast implants I don't like the term fake breasts doesn't make sense to me because the breasts are real it's just the  inside that's fake the breasts are still real it's kind of like the Bible the book is real it's just the  inside it's big leather book boy the Bible what a buzz kill huh yeah yeah they don't like anything fun they hate gay they hate trans that's gonna be great when doing stuff so sexually Advanced I mean in the bible you know like I love having sex with my robot the guy's like all right you're good maybe I'll try it Jesus Christ I know some people get mad we make fun of their religion you know which I never got if you believe it just believe it was about what I say I believe in gravity and somebody's like hey gravity's not real I'll be like all right good luck out there religion just feels silly come on who needs God we got Google we're good go ahead he writes back just really falling off over the years you know like 60 years ago rock and roll is considered the devil's music now this Christian rock well what the hell happened there what if we wait long enough they just join in what's next 20 years from now hey Christian gay porn I can already see the first movie come here son kneel before me I don't know I don't mean to bash it I just don't think people really believe that's my theory I don't think you really buy it we were brought up with it's tradition I went to Catholic school you know but I don't think people really believe it really believe in the devil it's a red guy with horns pitchfork waiting for you you know he's the most evil thing ever we're too casual about it we got food named after him we've got deviled eggs a devil's food cake we have a hockey team called the New Jersey Devils you would never name a sports team after something actually real and evil never have like the Detroit Isis coming at you  guys hey Holocaust panini all right right out of the oven whoa slavery saucer yeah don't get the swirl get mixed the colors  that's actually real and Evil yeah it's the most evil thing ever we're too casual about it we say stuff like hey speak of the devil here's Greg which comparing Greg the most evil thing of all time willy-nilly out of the blue you would never have something real and evil and never like hey speaking of Jared Fogle here's Greg like what no hey kids no no I hate kids I don't know I think I'm just jealous of religious people must be nice must be comforting to really believe something you know that must be nice yeah I really tried religion I really tried I prayed nothing happened I talked to God nothing happened zero results zero how is that acceptable I feel like we let religion slide because it's free yes if you had to pay for religion once a month like Netflix you'd be like well this  isn't working  to try that agnostic Network after this because at least that's free but yeah you know sorry just throw my thoughts at you here folks I know weird you guys are nice some crowds don't take it as well I got called a douchebag at a show recently that's a fun word huh douchebag yeah because the insult is more popular than the actual product never seen one what is like a Ziploc I have no idea right I feel bad for the guy who invented the thing some guy in the 1800s I invented this thing for women's hygiene we're all like nice job man we're just going to use that to describe dudes and fedoras I did some research on it the douchebag actually bad for him and it's not good for you so apparently the guy invented it kind of a douche but that's the thing I'm getting older you know I gotta uh gotta get it together you know getting older getting older's tough everything kind of starts falling apart when you get older you know about a year ago I got paranoided by losing my hair started taking Propecia could not get an erection you remember sir yeah this girl I was dating at the time was like hey you got to get off those pills I'd rather have an erection than hair which is nice to hear but that only makes sense when you're dating somebody it doesn't work in the beginning like if I was a bald guy that hit on her at a bar like hey gonna buy you a drink she's like I'm good I'm like ah I have a boner hair loss is scary man I don't know if women realize how much guys think about that you know I was telling my friend I'm like I'm worried my hair is going to thin my friend goes I know what you're going through buddy I'm going gray I was like well changing color is a lot different than losing something that'd be like if I said yeah I went to the beach the other day shark attack I lost my leg my friends like I feel you man tan line yeah being an adult it's tough you can tell being an adult is hard just by the abbreviations we use you know when you're a teenager it's like LOL OMG BRB when you're adult you're like  I got a DUI I gotta go down the DMV the IRS is up my ass I got a UTI uh my IBS is kicking in I might have an STD you know some kids like TMI are like fu yeah everything kind of changes when you get older you know my brother had a kid that's crazy everyone wants to play with the baby touch the baby hug the baby I find babies fascinating because babies are the only thing that comes out of another person that strangers want to hold you ever think about that anything else comes out of a human being you're like wow this dinner party is over but a baby we're all about it it's weird we live in such a germaphobic culture you sneeze on a guy he wants to kill you but hey vagina monster Gucci Gucci goo very interesting something to think about you know there's some perks to getting older though I think older women are sexy yeah uh anybody here but through menopause might be a younger crowd um I'm very eager when it comes to this stuff you ladies really keep a lid on this  you know like like my aunt's gone through menopause right now she's bummed out she's depressed I thought that would be a good time menstruation's over years of discomfort over come on you graduated sisters time move that tampon string to the side  right why isn't that a party where's that Facebook invite huh hey Aunt Marie stop bleeding every month all right everybody in the pool  yeah yeah I'm sorry if it's too dark and I'm just being myself here folks people tell to be yourself your whole life that is the worst advice on the planet yourself sucks every time I myself been fired kicked in the balls dumped whatever

know and people tell to be yourself with the worst times too hey you got a hot date tonight Mark just be yourself all right you're sitting at dinner some girl's like so Mark what are you thinking about I'm like well just thinking you know you rarely see any female pedophiles uh which is probably for the best because they can make their own kids just being me um the worst times hey you got a job interview just be yourself all right you're in some office some guy's going so mark what's your worst quality well you know I uh I always start masturbating when I'm already late for something huh

hell very Bleak they're behind the times to say the least they hate Jews they hate gays they don't let women drive that one's not bad I mean it's rough rough over there holy moly I was over there with a friend of mine uh openly gay comedian very flamboyant guy we almost got like 10 fist fights just walk around town it's weird because the men over there hate gays but they also hold hands so it's a weird thing for your brain to compute when you see it you know it's like hey get out of here  come on Tom we can have both of those pick a thing yeah I got real bummed out over there I was over there too long man I got so homesick that why not I Googled the bald eagle yeah true story yeah fun fact the most common way the bald eagle dies gets hit by a train weird right swoops down the dead carcass on the train track it's so full it can't fly away and a train hits it what's more American than that we've all been there huh you go to a buffet eat too much you're like ah just  kill me yeah they put all the performers up in this little condo in the middle of the desert felt so unsafe so nervous I had no lock on my door all I was a chain lock who feels safe with a chain line I hate the chain lock I'm gonna get the lodge behind a chain lock like yeah I want to keep criminals out but I also want to tease them a couple inches entice them a bit you know the chain lock seemed more like a prank than

he's good being gay 60 years ago and I was like hey Mom I'm gay she's like good for you you're like hey Mom I'm homophobe but she's like don't tell anybody it's all flipped it makes you wonder what are the kids gonna say now on the playground Middle School when I was get gay was an M1 insult what are these kids gonna say you know it's all different now now it's gonna be like look at bill whoo he runs like I don't believe in same-sex marriage oh man how about Bob he's never blown a guy what a   sometimes I wish I was gay you know I I got fired for my last job for sexual harassment I told a woman she had nice legs they fired me which pissed me off because my gay friends are working away with murder they're like hey Shelly how are you Hong Kong what why is that okay they're like well she's not attracted to women I was like so what I'm not attracted to kids I can't go to a playground hey Timmy yeah thank you I don't get stuff like that you know like you're a woman would you rather be complimented by a group that's into you I don't care if a lesbian compliments me nothing gets lesbian but that didn't help me out yeah I have a lesbian's like hey Mark like a haircut I'm like I know you're the same one doesn't help me at all yeah that's when I was at the Gay Pride Parade you know I went with a friend know this guy 12 years I had no idea was gay blew my mind he decided to come out of the closet at the parade I had no idea was gay and when your friend comes out of the closet the first thing you think is holy hell how many gay jokes have I made around this guy right it's been 12 years you know it's a lot of jokes and I had a guy in the crowd get mad he goes what do you make gay jokes what do you hate gays I was like no you idiot I just make fun of who's not around I'm not prejudiced I'm a coward don't we all do that when you wear the friends Billy make fun of Jeff with your friend Jeffy make one a bill I don't hate them they just weren't there that's all people love Coney Island on that what do you make fun of black people are you racist no I just didn't see any okay I wish I didn't see you yeah brutal times we're living I feel like we're so quick to call everybody racist homophobic misogynist you know that word race we throw that around willy-nilly I was at a party once I was like that last name that's Korean right some guy goes it's Chinese you're racist I was like well I just got it wrong I don't hate them we don't do that with other stuff what are those tulips they're lilacs you bought and the son of a  all right got my eye on you I love flowers I have some yeah right you can just say a race now and people get upset there's no context anymore I was at a show Once telling a story I was like yeah a friend of mine black guy someone actually yelled out hey why is he FB black well mostly his  parents pretty sure it's hereditary yeah I don't get why we're so sensitive about certain groups and cultures you know like you can't make generalizations anymore that's out you know but certain groups have different qualities different traits that's just how we are that's the fun part you know I made a hacky joke once about Mexicans and Landscaping this guy in the back goes hey not all of them you're generalizing buddy not all of them all right fair enough but how come they never do that on a positive generalization and I go hey Mexicans are very resilient people number goes hey not all of them you're generalizing buddy you can do it with dogs no one gets mad about that you know Hey Chihuahuas shed less than golden retrievers I guess that's true but if you say Italians punch more women than Asians everybody's like oh why are you mad at me I'm just going off Google I didn't do it what did I do yeah seems like the only group you can make fun of now openly in public is children that's it you can say whatever the hell you want about kids you're like oh I hate kids don't bring your kids around no kids allowed I've killed a few yeah hate kids yeah say whatever you want about imagine a show called Jews to the darndest things right I would never fly it'd be a great show though wouldn't it how you doing  we are chosen a great show yeah I guess you're allowed to make fun of kids because we all were kids at one point that makes a little easier and I can't be like hey screw you I was Mexican for 18 years all right yeah get out of my hair and I believe in equality and all that stuff I just make jokes what happened to jokes you know I believe women should be paid the same as men I do I used to work at this office job one day I walked in this woman was crying her eyes out she's like I saw the paychecks I want to be treated like a man I was like well you want to be paid like a man you don't be treated like a man we don't treat each other well if you're true like a man some guy would walk in and see you crying be like hey suck it up  what are you doing oh my God Jesus Christ Rachel's a  Rachel's a  I feel like a man would even say that we Mayhem Shelley how are you vagina flick that's what dudes are doing what are you nuts we'd have to get rid of sexual harassment laws open the door for titty twisters credit card swipe hand grenade Betty coming at you come on ladies you guys want to move furniture and kill spiders get out of here right and why would you I don't either we're very hung up on treating all the groups the same but the differences of the fun part we should embrace that you know we do that with black people white people all the time you hear that a lot you know you should always treat black people might feel the same no you shouldn't we should have the same rights we shouldn't always be treated the same they'll be insensitive we all have different  going on like if I see a black guy I love jewelry on his hat match his shoes I'm like hey cool guy if I see a white guy like jewelry on his hat match issues I'm like hey he's gay differences differences if I'm dry around my white friend and we get pulled over I'm like here's my insurance if I drive around my black friend we get pulled over I'm like uh a little talking thank you true all right if I see a white guy call a black guy the n-word I'm like well it's gonna get ugly if a black guy calls me the n-word I'm over the goddamn Moon not a great feeling come on  yeah it bums me out like we're at a time now where you just mention a race and people get angry it's like well why did your brain go to a bad place it's never a good place like I was at a show Once I was telling a joke I was like yeah Jew a black guy and a Mexican walk in a bar this guy goes hey hey I was like screw you look at that diversity these guys are hanging out it's a hell of a bar beautiful thing never the good everybody's so offended why is everybody so offended offended what is that being offended that's the adult version saying I'm telling you gotta be very PC now those PC words I'm all about progress but why does adding syllables toward make it less offensive you know used to be stupid and that was learned disabled you should be  now it's mentally gay or whatever can't keep up with the PC you know it's all just a gesture none of it means anything like some PC I like like Native American that's good he's not from India why we're calling him Indian Native American great I'll say that but like African-American I feel weird saying I'll be African-American friends I have black friends so many Caucasian friends I have relatives none of it adds up we're all the African Canadians why don't we say that black people born can every day we don't know what the hell we're saying anymore but like Idris elba's an amazing African-American actor well he's British what the hell are we doing it's just white people we're nervous we don't know what to say we're scared we don't want to get fired we don't offend you could Corner a white guy on the sidewalk now with a microphone a video camera like what color is Ray Charles he'd be like uh he's blind but what's his ethnicity piano player what color is the skin I got kids man leave me alone we're terrified it's coming to my home now I'm watching Discovery Channel like hey it's a great white shark mediocre white we're not all great I'm sorry oh my God it's bananas it's out of control I just don't get it why are we so obsessed with skin color why is skin the one part of the body you can't judge by color they go hey yellow teeth gross redhead gross everything's judged by color he's a black belt he's Blue Collar he's Red State he's got pink guy all color why is skin so important I think it's because you can't change skin color you know you can change your hair color trip to CVS hey your girlfriend comes on Blonde one day you're like hey look at that your girlfriend comes on black you're like what the hell happened he can even change genders now that's cool get surgery take pills Caitlyn Jenner what a hero what was that chick who told me she was black Rachel dolezal who are like yeah nice try  come on we all want to be black in line Whitey right can't just go black in your 30s skip all the hard stuff too convenient right I can't just step over oppression and be like all right I'll take that bigger dick yeah all right you gotta take the good with the bad you know I don't know I'm still good how do you hate a whole group how do you hate a whole group I don't get that I hate specifics about people you know like people drink Rockstar or believe in ghosts and say it is what it is that's what I hate yeah but racism is alive and well man I was just down in uh Knoxville Tennessee you guys ever been there what a  holy hell they are 30 years behind over there you ever go to a town so small they're still racist towards certain white people you know they're like hey watch out over there that's what a dirty Irish live I was like Jesus Christ you guys haven't made it to black people yet my God you're far behind I live in New York we're past Arabs let's go pick it up come on ah yeah and I'm from the south too so I've Seen It All South is a weird reputation we're known for being racist and hospitable it's a weird combo huh it's like every white guy sitting around on the south going oh crap a couple of black guys moved in the neighborhood I gotta make a pound cake yeah but yeah very risky to make jokes now very risky to be right being racist now very risky you lose your job you get ostracized from society you make headlines that's why if anyone's ever raised this around you now you know they trust you it's kind of this weird Bittersweet moment you know you're on a smoke break with somebody he's like oh man I can't stand Mexicans you're like holy hell you're full of hate but I didn't know we were so close Christ I feel like racism and smoke are a lot alike you know like in the 50s everybody did it now we know it's bad we're trying to cut back but some people just can't quit we should treat racists the way we treat smokers now you're at your day job some guy's about to tell a racist joke you're like hey take that  outside huh just a bunch of guys out in the cold huh goddamn Jews  if I don't take those racist breaks I get cranky and I go to restaurants how you folks doing you want the racist section or non-racist well we've had a few drinks better go races all right well it's your funeral the kitchen is heavily

somehow I'll tell you those pedophiles are a creepy Bunch creepy bunch of guys creepy is a fun word though isn't it because it's a word that's changed with age to a kid and to an adult they me told different things like to a kid creepy is like spooky like a cemetery is creepy to an adult creepy is like a guy on a bus who Winks at you while eating a banana it's totally changed I'm actually the creepy guy at my office I uh I work as a janitor during the day uh I tell people I'm a maintenance man but there mobing that's moing hate my job it's the worst job I've ever had everybody looks down

told um there's a gay guy in my work and I I'm all for gay marriage I love gay marriage cuz it's the only big issue you can be honest about and still look like a good person let me explain like if somebody says hey man how do you feel about that earthquake in Haiti I don't care it doesn't affect me what a dick but if somebody says hey man how do you feel about gays getting married I don't care doesn't affect me you got the right attitude very Progressive I have a a good friend that he he's got to be gay like I'm positive he's gay I'm 100% positive he's gay but he won't admit it you know I don't care that he's gay but just tell me we're friends the most I can get out of him is he'll say well I experimented in college and I'm like yeah but you went to college online you ever done College on online it's like 20 minutes a month you know so really you are gay and you experimented with college I think that's what really happened there I love the gays one of my friends just moved up here and uh he's kind of new he's kind of behind the times and every time he talks about a gay person he says this he goes uh yeah you know my friend Jeff he's gay good guy though do that every time he's gay good guy though which is weird cuz gays aren't even known for being bad people you know like I can see if you're like oh you know my friend Jeff he's a pedophile good guy though that makes sense but that's not even a stereotype that gays are bad you know no one's ever like hey man hi your wallet there's gays around religious people don't like the gays that's a thing H I'm not religious I'm not religious at all although I do find religion funny like it's interesting to me that in the ' 50s rock and roll is considered the the devil's music now this Christian rock what the hell happened there I guess Christians go with that old motto if you can't beat them ruin it I think my favorite religion has got to be Scientology any Scientologist here all right let's make fun of them I love Scientology because it's the only religion out there that you could make fun of in public and everybody's on board you know religion touch a touchy subject you can never do that with any other group you know you can never be like uh uh like if you're like hey man I hate the Muslims well you're a racist well I hate the Jews well you're an anti-semite well I hate Scientologist what are you doing later any Jews here all right confident Jews I like that I don't know why you put your dukes up that's weird all right uh he must be from Brooklyn I love a good Jew I love Jews I like Jews cuz you guys have your own Persona your own personality you know so much so you can actually use the word Jew as an adjective you know you be like oh yeah Jeff's got curly hair very nervous kind of jewy but you could never do that with any other religion you know you can never be like oh yeah Bob you won't let his wife Drive kind of Muzzy makes her cover her face big old muz that guy a buddy of mine's a real big sports fan uh he was bummed out the other day because his uh favorite baseball player is on steroids and I was like what do you care and he goes hey how would you feel if your favorite porn star was on Viagra and I was like well honestly I think it's strange you think my favorite porn stars are men that's a little weird uh also I don't care if porn stars on Viagra I don't care if they're on steroids that's great you know I'm not watching porn for the ethics you know yeah I love I love the internet that's my religion I feel like if I if I have a religion it's the internet I'm on it all day I give it money that's my religion that's why I love my neighborhood because everyone around me has Wi-Fi restaurants coffee shops I saw a di bar with Wi-Fi the other day the only place I've never seen with Wi-Fi is a church and I think that makes sense cuz no church want compete with invisible power that actually works hey all right got some atheists that's fun race is a touchy sub H let's talk about that I got in trouble at a comedy show recently uh because I used a racial slur but I didn't even know it was a slur I had no idea but in my defense can we all agree that the gentlest of the racial slurs has got to be China men I mean come on he's from China he's a man not so bad to me the names of Chinese restaurants actually sound a lot more like racial slurs let's try some you know who can't drive those freaking Panda Kings they cannot drive at all and listen to this one of those golden noodles just moved my apartment building oh yeah moved in right next door to me they one big happy family it's all right I can do that joke I'm friends with an Asian n friends with an Asian good guy though race is such a ridiculous thing to get mad about you know it's it's such a touchy thing everybody gets so cringy about race like uh I think sometimes calling someone racist can in fact be more racist I'll give you an example I was at a restaurant recently guy came in to get a takeout order they screwed up his order like five times eventually the guy just snaps and he goes Jesus what is this place run by monkeys and the manager goes excuse me sir that is racist uh now it  is I was at a party recently and this guy comes up me out of the blue and he goes hey have you ever dated a Spanish girl and I was like uh I don't think so and he goes you don't have any Spanish friends do you I was like no I don't I don't have any white friends either you want to rub it in like why do we always jump right to racism you know it's always like you don't to be black friends you must hate black people no I'm just unpleasant to be around I kill for some black friends I kill for some white friends I'm very lonely take it easy Spanish man good Lord I am I am seeing a lady right now uh it's not goinging too well I don't know why that turned you on uh you want to join I don't know um all right uh wait for an answer there I got nothing yeah it's not going too well uh got something from the girlfriend last night I haven't got in years got the old blue balls nothing thought about that hate the blue balls the worst part about it she like what is that what is blue balls I don't get it what

man in bed by giving him compliments I was like all right it's going to be great next time we have sex she's going to be complimenting me which she did but the compliments weren't sexy so it's just awkward I'll give you an example we're going at it and I flip her over and she goes good  idea then I did something else she goes nicely done and I'll tell you getting compliments in bed sounded good in theory but you never want to be in a sexual situation with a woman have say not too shabby little adult creepy thanks a lot guys have more
Mark Normand,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkl03WJPxKc,"- We were, like,
face-to-face right here, and she was like,
""Yeah, this is,"" you know, blah, blah, blah,
and I was like, ""Oh, it's really pretty,"" and then she looks me
right in the eye, and I swear to God she says,
""I want you to come in my face.""    ♪   - Hello, everybody. Welcome to
""This Is Not Happening."" I'm your host, Ari Shaffir, and tonight
it's all stories about romance.  All right,
ladies and gentlemen, he's got an amazing podcast
in iTunes called ""Tuesdays with Stories.""  Please give it up for
 Mr. Mark Normand, everybody.  - So here we go,
story time. I--I decided I wanted to go
to film school in New York City, so I moved there and moved
to Crown Heights, Brooklyn, with 400 bucks in my pocket. It was a horrible year. I got mugged three times
in a year, my landlord died of AIDS, and the first day
I got my apartment, there was a pigeon in there. Yeah, probably should have
closed with the AIDS, but yeah. So if you don't know
Crown Heights, it's this crazy neighborhood
way out in Brooklyn. It's got a highway dividing it. It's all Hasidic Jew
on this side, all Caribbean black
on this side, so obviously,
I moved into the black side. Yeah. There were two apartments
available, but I'm not gonna live
with Hasidic people. I mean, come on. What's going on there? I don't want--
how many landlords do you want? You know what I mean?
Like, Jesus Christ, you know. And nothing against Jews.
I love Jews. My ex-girlfriend's Jewish;
I love Ari, you know, show business,
ahh, but, you know, I would come home drunk a lot
at, like, 5:00 in the morning, and these Jews
would pull up in their minivan, and they'd slide the door open,
like, ""You're on the wrong side.
Get in."" And I was like,
""I'm not Jewish."" And they would just
peel right off. Yeah,
they were a tough bunch. They're very loyal. So I lived in this apartment,
the worst apartment of all time. Periodically,
the hot water would go out, the electricity would go out,
and the heat would go out. It was the dead of winter. So I'm going to film school
every day. It's, like, an hour commute
back to Manhattan every day from my apartment,
and I wake up one Monday to go to school--
no hot water. I was like, ""Eh,
I didn't shower all weekend, ""but I can go one more day. It's cold out,""
you know? I go to school. Tuesday I wake up,
no hot water. ""Eh, I can't take a shower
in cold weather with cold water. I'll just go to school."" Wednesday rolls around,
no hot water. ""Ah, I'll be all right."" Now I'm the smelly guy
at school, you know? I'm the--it was brutal.
I was that guy, you know. So I'm kind of
getting desperate. Thursday comes, zero,
no hot water, nothing, no heat. It's like, ""Ahh,"" but I'm late,
so I just go to school. Finally, Friday,
I get desperate. I wake up early. I'm like,
""I'm putting water in a pot, ""I'm gonna boil it, and I'm
gonna just take a whore bath right in the kitchen,""
you know? Yeah. So the heat's out,
the electricity is out, and the hot water is out,
so I just go, ""Ah, God damn it."" So I'm in the kitchen
in the dark just pouring water into a pot. I start boiling it, you know,
in the dark, and I just kind of start bathing
myself, and it felt amazing. I was so gross, and the lights
click on just then, and the pot had been used
by my roommate to cook Stove Top Stuffing in
the night before. So now I'm--not only
do I have terrible B.O. I'm covered in 11 herbs
and spices, you know? I got--I got all these
little things on me, little green things,
and garlic here. It was a mess,
so now I'm desperate. I run to the train.
I have no time to clean up. I'm already late.
So I run to the train. And I get on the train.
It's packed out. I'm the only white guy
on the train, and all these black guys
are sniffing me, you know, like,
""What is that? ""Is this hobo Thanksgiving?
What's going on here?"" So I'm like, ""I don't know.
Somebody probably farted. It is November.
I don't know."" Yeah, so I get to school,
and now I'm desperate. I'm going around
asking everybody if I can shower at their place,
you know, teachers, students, whatever. I'm just freaking out. Everybody says no.
I'm, like, a weirdo. People are looking at me funny. And eventually,
I get to Mrs. Fritz. Now, I'll paint the picture
of Mrs. Fritz. She was the--
the horror makeup lady. She, like,
did all that horror shit, you know, and she was
a kooky gal, you know. She had, like, a beehive hairdo,
Lisa Loeb glasses. She would have, like,
watermelons on her dress, and then watermelon earrings. You know, she was a full-class
kook, you know, like, half art teacher, half hipster,
all nutjob, you know? She was fun. But she was attractive
in her own right. She was probably 40,
41 years old, nice lady, and I was like,
""Hey, Mrs. Fritz, ""you're gonna kill me,
but just feel free to say no. Can I shower at your place?"" And she goes, ""Yeah, sure.
What do I care?"" And meanwhile,
this is a 41-year-old woman. You know, she's a teacher.
People give her apples. You know, like,
I'm a 21-year-old idiot. I've got, like, a propeller hat
and a big lollipop. I was nothing,
you know. So I was like,
""Oh, my God. Thank you so much.
I'm so excited."" And I know people are thinking,
like, ""Mark, your hot water's out
for a week. ""You get no electricity. Why didn't you just tell
your landlord?"" Well, it's a little awkward
complaining to your landlord about hot water
when he has AIDS. Yeah, it's a tough one.
What am I gonna say? ""I got not hot water."" ""Well,
I don't have an T-cells."" ""Cool, all right, yeah, got it. Yeah,"" so, you know,
and this was-- he wasn't, like, Magic Johnson. He was, like,
fuckin' ""Dallas Buyers Club."" He was, uh, it was a bad. I'm talking ""Rent,""
""Philadelphia,"" full-blown, baby, yeah,
so...nice guy, sweet kid. So I'm all excited. ""I'm gonna go to
Mrs. Fritz's house. I'm gonna take a real shower."" I hit the buzzer.
She buzzes me in. I go up to her place,
amazing apartment, unbelievable. She's was like a real adult. She had pictures in a frame
and curtains. It was wild,
you know. Every light bulb worked,
no stains, crazy, real adult. And I go into her kitchen,
giant table laid out, you know, all these place mats,
like, wine glass, regular glass, two plates,
forks, knives, the whole thing. It was crazy; she was having
a dinner party at 8:00. So she was like,
""Hey, you can shower, but you've got to get in,
get out,"" you know. I was like, ""No problem.""
It was, like, 6:30. I was like,
""I'll be out of here by 8:00. You've got a dinner party.
No problem."" So I was like,
""All right, here we go. Let's get in that shower."" She goes, ""Well,
have a glass of wine first."" I was like,
""Eh, all right, you know, I'll have a glass of wine."" Then I had another one
and another one, and we're talking about life
and love and the arts, you know, and I--you know,
all this stuff, and I just had
got out of college, so I had a couple tricks
up my anal, you know. I was ready to go,
you know, and she... just talking about everything. We're laughing.
We're having a great time. And this is, like, a--
this is, like, a real woman here,
you know? Like, I'm--I'm a 21-year-old
drunk from New Orleans. The only people
I've hooked up with are, like, bar skanks and cousins,
you know, nothing crazy,
you know? So...so I'm intimidated by her. She's, like,
successful and smart and clever and interesting and all that;
I was blown away. And so we're drinking,
and we're having a great time, and she goes, ""You know,
I'm making some paella here."" She had, like, eight pots going,
all this food. And I'm like, ""Well, like,
I've got to skedaddle ""here, sister;
I can't be eating. You've got dinner party
coming over, you know."" She was like, ""Don't worry about
it; you've got plenty of time. It's, like, 7:00.""
I was like, ""All right."" So I had the paella; it's
amazing, unbelievable, so good. Everything's great.
We're laughing. And she pours another glass
of wine. And I was like,
""Look, it's 7:30. I've got to get in the shower."" And she goes, ""All right,
all right, all right,"" and she had everything
in there, you know, like, soap,
and so then I... so...unbelievable,
real adult. So I'm like, ""Oh, wow,
this is great, all right."" So I remember, you know,
laughing. She hands me a towel.
We're having a great time. She's so nice. And I remember taking a shower, being in her bathroom
just like... ""Am I gonna--
am I gonna fuck Ms. Fritz? ""No, no, come on.
She's a 58-year-old woman. ""What, are you crazy?
Get out of here. She's got a dinner party
on the way over."" So I was like, ""All right,
all right, all right, come on."" So I get out of the shower.
I dry off real quick. It's, like, 7:48 now.
I'm freaking out. So I get out of the shower;
I'm like, ""All right, that was great.""
I put my new clothes on. ""I'll get out of your hair.
This was a great time."" She goes, ""Well,
have one more glass of wine."" And I'm like,
""You know, Mrs. Fritz, ""you've got people coming over. This is, uh,
you've got the dinner party."" And she goes,
""Ahh, it's fine."" So she has another glass
of wine poured, and she goes, ""Let me give you the tour
of the house before you go."" It's like, ""All right, eh.""  Yeah, you guys know. I didn't know what ""tour"" meant. So I was like, ""All right, sure,
I'll take a tour, yeah."" I'm holding my glass of wine. She was like, ""Oh, this chair ""has been in my family
for a million years. This lamp is from
the Byzantine era,"" whatever, you know, all this shit,
and she's like, ""This painting has been
in my family for years. Come--get on the couch.
Step on the couch."" So we're standing on her couch
looking at this painting, and, you know, I was like,
""Oh, this is nice."" She was like, ""Yeah,
it's Rembrandt's gay period,"" or whatever, and...
staring at this thing, and we were, like,
face-to-face right here, and she was like,
""Yeah, this is,"" you know, blah, blah, blah,
and I was like, ""Oh, it's really pretty,"" and then she looks me
right in the eye, and I swear to God she says,
""I want you to come in my face."" True story.
True story. Unbelievable, so I go,
""Well, I think I can do that.""  And so we just start going at it
on the floor. We're making out like crazy.
We're rolling around. We knock over lamps.
The cat's hissing. 
It was just hot. It was wild!
Crazy! Teacher! Student!
Paella! What a night! So we're going at it
like animals. I pick her old ass up, I throw her on the bed,
the whole thing. Oh, my God.
It was wild. And she pulls some cord; all
the lights go out in the house. Something happened,
so now we're rolling around in the dark just going at it. ""Ahh,"" crazy, you know, this is a 68-year-old woman
I'm banging here. This is wild,
so it was just hot and heavy and great in every way
and all this. I can feel her earrings
dangling around me. It was unreal. So we're going at it.
We're both naked. ""Ahh,"" you know,
and I remember at one point, we're probably 45 minutes
into this, we're going at it, and I was in
the doggy-style position, and I remember vividly thinking, ""Where the hell's
that dinner party?""  Ahh, people cancel.
Who cares? Ahh, let's get back to it. So we're going at it,
blah, blah, blah. Eventually,
we got at it for a while. Then we pass out;
we're both wine drunk. You know, we've had probably
nine glasses of wine here. So we're, you know,
we pass out. I wake up the next morning.
The sun is beaming in. The whole apartment's lit up. I've got a crazy wine hangover. And I was like, ""Oh, my God. What the hell happened
last night?"" That was wild.
Oh, man."" I look down; she's kind of
nuzzled right here. And I go to get up. I look at the bed-- covered in blood head to toe.  I mean,
this was tons. It was like a murder scene. She must have lost tons of iron.
This is wild. I mean,
I didn't know what to do, and, you know, I thought,
you know, at that age,
isn't that shit over? I had no idea, you know, and she
was so nonchalant about it. She was like, ""Oh, we
should have put a towel down."" What are you--
that was a fucking tarp. That's insane. So I was like, ""Oh, my God."" Just the irony here. I'm coming from the cleanest
I've ever been in weeks. Now I'm covered in uterine
lining here, all right? It was unbelievable.
I've got ovaries on my face. I looked like
a fucking Apache here. I was, like, fucking war paint.  Oh, my God.
It was crazy. But I was like,
oh, wow, all right, well, I guess
this is New York City, yeah, yeah, so... so I had--
you know, I was still in school. I had school on Saturday
back then. So I was like,
""I've got to get up. I've got to go.
What, are you crazy?"" And so I, you know,
just didn't have time to shower. I just put my clothes on, and I remember my underwear
was so gross, I just put it in my pocket. I just put my jeans on,
yeah, and put them there,
jeans on, shirt on. I just ran out the door, and she
goes, ""Hey, hey, wait a minute. ""Before you go, remember,
I'm a fucking teacher. ""You're a student.
Don't tell anybody, you weirdo. We could get in trouble.""
I'm like, ""Of course."" She's like, ""I'm serious.
This is real stuff here."" I'm like,
""Of course, of course."" So I run down to the train,
and I get on the train, and I go to school, and I immediately gather
every male at the school, every single one, you know,
student, teacher, janitor, whatever you are. I had the goddamn mayor
in there. Yeah, so I gather all of them
into the equipment room. Everybody's hanging
from the rafters. People are sitting on the floor. Everybody's like,
""What's going on, Norman? What's the big news?
What's the word?"" I go,
""You're not gonna believe this. I banged Mrs. Fritz."" And they all go, ""Oh, shut up. ""Get out of here.
She's, you know, 71. ""What, are you crazy? You're a liar."" And I go,
""You don't believe me, huh?"" I pull out the tighty whities. Yeah, so they were like,
""Oh, my God."" Everybody's hitting each other,
going crazy, unbelievable. It was like that--you know
when you have sex with a Greek, and you put the sheet out
on the window? That was it. That's--
look--Google that. So yeah.
Oh, it was great. It was like ""Sixteen Candles,""
but, you know, with, like,
a miscarriage in there. Yeah, it was unbelievable. So Monday comes around. They--they fire Ms. Fritz. Yeah,
but they never told her why, which is why I did this show.  It's cool.
We're Facebook friends. All right, thank you.
Thanks a lot.    ♪ "
Dave Chappelle,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRBaZVILUq0,it is great no for real Mel Gibson told me so you gotta go I never I've never met no kids huh he is no Mel Gibson is an incredible filmmaker and he's the only guy that beat the American Media machine it's a very difficult fight I've tried it and I lost oh no they won't they'll whoop you good you can't even Buck the system just a little bit look at Britney Britney Spears just wanted to have a couple babies look what they did to that girl awful man she had to shave her head just take the heat off her for me oh that  some people know how to beat it the politicians they can beat that because they get caught remember Gavin Newsom he's a man same friend right so he gets caught his campaign manager's wife they were like doing blow and all that it's pretty cool that's I mean I like getting news no that's some that was that's up you know what I mean it's just campaign man his whole job would be like this guy right here is a hell of a guy this one was pretty dirty though right so but he got away with it he's still like Teflon politician and you know what he did uh uh check himself into rehab that's the move in America I don't know what it's like in Britain but in America it's secret celebrity system rehab is base for regular people that's like you got to go there get better and but in the media style like yourself the San Francisco mirror Gavin Newsom basement  60 days I got 60 days and I want to hear   I rehab when they media got me and they hit me with the crackhead rumor that was up and I'm a skinny black dude I can't defend myself you know people just believe that it's very hard to defend yourself when I mean  who else got in trouble look at everybody Elliot Spitzer I actually like Elliot Spencer too I got a lot to say about that I'm not I should just come on man can't anybody am I the only one that can can you see the code charades you see the codes you see the codes right it's always about something do you understand what I'm saying do you actually understand what I'm saying it's not really expensive though it's a dirty ass system everybody gets in trouble but not for the same kind of reasons is can't explain it it's a very big idea and I don't know how to distill it without sound like a crazy conspiracy nut but it's not a conspiracy it's an actual fact he ever read this you ever read this thing about uh uh Lincoln and Kennedy somewhere on the internet you'll find it it's a list of similarities between like you know what I mean like like Abraham's Lincoln's secretary's last name is Kennedy Kennedy's secretary's last name was Lincoln I used to be Usher at Forest theater where Lincoln got you when I was in high school I had nothing to do with the murder I uh but I just pay attention to these types of things you know what I mean like the way they'd be trying to roll Barack over like he's Martin Luther King that's a complete meteor phenomenon I didn't draw that line Martin Luther King was not an elected official he wasn't he was a chosen official but he was not an elected official that's the difference someone sees a young preacher this charismatic they say you know what this guy could actually lead our movement and at first they asked me he said I don't want to do it they said why don't you want to do it because I'm 22 I'm getting I'm having fun but then eventually he's going to understand like this movement is bigger than him and and yet and yet may not have been the same movement without just that one individual now okay here comes Brian Barack runs and uh it was just that happens you know what I mean can't explain it yes I can Barack runs Barack runs against John McCain right uh barack's campaign song with Stevie Wonder's Signed Sealed Delivered I'm Yours right Stevie Wonder sponsors a bill for the Martin Luther King holiday John McCain is from the only state that refused to Martin Luther King holiday State of Arizona anyway the point is it's the same for all these people Elliot Spitzer how could he how could he go to a call girl after he was busting prostitution rings in New York I'll tell you how cause he was the attorney general he's an attorney general and someone puts a docket on your desk he can't be like I can't bust these people I buy he just has to go and plus keep the case that's his job he wins cases of course he's gonna have political aspirations because he was good at what he did and then nice remember Nas went crazy on the radio and he said Hot 97 is taking money to play up these records and everyone was like nah this is insane and Elliot Spitz was like I'm gonna look into that and Elliott Smith went in there and he was like hey these guys are taking Payola and they ended the practice the age-old practice of Paola in radio and then years later he's gonna get busted at the May file Hotel in Washington DC Miami let me tell you something I'm from DC you know Mayflower Hotel that's where Marion Barry was smoking crack while he was  a girl that wasn't supposed to be about the point is this getting caught with a call girl at the Mayflower Hotel is like getting called a cheeseburger at McDonald's make a dance that is where you're supposed to do those kinds of things  and then the girl comes out with a MySpace page and she's like oh the reason I'm sucking all these sticks is because a career I'm a musician I said a magician she said musician but I heard magician ladies and gentlemen for my next trick I'm going to suck a record contract out of an attorney general's dick same label as knots  you know what's so crazy about that which brings you back to the whole thing I've seen in the first place is that Elliot Spencer was going to get prosecuted under the man act and that says it all you know the man act the man Act the man Act Sherrod he don't know the man act you better know in your line of work you need to know these things the man Act is the law that says it's illegal to take it's illegal to take a girl across state lines for the purposes of debauchery the man Act was written to get one man and that man was Jack  Johnson the first black heavyweight champion of the world he used to beat the out of white men and leave the arena with white women in the 20s it was amazing he the whole Matrix up when Jack Johnson won the World Championship he chased the white Champion back then white Champions would be like I don't fight black people it's beneath me but really they were scared to death Jack Johnson was huge and you've seen them old tapes in them boxes them Jack Johnson moves like a modern person you know these if I had a time machine I could be the heavyweight champion yeah this point is fist at him I beat the out of these guys it was amazing I mean if you're watching these Jack Johnson because back then you know they won the same fight regulations he would whoop their ass for hours this is before cable television all that it was it was amazing and then he would leave the arena then he would openly have sex with white women all the time now you think he would get persecuted for that but they never touched him because the heavyweight champion in the world is the most prestigious title in sports period you know who suffered for that than white women want Killers no one killed herself I mean they ostracized these women like you wouldn't believe just cut them off from everything they knew and loved for  around with Jack Johnson and then they couldn't stop Jack Johnson the headline of people say Jack Johnson is it they chase this thing around they've made the man ax he had to flee the country he was living in Exile couldn't fight anymore but Muhammad Ali saw Jack Johnson's story on Broadway he said that is my story if you change white women to Islam he said that is my story right Jack Johnson just got pardoned in 2005. do you know who sponsored that bill John McCain cleaning up from that Martin Luther King said I'm telling you it's all connected it's a very flimsy system of pseudo or false morality yeah is anybody in here gay get her let's get it I'm totally joking it's New York are you gay for real yeah okay so you know the gay marriage is illegal right why you think that that's illegal people suck I don't know I don't have a good answer to that do you even care about marriage yeah yeah to a girl or guy just checking  why do you think it's illegal people are scared of change do you think so who said morality you think so I don't know who's morality who said big business she knows what's going on huh yeah and this and it's all good and well you see here's the thing no matter what your morality is it's still a secular society so even if gay marriages against my own personal beliefs I can't necessarily believe a government that would say we don't want to do that for moral purposes not why you bomb in Iraq like that or saying the have games or something like that I mean if you came to hit me with all this dubious hands to morality they say morality because that's what their constituents need to hear and because they think that's what their constituents want to hear but honestly Bill Clinton said 90 of the that people talk about has nothing to do with what the actual job of the president is about you think president would be sitting around what time is it 10 o'clock oh we got that game meeting hey guys what are we gonna do about that man I don't give a about I know who actually is gonna give a big business and I have a whole beliefs this month that you just don't want to know I'll tell you part of it all right uh it's a tiered it's a tear listen marriage laws are up in America I think that the government should have that much say in actually how people devise a marriage because of marriage right devoid of any kind of religious belief or emotion like love is a business contract Perry and simple and tons of people in Washington or legislative bodies even guys like Elliot Spencer that have wives with prostitutes living Loveless marriages and they have these shits arranged because they're in such a high social Stratosphere that they have to keep up with certain appearance so why are they imprisoned by their own marriage is this form of economic slavery and if you look at the way this happens corporations were made legal in the United States by the 14th Amendment right or 15th Amendment which freed the slaves and none of those writers people said we want the same rights as those  as collective individuals right and if you're a collective individual and two Collective individuals want to do business with one another one's masculine one is feminine so they Define the marriage institution between man and woman but what if corporations is gay wants to do business with Sarah Lee wait a minute what if Uncle Ben wants to do business with Mr Clean that's all I'm saying guys another guy's wait a minute away I'm sorry I thought that was funny what an Audrey I don't think that's what Mr Clean was up  maybe I should have picked different companies I put myself in a bad position I'm just joking around like we don't want to hear this it's just a conspiracy theory I believe in aliens too how about that you're coming aliens they're here all that think World Trade Center fake you wanna know who blew that up for real I ain't gonna say that you know it's my own personal thing I don't even say that  Ashton Kutcher America she has been pumped fake why why did he blow up the World Trade Center I don't want to sound like a cynic  was crazy hmm I don't know the truth but I know who does strippers they know everything does anyone have a cigarette yeah sure good on you Mike I wish I had your accents are so nice and I do listen to BBC News y'all listen to the BBC all right you're listening to the BBC  um GMT all right time to say what time it is it goes GMT what does that mean who's Mountain  Greenwich oh it's the scent oh okay meantime Greenwich Mean Time is that what the phrase meantime comes from wow you can tell that your country conquered a lot of Greenwich Mean Time I learned every day  it's Greenwich Mean Time have you ever heard that before yeah bro you ever heard that before I have no you're from Ireland though Greenwich Mean Time what's so mean about it the time oh okay okay you ever seen a Jasmine man stretch like in the 24 hours like zero zero oh I don't do that 24-hour clock I hate that it's 1500 it costs 1500  no I don't like that this one is good to have them strippers around strippers are like the Google of the streets  never seen someone answered so many questions without crystal ball  it's true it's amazing skill sets there we go it's amazing all right it was something hilarious though all this is depressing and she couldn't blow up those buildings by the way I'm not gonna put that on him huh American people American person is one of the most lied to people in the world that's our whole game with America because freedom is not a privilege my friend it is a burden because a free person has to make choices all the time and you can't make a good choice unless you have the information and in America it's not like China you know in China when they had an earthquake you know what the headline was in newspaper what earthquake they don't tell those people in America they'll tell you every goddamn thing and then they don't prioritize the information you gotta figure all that out for yourself okay all right that's right it won't be breaking out and you'll be like did Michael Jackson them kids that gets shuffled funny because we live in the age of spin you gotta be so smart to live nowadays in the age of spin you watch the news that's not an absolute truth that is a version of the truth people tune into the version of the truth that makes them feel more comfortable sometimes I watch CNN not be feeling bad and I turn the fox you gotta just switch frequencies she deny the truth all the time they'll tell you the truth that's why I like Anderson Cooper because you can tell when he doesn't believe the story he's reading I just work here I don't know hahaha something to it this is It's not that you know what it is about the age of spent because they play so much words I don't even know what the anybody's talking about anymore how can you actually know how can you make a decision it's like you know what I mean the way that we like okay Planned Parenthood right Planned Parenthood is actually for abortions it's for people who didn't clean out so you don't know if you're pro-choice or your anti-consequences the home shooting  if you think about them shits long enough you'll go them crazy and that's when you gotta find a stripper and be like explain this to me you know the dark side semantics man I know I know all right let's go get out of here I'm freaking myself out and I'm hungry and I just got here and then I was like I got in the concert take me to The Comedy Club foreign I mean literally I look at you guys I can't imagine what your story is but I know you okay how old are you guys you're 19. of course they too young to drink but they just the right age to have a great ass time I have been 19. I can't even explain what that was like it's great I mean I'm surprised I mean you know I I mean I remember what it was like I don't know what huh how can I explain what 19. how can you have a good time oh that's right you are Australia a good time without drinking can't you have a great time without drinking I do it all the time I was in Saudi Arabia that didn't bring it throughout the whole time I was there and I had a blast Dave what'd you do for fun Saudi Arabia was fun everybody know that in the circles what oil problem you got to see it to believe in Savage there is no gas station he just  that was great I went to Dubai everyone in this place Dubai how is it well have you ever seen the movie Blade Runner it's like that but Sunny with no robots or problems I was great then there's somebody they building like you wouldn't I mean that look like Legoland that is amazing I'm not exaggerated I've seen a billboard we driving there and check Muhammad Highway whatever it is they got a billboard inside a highway and say we will build your skyscraper I said who the is that for who's gonna pull up oh let me get this number I've been looking for somebody to build my skyscraper yes could you erect the skyscraper for me I saw your billboard we're busy  I mean I'm not exaggerating when I was there they had 212 skyscrapers in production if you can imagine what that looks like 212. you know those big construction cranes half of all those cranes that exist on Earth was in that city building 212 skyscrapers that would be like if somebody said I'm going to build Manhattan in the next eight months that's what's happening on planet Earth today and another 45 minutes probably they're all taking a break and by they all I mean the pakistanis and Bengals everything has a soft underbelly yes where else have I been you guys are British so you've been everywhere I don't care how obscure places I've never gone to places and I've seen a British person it's amazing it's a mate it's amazing I was in Asia I went to the Philippines who said that are you a Filipino oh what's the other half yeah no my wife is Filipina yeah and my kids you know I Puerto Ricans somehow I don't know how that happened I guess when we get together we make up we make Latinos together different parts they've never even been a Puerto Rico oh I'll tell you what have you ever been to the Philippines before okay I went there and I like the Philippines I was actually you know I I did not enjoy the poverty I shouldn't even bring this up I'd say it if sure I was here it's the kind of thing it's like you know when you're comedian you see something horrible you should just only tell other comedians about things because everyone else we had that world view I'll tell you because you're a comedian all right it's not funny at all I'd say it wasn't funny and when I saw it I'll tell you when it was funny okay so we're driving down the street in the Philippines it's like urban area now I don't know if you ever been to Asia traffic not so good as a matter of fact it's horrendous traffic smaller you know it's someone chaotic for me for my American Standards excuse me everybody whatever okay you've seen it you've seen hood movies you can picture bad neighborhoods you've heard all these things but you got to see you know real poverty like when an American sees it you can't help it be like holy okay so so we made a couple turns trying to get out of traffic and then we turned into like it was like the real world real real poverty what do I mean by real poverty well there were tons of things that I saw in that instant like we turned a coin and all of a sudden it was like I've never seen any of this before in my life one of the things was uh because it was Urban setting you have to imagine it's a city but it was a guy and he was it wasn't funny to me this is not my initial reaction and I need to tell you that but you're a comedian so please look at it with those glasses this is like that Kramer moment that was so weird okay we turned a coin and it was a guy he's walking and he had no clothes on right now that that happened in New York but but he the way he was walking was like he didn't have no clothes anywhere it wasn't like he was walking through some clothes he had he was just walking like I'm naked B so so like I know now it wasn't funny to me at all my kids were in the back they were like oh you know they're like five and eight all right snail their reaction to it maybe well they're just because they're kids and I remember what it's like being a kid and he was naked man in the city and we all right so I explained the kids listen guys you know this is what the world is like there's people out here on here today you know there's grandmother's from there she's explained to him mom we all explained to the kids like oh oh snap okay so then we come back to America it's like it's like eight days later and and we split up kids go back to our house I got to go to La takes to kill some business I went to Hollywood for a minute and then my wife calls me up and she said and she's crying I go what's going on she goes she did it I said who did what she's like Manny Pacquiao he won and I said oh that's great you know this happens to finally you know I mean Filipino people feel a lot of Pride with Manny Pacquiao and it was kind of touching the way she felt and then she said he's gonna give his money to the poor and then I say to my wife and this one I hope it gives why they got some pains we love it  it's funny because it was it was it was weeks later and it was emotional moment and it was so emotional I felt a little uncomfortable so I just had a little joke in there about the guy we saw with no pants as a matter of fact this show is dedicated to that guy  not just my set i'm dedicating all these guys laughs it's uncomfortable I really didn't have anything to talk about see that Barack was right we can do this it's going to be great America's gonna be great again you'll all see  because I don't you know I only you know what I'm gonna be honest with you like this is the first time I really voted as I was an Ohio voter so I said this might be important as soon as I walk into the opponent place you know what they said barack's got another one and I said yeah well you know why are you going to assume that I'm a vote for Barack just because I'm black because I'm also rich  maybe I don't want my taxes to go up  that's just my luck as soon as I get some money that's when it's like get a black person like come on Dave let's be responsible right all right  now I'm glad to do it they just raised my taxes this is going to health care I'm glad to do it you know why because Americans should be allowed to be sick if they need to be I hope you have a good trip here do not get sick in this or you would do about our own citizens you think we're gonna help you  I'm gonna pay China back  and I've been to China and I saw the Great Wall of China have you seen it yet anybody here seeing the Great Wall anyone you've been to China are you Chinese no no oh man you must have been so jealous kid you guys got to demilitarized zone that's great I'm gonna have to what do you call it what do you guys got in Korea the DMZ right the something something parallel 45th parallel it's a thin layer of America protecting I'm just kidding did you like the gray wall it was amazing wasn't it you know what because it's the largest man-made object on earth that's what they said and she claimed the tour guide that is the only man-made object visible from space I have you had to confirm that I'm still getting mine I'm still getting my space money together but it was amazing I personally remains because I didn't know that the ancient Chinese people actually had you know Mexicans like that I'm not saying Mexicans built that wall I'm saying Chinese Build That Wall keep Mexicans out of China very Advanced culture America didn't think of that until five years ago I just can't imagine I make that up I'm sorry I thought we're gonna build something to Texas was that me I don't know that wasn't my idea was all right that was an easy joke and it was wrong you know and I and you know what anyway you know if I was if I was the king of world though honestly I would give illegal immigrants just enough legal status so that they could at least get a driver's license and you know I mean call the police if there's something happened you know I mean you can't even call the police you know how much crazy she looked I don't even want to talk it's not this I'll just all right you've seen the paper right I shouldn't even bring this up because it's not funny but it's just an illustration of weird things are headed  you know this is a high incidence of violence in America right and violent crimes and all these like extraordinary crimes you read about and I personally believe that the reason these crimes happen is because our paper chase is so volatile that something about something about America is Criminal to be poor like you know make you feel bad so bad it's like you got to do something still something very desperate about our paper chase just culturally I'm not blaming the government I'm not blaming but it's just evolved into that now uh uh so I'll read I read them sometimes these horrific crimes will happen in in Houston Texas there was a a serial rapist which rape by the way is never funny ever and the only reason I bring this particular rapist up it's because I was victims were men I'm not joking seven men say can YouTube this is really seven men in the Houston area came forward and reported this guy which means he must have raped thousands because that is a very difficult phone call for man to make just saying it's not the same like when you get raped ladies there's no hotline or support group for that the man gets raped and our coach you just gotta get up walk that off everybody these guys don't really care about each other like I can't explain it but I don't know what the British dude would do you might but America you know what I mean in Houston Texas I know you haven't been to Houston yet that's not the that's not like if dudes go out like okay these two dudes might be best friends right and I think I'll say hey let's split a cab home right they're gonna get and his buddy gonna be like he's gonna get out the cab and before he even get over the camp the cab might pull off his buddies they don't play that she needs Houston hey man because y'all uh just wait for a minute tag in the house and I flip the porch lights on and off  you pull off they'll be various hey y'all could have just waited for a minute before I got in the house last night man we was tired all right we had to drop everybody off what's wrong with you what's wrong with me I got raped last night  yeah this is American culture so I can culturally profile these people the victims culturally I could make an educated guess that the victims of these attacks well why and that for any other reason except that black people have such a bad relationship with police in America I don't think they would have called the police I think only one person will feel comfortable enough to make that phone call the way the climate is in America socially you know what I'm saying that's just black people don't call black people don't call police for anything I live in white neighborhood now my white neighbors called the police for everything it's amazing hello police yes um my neighbor is playing their music very loud and I need police intervention for this I don't want to handle this myself It's amazing I've heard black dudes getting shallowed oh call Earl quick quick pistol some shit's gonna that's amazing  huh I just can't see that someone coming to the clubhouse oh oh I got raped man they rape me let me cell phone man I called the police so I can fill out a report oh the police  that nobody rape somebody in our crew we're gonna handle that ourselves what do you mean we'll handle ourselves what you trying to do what we gonna do we can go to their neighborhood and somebody in that crew in the butt that's when I walk in hey guys what's going on hey I just got raped raped I got me today yeah man we're getting ready to go in that neighborhood and one of that crew in the butt  that's when I had my boys in the hood moment  what he's gonna listen my right here and you ain't gonna do nothing Hey listen man all right I got kids and I got family I'm famous all right I got  to lose you can't just be raping people every time I want to settle my differences mama just calling police or something can't call the policeman raped all right this is home let's just think about this okay all right look I got some money all right why don't we just has him some gangsters rape these guys then it turns into The Godfather I got a Little Italy pay them gangsters though maybe driving around the hood there it goes hey you come here let me talk to you for a second and happy looking like I may want to buy some crack hey what's going on guys and then they put him down post pain stand put in their pants and right before that Raven he says Dave Chappelle says hello  and I'm at the Opera and my cell phone vibrous hello it's done okay you say my name  foreign  but but it's so bad that it's you know what it's the kind of joke that I would tell in a nightclub but I would never tell the joke on television even though I might maybe I will maybe I will I have mixed feelings about it because it's actually happened you know what I mean and I want them seven victims to be like Washington and be like  I did a show on the television and I might be doing a concert or something and I'll be walking in the backstage and I'm like hey Dave thanks for the shout out that's awful I know I feel strange about that hole the whole the whole show has been weird for me but you know why I'm doing it for sushi can I have some sushi I'm going to tonight I am going to have sushi dinner no I'm going to go get sushi for myself hopefully with some of their money and you know why because I live in a place in America called Ohio is a great place it was the birthplace of Aviation so they say uh Wright brothers built there little plane there uh uh our license places uh it's the heart of the all at our state motto is With God all things are possible I'll tell you what's not possible in Ohio it's getting a good sushi dinner because it's too far from the water and that's fish be tasting funny as every time I come to New York I try to get myself a decent suit she did and I take picture of it on my iPhone and I send it to my wife with a little caption that says in your  thanks baby and then she takes me back l-o-l you you know we have a funny relationship we really do we have a good relationship you know as a matter of fact it's amazing that she's not with him because I depend on my wife so much my kids think I am their brother  awful I mean hey I was watching TV mom says we can oh  that's crazy it's crazy I got man I don't get me started talking about the kids you know what time my wife when we we argue everybody argues but sometimes like our event on stage it's not it's not cool it's kind of unfair but it makes me feel good and and and one time I was doing that  right and I guess when her girlfriend's in the audience and text messenger and then she come to show with the kids it was an early show so but then I seen her and then I seen the kids and then you know I I had this ego thing so now I feel like well I'm not back then because the kids are here they're gonna have to learn somehow because now I just don't want you know what I mean switch my up it was crazy it was it was the wrong decision after the show in The Green Room argument and she said and I said man I'm talking on that I don't want to talk about this I'll go up like this and my car don't stop so now she gotta give me a ride home I get in the car and try to play like I'm asleep but really I was awake I just didn't want to talk about the show and you know who else was awake my son my oldest son in the back and I hear him says mom what is I I felt awful and then I had to him my poor wife explain to her seven-year-old son it was terrible she was like uh well whoa I can feel her looking at me with hatred but I was still fake well um son is what keeps this family together   I got so many jokes about them kids I'm not ready for that though are you ready for that Sushi dinner spicy tuna I can taste it salmon with the crispy on there what is it you're probably right tempura flakes are you a chef or something you just can tell yeah this is good it is really good  you know when I go in the restaurant you take your shoes off and it'll be like sir put your shoes back on sorry about that I just get into the whole thing like I pretend like I'm  sorry little fellow because I know you're 19 you got a lot of Adventures to get into that city is colony and you're probably too young to remember but there was a song just about what you guys are going through tonight and it came out in the 80s and it goes like this You Belong To The City thank you Belong to the Night living in a river of Darkness beneath some Neon Lights and then there's a saxophone part that's right that's right that's right that's old school music like that you're 19 man it's amazing you don't understand you grew up with the internet I'm just figuring this out you got a satellite television you got a phone in your pocket I just have a cell phone this big if I talk for more than 25 minutes the back of it get hot you got these iPhones I'm still impressed by that have you seen it that is amazing I could put my iPhone out in front of Batman he'll be like what the oh you haven't seen this yet baby yeah I could go five years back in time with my iPhone and when I get back in time it'd be like uh was it five years ago 2003. okay I go back I go back I go back I mean 2004. all right I'll go back in time right I somehow I get access to a time machine now go back in time it's 2004 and I go to somebody that go hey I'm gonna get something to eat where's a good sushi place I don't really know my way around I'm from the future you are not from the future I am too where you from and I put my iPhone out and say I'm from 25 years in the future they believe me but really I feel like I tricky only from five years to the right around the corner about to happen  I'm only from Five Reasons the rape stuff was funnier day well I'm sorry man I thought that was okay you guys don't know what I'm going through I might melt down like Lenny Bruce on this  you don't see them old Lenny Bruce tapes like first he's all funny and then once they start was talking all that trouble he's I should melt down on the show how about Joaquin Phoenix what y'all think about it that was bad all right I watched it and I I watched that whole interview and I said to myself Joaquin Phoenix is a genius that was like the greatest press parents I've ever seen in my life yeah yeah you saw it yeah what'd you think why he was so what he was not no he wasn't strong oh listen I've been hot he was in complete control that situation you understand this is how brilliant it is basically what he's doing is resisting every protocol of what it's like to be on a late night talk show he didn't do any of the banter he didn't do anything hey good to be here Dave we got a new movie coming out he didn't do any of that he's a completely different kind of celebrity than I am by Design of what he does he's a fine actor so you don't know what he's like only time you see why King Phoenix he's in a movie pretending to be somebody completely different and he's very good at it so you can't tell what he's actually like so this is the first time he ever stepped out in front of his work and he was like made a point not to be Charming at all have you been good  what are you working on music what kind of music hip-hop and then everybody left and he goes is that funny I said this guy is a genius 10 minutes on Letterman he was on every publication the next day it was USA Today look how crazy it is everyone was talking about he was a  nut he must have been hiring something why can't he was probably reading that that is brilliant and you know who was the guess on after him was exactly what happened after that why can't one check and mate I said that's the Mel Gibson Playbook right there Mel Gibson beat the game easily and it moved so weird and Abstract I'm surprised no one's done it soon this made a action movie about Jesus check and mate there's no answer to that this guy took 20 million of his own dollars we made an action movie about Jesus  and the movie gross over a billion dollars he made 800 million dollars off a 20 million dollar investment already probably made close to a billion dollars off a 20 million dollar investment do you understand what that will do to your life do you understand how much money a billion personal dollars is can't there's enough money to get pulled over by the police in LA county and jump out of the car like juice what's popping is everything all right you can't say that about the Jews I can't face I'm in rehab over that it never happened before and then followed that up with Apocalypto which was that movie's great have you seen it that  is like Mexican Braveheart that was the best I've ever seen in my life I was talking like that for a week you wanna know why because he made a movie a major Studio Movie he didn't use one Hollywood actor in the entire movie it's not cheap that's amazing he got he got indigenous people from the Yucatan the man how it's amazing you imagine that just going to the Yucatan let me know going there to cast the movies walking up to somebody in a thong have you ever considered acting well my name is Mel Gibson and   I'm telling you right now if I had a sketch comedy show if I had a schedule I guarantee you I guarantee you I would do the funniest Apocalypto sketch but you you couldn't even imagine what I was doing I got an angle on that no seriously I gotta angle on that that's so good I'm like nobody do that  Saturday Night Live nobody would think of the that I would do and it's so simple it's right in the face  if I had a schedule  you know so funny I mean my wife was talking about this makes me laugh foreign    oh my goodness you know I do how long I've been on stage like 25 minutes 30

seriously it can happen you know I've never cheated on my wife that's right I mean I'm not saying that for Applause I mean but I really should get Applause I mean you know I've been going I've been the All-Star Weekend in Las Vegas and then she no more you know how  hard it is for a famous person to not somebody at All-Star Weekend in Vegas listen I'm not brave I'm just saying you a regular people you have to go out and you have got to look for trouble okay I just gotta go out and just starts happening reminding my business walking through the casino trying to get in my room because hey you do yourself hey how's it going buddy hey we got 12 naked in the hot air balloon four o'clock in the morning I've never been on a balloon night before laughs I have to say none of these things all the time and young man I had what's called a old-fashioned courtship you know what that is means there's no sex involved long phone conversations all night hand-hold like this yes I did that you know why why man because at first you'd be like ah he was sexually frustrated they didn't know why you wait long enough and you realize you actually can see the person you're thinking I actually like this person you realize you got something special and it's worth the wait yeah I mean I was other women to hold me over don't be naive  now you know what I don't do it you know what I've been cheating on before we're all human beings right this happens to the best of us I personally didn't like it uh this happens you know you're pretty girl have you ever been cheating on you know no okay he's looking like I'm playing with you you know but you know how them Belgium be throwing man I don't know none of y'all ever been cheating on it y'all never been never huh not that you know oh good on you I've been cheating on and I caught the girl in the act that stay that's bad you clap that's it look the only thing for me I mean you can't imagine how painful that was for me personally only thing worse than seeing it with my own ass and this is just me was fighting a naked man that was gross  three fists you know I'm boxing this up about it and then his dick caught my jeans laughs that was really crazy I mean really crazy because I fought the guy for like two minutes it was disgusting he maintained an erection the entire account I know if you imagine how I felt this is too much what's happening  it's not funny that's not funny though I'm sorry I thought this was a context to say things like that should I read some poetry Don't tell Maya Angelou I'll be talking like this  you know I've seen my Angelo and I went to a house yeah they didn't show this part on television right you gonna take off don't tell Dr Angelo baby are you leaving for real do you want to hear the story it's not all that but it was it is because it's my angel she know what you do see things if he talks to her right I'm not gonna do an Impressions but if you talk to her she can quote literature like she's my Angelo I'm not even gonna tell you this stuff there's nothing it was Shields there's a book by a man named Maggie Valley called the prince kills the whole dad tribe about it who he was you know historical context and I realized I'm talking to a woman who is America's Poet Laureate professor of literature and well Pulitzer Prize whatever she want it all she says she says in this book Maggie Valley says to the prince he must separate the people and if the people cling to one another and refused apart then you must picture them as if they were in a pit and eventually they will push one of their own to the top to be their leader and when they do you must grab their hand and sing them to the Mountaintop with the villa and if they don't no she says and if they refuse the villa you must cut his hell she didn't say that she didn't say it you must cut his head off do you know what that means it means I should have taken that 50 million dollars when I had the chance but you know I don't feel bad about losing that 50 million dollars because what if I have 10 million dollars in the bank okay you know the difference between having 10 million dollars and 50 million dollars 40 million dollars that's right but I have 10 million dollars in the bank I can go to a restaurant and I could look across the room and I say you see that guy over there he has 500 million dollars we're eating the same thing and we made him drives on the same cars and we might even focus on the same girls because I've never heard girls say I would him but he only has 10 million dollars you'll never hear that it's all relative and money is abstract idea anyway I'm serious about that it's out there digitally We're All Digital strippers working like hoes for digital paychecks go to the bank and try to get all your money out if you can probably don't have that much money but if you can then I hope that tax break works out for you but uh yeah over 100 now they're gonna be like we're gonna Mr Chappelle wait a minute now we're gonna need to make a phone call now hold on Michelle there's something wrong with our service that's when you know that you make a lot of money today when they say

I'm not I don't want to grow up it I don't I have to I have no choice what in sagging how you feel young and 19. it's happy 19. you don't even know about that this will be a whole song about that remember that 19 19. 90. you know what it was about Vietnam it's a Saigon that was the average age of drafting you know 19.  holy the 80s were weird remember Max Headroom  and everyone's like it's amazing not really not anymore can't meet me out front the 80s you remember that night rider I love my Lane Michael car with British accent but it was an American car a little thing we're gonna press when he was ready to go we just stole his car laughs kid's just getting hot in here  it's a one-hour television show like that Knight Rider that's right one out you know one time I went on a date with the girls flight attendant and I couldn't tell how old she was she was a fighters in it crazy things happen to their skin and she was black so she could have been anywhere from like 20. to 60. as I asked her because the day I say uh how old are you anyway she says David you're never supposed to ask a woman her age I just got off you know so then I started talking about TV shows like I'm talking to you right now and then I asked I trigger I say what shows did you used to watch and you were little she's like I always like to watch the gun smoke and bananas I said Gunsmoke shoes come on at night time I was like night time she came on after school laughs yep hey what's up man I didn't even recognize you that handle I didn't do anything we supposed to go on tonight oh and I talked all the time I've done that no it is also you know why because you need to pay your dues that was good I'm totally John I'm totally joked I am totally Joker means like you know what happened to me one time I just tell you it didn't happen to me actually no actually no this didn't happen to me something like this happened to me but I'll tell you the one that didn't happen to me because it's funny There's a comic funny comic but he's a new comic and he was bombing on stage one night which is already hilarious you know how that is because as comedians no matter how much religious is people bombing is funny even now it's not going well worse it goes for us the funnier it is so he was bombing but he was having one of those bombs yes it seemed someone bombed so bad they get thirsty  and it kept going pay you do as he was having that throat dry bomb he kept saying pay your dues and I mean it's like I'm bombing now but but this is not really this is not really bombing like you think oh I saw Dave he's not doing so well but you've never actually seen I mean when somebody bombs hey I know it's all right so I don't you know I mean I come in peace if you don't you know you know how it is with somebody bumps you ever seen someone bomb so bad she'll be like I remember this for the rest of my life okay so listen to this um and I'm saying names yes all right so I'm in L.A right showcase for NBC so you can imagine but that's like in LA's Network showcases doing all the comedians come to audition for major American television station this particular night instead of the steps that people normally walk on stage there was a ramp built and they wheel onto the stage the gentlemen they introduce them ladies and Gentlemen please welcome Carl Crazy Legs Fonseca and Carl crazy comes on stage they wheel them up there and I'm not exaggerating this gentleman is a real person is incredibly handicapped they said he has cerebral palsy but I mean it was amazing he was very happy Ryan come back and forth to say so I'm just telling you as an audience member it made me feel a little uncomfortable at first then he starts doing his act guess his first laugh was a good laugh second laugh was even better laugh like by two minutes into his act it wasn't uncomfortable three minutes to his act it was like he wasn't even handicapped anymore I'm talking about seven minutes it was beyond Hancock it was like he was standing tall and by eight minutes he was superhuman listen to me I have never I'm doing comedy over 20 years and I've never seen somebody before then or since then dude this good was amazing I mean he was genuinely silly funny cry starts going nuts and he finished his show he said thank you very much good night and the place erupts I mean I have never seen anything like this good night they whip him off the stage audience is still standing up clapping it was amazing now he's all the way to make another alien Province hi he's in the back still going crazy it's like an inner Purple Rain when Prince walked through the and everybody's on the hallway I mean it was frosting at the mouth people loving them and all that hoopla Apollo  he's a funny dude I call this a cosmic cosmically funny no one constantly funny something is that's when something happens in the room and it might not be funny to the people in the room but the joke is actually told by The Observer because then you say you saw it and then this one this was constantly funny so Nick goes along at the car crazy Ace my second half what I still consider the best set I've ever seen in my life Nick powering on you tell him I said this he had the worst show I have ever seen any Community I mean this dad the most horriblest death ever I mean it was amazing how bad he did and it was the worst kind of bomb because it wasn't like a loud bomb was just like a I could feel hate radiant on all these and you know why he bombed not cause car was so good but because Nick did all handicap jokes at him it was  him right he had to be a comedian to understand how it was so wrong then it might have been the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life like while the whole crowd was like we hate you Nick I was thinking I can't wait to tell somebody about this  I remind him about that almost every time I see him he might want to call crazy lady bad decisions Honestly though if he did his best I don't think there's anything he could have done after that you know who else mom I met Dina John you know Ahmed Dina John the president of Iran he came to New York and he first of all he had the worst introduction in the history of public speaking Camilo Sage this next man many would consider to be a well a complete lunatic he diligently pursues nuclear weapons he denies the Holocaust he thinks that homosexuality doesn't exist in Iran please give a big New York welcome she was awful they should have already introduced them article Club yo he's seen this next  on the History Channel he's been on he's been on CNN and Fox News foreign thank you Audi this lady said this is painful no miss this is hilariously self-indulging you know whatever Comics career you hit a stride on the stage where everyone in the audience becomes an extension of your own imagination it doesn't matter if you do good or bad why what did you want to talk about what did you wish I had talked about  it really I think you're good at least I like your skirt I do I do you know why because it could be an asteroid speeding towards Earth right now and do you think they would even tell your ass no they would not tell you  just in case you miss them once you work every day until the last day to ask oh it is coming so I wouldn't tell y'all what we thought maybe well maybe it might miss we didn't want to slow the economy down because we got to pay China back  everybody's got paid China back and you know what it is about Korea miss it against me my Japanese friends say you copy them but I don't believe that you know what I'm just kidding I'm just trying to start beat and then the Rivalry though Japanese Korean the Sony Samsung rivalry so strip with no  my next time I do a show this information was fact checked by a strip God knows what he's talking about it's triple America so I know it was tripping you know I went to the strip club in England and Soho I don't go strip clubs anymore with any girls but at that time I did and because I was I was around 19. 19. this is a true story it's not even and you know in the age of Barack is be so out of context but just picture this so I go to strip club and it's empty and since your Soho neighborhood right uh I get in there it's like me and another comedian and like two other kind of shady looking dudes and the room is real small we're just kind of sitting there and nothing's happened like nothing and then I don't remember if they had a speaker system or a boombox but like a girl rushes in she's wearing like street clothes she runs into another room and she comes back it comes back uh it is not like a sexy stripper suit but in like a a Jane Fonda workout leotard kind of thing yeah like this one-piece swimsuit stock it's actually happening so we're sitting there with these two Shady guys and she she put some mat down it's like a yoga mat type thing it's actually happened and she looks at she says I'm not gonna take my clothes off I'm just going to do some exercises and we were just sitting there like huh and then she started doing all that like literally like this goes on probably I mean literally she's actually exercising right in my face and this goes on for maybe what seemed like forever it was probably about a good five minutes you know I'm not good with time could have been five minutes could have been out I can't tell in my mind if she's exercising and it's going on and back in these days you smoke a lot of reefer and I can find a reason in any country so I had weed in England I smoke and I'm I started to laugh it's a very small room but I left uncontrolled because I was like this is hilarious is this it out of me it wasn't sexy at all it wasn't any fantasy in it it just was like this weird sad portrait of a woman exercising in front of me it was crazy so okay I'm laughing yeah I don't know if this is even funny it's like that last name side of stuff all right she got serious I started laughing she gets mad and she's and she she stands up but you have the picture how bad this is she's in the game that's just turn around that she's serious but she still got that outfit on and she's like well I'm not gonna dance for another and it was so weird then I started laughing harder and then I say that there's a big monster can a corner I go hey can we get another stripper mine is racist it had to be that was very fun and then they ended up kicking us out like we weren't gonna leave anyway but it was just something about what time is it what's almost one five five minutes all right I'm gonna leave I'm gonna walk off stage you no no I'm Gonna Leave because uh because the place is still open until two so I'm gonna go there but if you do this all right well you know what because in New York you can do anything so late at night you know you know what I mean right now I'd have been sleeping and seriously I'd be probably asleep all right  man you guys dressed good well this stinks it does next thing

regular gas and he's just walking up the street oh he was a bartender at one of the bars around here and they look on that little TV screen I saw you and you saw me and you were like I haven't seen this episode and you know how to live you walk right in the doors like I'm just gonna get a glimpse of this dude sir you are witnessing right now something that rarely is seen me Bali huh you're right I do love to watch them let me tell you something my favorite comedy tape is Richard Pryor is still smoking have you ever seen this at The Improv in Hell's Kitchen about 40 minutes long it was the crowd was freaked out he started to show you say a little nervous I haven't done any cocaine all day it is insane this house and then he started doing these routines about his mom sucking people's dicks I mean just like he's crazy you ever seen this and then he say uh I mean he said crazy it is weird isn't it he said he says on that tape he says he says never let a  suck your dick cause they'll tell and the crowd's just like this is the weirdest it was so weird thing I like about the tape is this okay so he does all these routines a bombs you can tell he's kind of nervous because I mean he'll say something real crazy he'll be looking there he'll say something crazy and he'll look up look at her I like just see what it does to him he stops freaking him out I can tell he's even freaking himself out which happens was good though right and then uh at the end they show the list all the jokes remember this part let's say you just got to it and it's like a list of jokes in his handwriting some of the words are misspelled and damn it every joke on that list became like one of his famous routines but you could tell was like the beginning he's just working it out and it's just stunk why am I telling you that because I need you to know that that Houston rapist is hilarious I was telling male rape jokes tonight sir you missed it I did jokes about uh bombs bursting air and eating sushi made out of Japanese people I was saying like really crazy stuff but I don't know one of these shits might be a winner maybe useful the Brits don't think so good comedy is a little different just a little bit when I go to Britain I have to do like they like they like a little more thought of preparation you guys got a little more polish to your I think so no who's your top comic writer I remember Lee Evans from my 20th birthday party he was at the Edinburgh Festival that year and he won the Perrier award the Evans he was into something about Mary movie smashing but he's not he was a guy to remember one guy fake like he was handicapped all right that's that guy's actually British he played America in the movie his name is Lee Evans but his act is very physical like to an American you wouldn't laugh so much like you know Americans like guys like Russell Brand like crazy we like craziness we like people that say crazy who yeah sweat yeah you kind of like the Admiral and if American comments they'd be like you're fake in Australians you guys are more like us as far as your comedy sensibility because you're a penal colony totally joking totally joking sir none of them  you a penal comment I don't know if that's true or not it's her it isn't well we a penal colony I heard that about America is that true that America was a penal colony and we just rewrote our history no we were pilgrims well what have we learned in the last few hundred years I think we've learned that starting a country is a messy business which requires a lot of hard work just shouldn't do yourself it was import some Negroes systematically dehumanize them foreign they did happen that happened I'm sorry everybody that happened and I have an entire mini-series to back me up and that many series called roots and you can probably take a look at it huh  uh according to my brother he is it's the thing we do that's actually funny to say that we do that in my house we call out characters from Roots and my brother said I'm Chicken George and I say I'm Kunta and it's kind of fitting you know what because Chicken George was a strategist who fought chickens and veered his chicken fighting skills managed to get himself free and his family free I'm Kunta the runner I'll come back for you and then I get caught and I'll be like I was gonna come back but I got caught anyway and I guess my sister would be like kizzy remember kizzy was writing on the table and he can't read it used to be illegal for black people to read in America did you know that it's true even now Barack Obama has a sneak and read trying to look over these bills with just trying to read the bill about repealing the law about me not reading these bills I'm just kidding those laws are long gone you see young ladies our constitution was in a mendible document that changed with the hearts of people so we thought that's why that's what they said don't you know anything about American history anything you know Benjamin Franklin was oh modern world history is mainly American World History still on top so can't stop won't stop laughs America that was playing after 9 11 America was like puppy they don't want

music you haven't caught up and I hate to tell you this you're never gonna catch up not in that genre and he never had a Richard Pryor your country could never produce amalgamix nor would it nor is he

take the lines on the map seriously right I'd be like me saying I'm half from Ohio and half from Michigan it seems like it's not that far away although I didn't meet somebody from Cardiff right and I

me I have important literally important things to do and I and this is just I can't tell you how much fun this is for me you know why because weird as this is I'm I just think it's great and I will deny that I was over here so my reputation will be intact that's good what reputation all right you know what you could be my British girlfriend I gotta ask my wife you'd be a good candidate because you defended me and that's what house how me and my wife first fell in love let me tell you something back during our courtship right our sexist courtship I used to have all these schemes of how I get her to sleep with me one of the skins that I would invite her to a show this is a pretty harsh story I said I'd invited to a show and then I'd wow her with my blah blah blah blah you can imagine how this game goes but the plan went horribly arrived I was at Carolines I'm sorry bring up another club that's who I was and it was some kind of weird function there that night and I was heckled by a lady who wanted Rich Apple East Side women for you know rich white lady and the only reason I imagine she's white was relevant to the story is that in the course of heckling me when she had them I don't really mind but you got to remember you got to remember circumstance I got a girl that I'm trying to impress and I'm a lot younger and and of course heckling me she called me a monkey you right which has this weird racial overtone and you know again now even if that happened to me now I don't think that it would not as much to me as it did at that moment and that moment I was like Fierce because apparel was dead and I flipped out I Jeremiah write it out on this I was just like yo if you shave a monkey down is it black or white answer the question it's like going oh crazy and uh as I'm yelling at her I see my girlfriend named my wife before she gets up she starts walking towards the door so now real embarrassed and as she's walking towards the door she walks right over to the latest type and she leans into her ear like a whisper and she says you are a  real loud and we screamed it in her ear and I was on stage like oh my God I'm falling in love little did I know that years later all that anger would be directed at me real life life has a funny way you know which is like I said you could be my British girlfriend because you see the defender she wasn't pissing  I don't know what does that mean taking the piss you can be my other Bridge girl all you have to do is plant a flag in something and it's yours if history has if history has taught us nothing else and that's why

and then I mean everybody described me to say everything everything is gonna happen time to get paid blow up like the World Trade remember that global warming This Is Why I'm Hot see that's good yes what's out there though you know why if it's rock music it was rap music it was whatever music you listen to artists uh the truth you know what because everybody gets information but only artists can interpret information on an emotional and an intellectual level simultaneous they can make you think and feel about something at the same time no matter what kind of music it is that's why whenever a society goes through this turmoil and the government wants to repress the people they always go after the artist first always always always but if you tell jokes you're safe she's only gonna tell no political jokes a political joke yeah all right so I'm Nancy Pelosi right now I don't even I don't even know what that sounds like but she does have some she got some nice titties Sarah Palin yes or no no  no I like this guy's standard she's like yeah yeah yes okay that's the thing we need the I like that though you know why because if you can imagine yourself having sex with women like this do you know what that means that means that you look at powerful people as people anything  yeah are you a musician for real okay what do you play rock guitar ain't a boy you 10 bar and you play rocket talk do you know what that means wow you're my best friend holy that's your best friend this evening no yeah that's true it means all those things it also means you have excited one pretty good it's

this table's ice cold that happens oh thanks you know we met my friends from Montreal haven't you you speak French I will not like we're living oh are you from Tina Vancouver you're from Vancouver you're from Russia now I got a quote Rocky four that's good hey did you live in Russia yeah really yeah you missed the 80s you don't miss Russia at all let me tell you about in America in the 80s we used to make movies and talk about Russians so bad every movie have you heard of a movie called Red Dawn  I just you gotta rent this movie Justice it's a it's a welcome piece of propaganda man you know what the movie's about there's some kids in the high school right they're in school hanging out all of a sudden parachutes started coming there and the Russians invade America I'm telling you they made a move it is the most ridiculous ever so then like the Americans have a rebellion against the Russian division it's how it will never happen that's called red doing it and you've got to rent it and you will you will be laughing hysterically especially being from Russia you're gonna love that  I mean you're gonna hate it but you're gonna hate it so much because you're gonna love it and then and I'm telling you that you know why because they're remaking it again because this time it's the Chinese it's gonna be a billion parachutes I saw in basic training huh they took us to it and basically I was in basic training they took us to go see that they took you to see Red Dawn you and basic training and you were like we're gonna them up  propaganda is awesome it's effective that is effective when I was when I was in the 19. see that in America yeah man you're supposed to be able to have fun you're supposed to be thinking oh yeah go ahead man write your cigarette up live your life instead of chasing that paper I said the woman that got beat up in the Lamborghini oh no it was a Lamborghini she said don't change the paper he's what you were saying that Lamborghini I don't know I'd be thinking everything's fake I'm sorry I'm a skeptic I'm a skeptic I don't should be doubting something though good for you question this guy just said I'm doubting it I used to be Cable's hardest star at least that's what they told me  uh hello darkness my old friend so uh free he was in basic for what branching service I was in New York really Airborne I was Airborne 82nd you 80 Seconds you guys first news to show up so if Red Dawn was in Reverse he would be parachuting on your country I did Panama you you was in Panama I heard that was actually kind of much worse than people thought it was like a hot war zone format that's crazy I don't even know what happened to Panama something about Grenada and some Noriega I don't know why oh that's right we did do that didn't we remember that you don't remember this that's when the United States yeah but he just said he called Noriega pineapple face what'd you go to high school with them hey pineapple face that was awful and hilarious how many people was paying them all was it a huge operation like three battalions Maybe six seven thousand wow that was great they're just like arrested that dude didn't it yeah yeah it took a while he was he was hold up yeah he was held up they had to drive him out they used the speakers and they played music oh that works you can see so I like I'm gonna need to check Panama out birthday at me for now cigarettes are like a dollar I know about that holy this guy's got like all these supply lists now I can't believe it can you imagine that would never happen here could you imagine like I don't know someone invaded America and arrested there's no way we lived in here you could have he couldn't arrest America who gonna wrestle the out of here  wow that actually happened was it scary you're not supposed to add soldiers things like that so it was a bad question but I'm just curious what they say scary like not really you don't even think about it because he's Young it's another world I'm like I always admire how people can put that kind of behind her I'd be dwelling on this like it was yesterday it was scary that's why I'm not cut out with the military I'm just like you know

energy out and we'll just walked in with a big old Pizza no thank you thank you for coming out the sushi place across I heard Dave where do you live in Ohio why do I live in Ohio honestly Ohio yeah there's like a whole stack of reasons I mean what it's quiet what was one reason I heard you actually live on a farm I live in a working farm that's absolutely right you see the thing is think about it like this once you make over like say no not even I look at like the average price of an apartment in New York is 1.2 million dollars person make over two million dollars in a year has to pay over 200 000 in taxes just to live in New York New York I play city tax and you got to pay state tax right and you can live anywhere else in America with a high quality of life for way lower cost of living than New York so at a certain point even in California at certain point ask my friends to say yo why we work so hard all the time just so we could be in New York because it's New York you know if I want to get signs of pizza at four o'clock in the morning I can do that as long as you can build your whole lifestyle around a hypothetical slice of pizza you may or may not want you know they make

why am I so cold oh I forgot it's all right it's all right man  one and you just give up he turned he didn't know exactly who said it so he turned to the room and said why don't you keep up for real man you all right you're the kind of person that nothing bad will ever happen to two days now you have stomach ulcers for two days and you're still giggling it up and drinking don't you see your Teflon you are like the bionic acid they made them for six million dollars minus the exchange rate  wow think about that if I had taken in 50 million dollar deal I could have bought Bionics if a bionic man only costs six million dollars Australia I could get parts of mine oh man I won't even do my whole body I'd be like he's saying that he's having a good ass time in whatever language he speaks have you ever been to a show where an audience member gets ripped on by other audience and the comedian can't really defend him that well see people say Dave why do you stay on stage so long because if I hang out long enough something like that will happen and I like to see these kinds of things no it's a rare it's it is good fun I could have done a lot of things to have fun but nothing would be as fun as this what am I going to play video games again thanks for saying all this luck  what the baby joke yeah oh man I haven't done that joke since that night that's a great joke it's

Panama operation just said that off the top of your fish and they were arresting course present pineapple face a Panama you know Manuel Noriega heard you say that it will probably hurt his feelings yeah he's still in jail he'll never get out of jail how you gonna get out of jail after you got arrested by the army that's a bad sign you know what that is that's like when you when you're in Grand Theft Auto and you get all five stars that's an article oh no yeah you got that he had five stars on Grand Theft Auto the Army you know what's great about this part of the night if I say like have a joke you guys will finish the entirely I can just lay back with a pen and paper no you know what's the funniest thing I was just thinking like a minute ago I'm not gonna remember anything with it

through your jacket why would I steal your jacket in front of all these people oh that's true the crap  he's all right don't ever admit that I got a drink if you can keep yourself hey I've been with someone that's pissed on himself cut to the inside of a stumbles also eating it up like a piece of chicken like if I was directing a movie about this night I would cut to the inside of his stomach and I would just show like food in there  I also eating them up and then after I show all the stuff that's going on the stomach I cut his heavy face then I will cut out to his girlfriend walking in the cold by herself and the guy tried to talk to her she goes no don't mess with me because my boyfriend's a killer and then I come right back to the inside of the snow and it would be two chicken wings in it it's like a little like half a handful of rice on top sparsely scared of the chicken wings all right yeah yeah that's hilarious and there's some Skittles in there and then there's like blood oozing out of the hole is awesome  and you know what I do just to be stupid but I put like a gum wrap right now just one thing that shouldn't be in there at all right it could be hoverboard oh you know not even a gum rep you know what I put in your stomach okay so it's two pieces of chicken half ample rice Buzz dripping out and then on top of the rice I kind of what the is that and I'm pushing slow and you're gonna look and it's gonna be the head of one of them little Lego men and some little Lego here that's a joke I remember do you remember the joke I said I have a house I had him build a

Dave Chappelle,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N4UFl9G00A,all right here's the story i started doing stand-up comedy when i was 14. i'll never forget the first time i was on stage the guy that introduced me was a guy named jt newton i'm 47. i can close my eyes and remember the introduction like it was yesterday it went like this ladies and gentlemen this next young man coming to the stage is starting his comedy career tonight who knows we may be witnessing the birth of a star please welcome david chapel from the first time that i ever held a microphone i was sure this was it i knew i was home i knew i had found my thing and my god man my god man i was a child i got good matter of fact i was good from the moment i started and i'm not saying this to be a bracket i'm telling you the truth these old  was in awe of me how was this little boy so poised they used to say that was i mean you know i got better but it started out good about a year into it when i was 15 years old i had written a joke during the aids epidemic about having a good year condom something i don't even remember the joke something about an industrial strength condom by goodyear i just remember all the comedians really liked that joke and there was an older comedian and he came to me one night after the show after he saw the joke and he said listen i got an audition at another comedy club and i was wondering do you mind if i do that joke i just i just want to borrow it now i'm a kid i don't know any better i'm like borrow it well i guess sure if it'll help your career i let him do the joke and then weeks later i was waiting to go on in the comedy club and he went on before me and he did the joke and after the show i pulled him aside and i said hey man i don't mind you borrowing my jokes but you got to give him back he said oh i forgot to ask you he goes let me buy that joke from you for fifty dollars and i said man i'd do it but i'm just starting out i need all the material i can get the idea being that the more material i can accumulate the faster i'll be able to make money for my work i said i can't do it i want my joke back i'll never forget this remember i was a 15 year old child this guy was a grown ass man he stood up over me so i could see how big he was and he said to me really i can just take it and he did i got scared because i was a child but i never forgot that i never forgot that i was 15 years old i'm 47 now i think about this guy all the time when i look at my own kids and i see how young and innocent they are i can't believe someone did that to me and i don't think about it every day because that was the worst thing that happened to me i think about it every day because that was the first time someone ever did that to me but in my career it has happened many many times since when someone would intimidate me or scare me and take something that i believe was mine tell you another story now i'm 18 years old i'm living in new york city and i just finished my first road tour which was a very difficult tour i'll spare you the details now i'm back in new york but my rent is paid thank god and i have 60 dollars to my name and a woman that i met in pittsburgh a bad dominican  was coming to new york she was going to spend the weekend with me i couldn't wait for her to get there she was coming that evening remember i only had 60 hours for a whole weekend to entertain a bad  now i'm walking through greenwich village and i see something i've never seen before three card monthly you know what that is yeah the guy had the whole thing the table was set up and he had the three cards and the crowd was hooting and hollering and he was like find the red card find the red card and people were playing sometimes they win sometimes they lose but it was really exciting and i'm standing there watching it and i noticed while i'm watching them play this game that the red card the one you're trying to find had just a little bend on the corner and i'm watching and i'm like yo this guy doesn't seem to know that red card is bit i'm gonna beat this  and i walked up to the table and i said let me play a hand and i put my last sixty dollars on that table and he starts to shuffle and find the red card find the red card and i kept watching that bent card go around the table make sure i kept my eyes on that bent card and when he stopped shuffling and he said find the red card i pointed to it with confidence here it is right here and he flipped it over and it was black and he took my money i couldn't  believe that how did this  do that was that magic or sorcery i was confused so you know what i did i sat there and i watched him for a real long time play the game and i realized that all those people who was doing all that hooting and hollering and betting my god they were his friends they were in on the whole thing i felt so wronged i felt so stupid and then the next sucker came up to the table and was about to put his money down and i said  that man don't put your money there all these  is in on it it's a trick and when i said that the guy that was dealing and this  was huge snatched me up by my column feel how strong he was when he grabbed me i was a skinny little guy and he was going to maul me the only reason he didn't i'm sure is because he saw the fear in my face and that fear he looked at me i saw his eyes go from hard to soft he softened then he looked at me like the way our father would look at a child and he said to me young man don't ever come between a man and his meal i never forgot that either most  would have to run the streets for years to learn a lesson that profound it took me two seconds never get between somebody and their paper taking a man's livelihood away from him is akin to killing him do you know why prince the famous rock star that was a friend of mine do you know why he called himself the artist when he came back he calls himself the artist because that's what they call us in our contracts all these contracts are crazy you should hear the terminology they say in these contracts to use your name and likeness and perpetuity throughout the universe who the  could possibly know what that means nobody does it's so complicated in fact that when you're a kid like me you have to hire somebody to tell you what that means and you sit down at a table and you do the contract game that's how i got with comedy central i signed the contract but i signed the contract the way the 28 year old expectant father that was broke signs of contract i was desperate i needed a way out and it wasn't good money and it wasn't good circumstances but what else am i gonna do i said and all these white people sitting at that table told me trust us dave it's a good contract and i looked around the table and they all seemed to agree it was a good contract but what if what if it was like that game of three card monty what if they were all friends and i didn't know it and the bag of money was icebergs money in the first place what was i talking about what was i trying to tell you last week two weeks ago whenever it was i called lauren michaels and i tell him okay i'll do it i'll do saturday night live on election night and and the day i made that phone call the day i committed to it it gets announced that netflix is streaming chappelle's show not just netflix hbo max is streaming it too tell you another story about hbo no hear me out did you know before chappelle's show was at comedy central i pitched that show to hbo i i told him what i wanted to do now these are executives all they have to do is say yeah we'll take it or no thank you we won't but they didn't say either those things they went too far they said literally what do we need you for that's what they told me as they kicked me out of the office what do we need you for and here we are all these years later and they're streaming the very show that i was pitching to them so i'm asking them what do you need me for  people think i made a lot of money for chappelle show when i left that show i never got paid they didn't have to pay me because i signed the contract but is that right i found out that these people were streaming my work and they never had to ask me or they never had to tell me perfectly legal because i signed the contract but is that right i didn't think so either that's why i like working for netflix i like working for netflix because when all those bad things happen to me that company didn't even exist and when i found out they were streaming chappelle's show i was furious how could they not how could they not know so you know what i did i called them and i told them that this makes me feel bad and you want to know what they did they agreed that they would take it off their platform just so i could feel better that's why i  with netflix because they paid me my money they do what they say they're gonna do and they went above and beyond what you could expect from a businessman they did something just because they thought that i might think that they were wrong and i i do i think if if you are  streaming that show you're fencing stolen goods they stole that from me they just took it and i'm not up here trying to tell you guys that i believe that comedy central gave me a raw deal just because i'm black i believe that they gave me a raw deal because this  industry is a monster it's the same monster that these me too  was trying to tell you about but they hate the monster for how it  and i hate that monster for how it eats but my god man it's the same monster when i quit the show all my friends would say well  them dave why don't you just do chappelle's show at another network yeah yeah yeah and why doesn't a slave run from one plantation to another plantation because the master over there might be nicer my god man i was trapped you know what tell you the truth tell you the truth i've even thought about coming back and doing another chappelle show well but if i do i can't call it chappelle show because my name and likeness is being used by them in perpetuity throughout the universe it's in the contract  you're not supposed to do this in my business i'm up here doing something that nobody else in this business has the balls to do i'm telling you something that you need to know i'm trying to explain to you what you're seeing you don't understand what you're seeing i am publicly flogging a network and i know that this network  they they watching me and they saying why why why are you doing this so so publicly then feel good to be flogged publicly oh believe me i know i know exactly how that feels when i quit my show they said i was crazy what was crazy about it i just didn't want to do it anymore they said i smoked crack that's impossible i was a devout muslim i didn't smoke or drink but i do now  cause you ruined my  life  now it's their turn this is their first  lesson and i'm honored to give it to them they're gonna pay me for this show i called my agent i said is there anything i can do about this show and he said no well  you too then you want something done right i guess you gotta do it yourself so i'm not going to the agents i'm coming to my real boss i'm coming to you i'm begging you if you ever liked me if you ever think there was anything worthwhile about me i'm begging you please don't watch that show i'm not asking to boycott any network boycott me boycott chappelle show do not watch it unless they pay me if you're a shareholder at viacom then i'm talking to you because all that  that they do to us well they do everything for their shareholders that's what they told me so if you're a shareholder in that company tell them it's wrong and if you don't believe that it's wrong then  you too  should know what's in the hot dogs you eat now there's probably a bunch of people at comedy central and viacom and all these places that have no idea what i'm talking about they've all

Dave Chappelle,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xb_ac9ky29I,"okay before I did Killing Him Softly when I was 22 HBO gave me the biggest opportunity of my life at that time they gave me a half hour special but this  was not like a special you know what I mean it was like generic it didn't even have a title it was just Dave Chappelle and I shot it in San Francisco at a place called Broadway Studios which is on the second floor of a building and beneath Way Studios is a nightclub and the special was only supposed to be 30 minutes and I got ready I practiced I did all the  I was supposed to do and and the night that I taped 20 minutes into my 30 minute set I'll never forget this music music Started blasting from the nightclub underneath you could hear real loud and it  my whole show up and I was devastated I was a young man man I really believed in what I was doing and I thought that my dream had been killed so when I got off stage I ran down the steps to the alley behind Broadway Studios and where the control trucks are parked and I kicked that  door open and I started yelling at all the producers I was nobody in Show Business just a guy that believed in my I said man you  everything up that  music what the  were you thinking and there was a a guy who was a big Big Time producer I ain't saying no names and he stood up and he said Hey kid sit the  down he said we didn't ruin anything he said we made a deal with that nightclub to not play music and they didn't honor the deal and I said who did honor the deal and he pointed to a guy I'll never forget it was old white man sitting in the four tus by himself and he said that guy right there and I didn't waste no time or ask no questions I went to that Ford tourist and I beat on that window and I said open the door  I want to talk to you and that old man looked at me for one second and wisely drove the  off and left me in the alley cussing at anybody who would listen and 2 minutes later literally 120 seconds later couldn't have been any more than that the doors of the kitchen in the alley of that nightclub underneath Broadway Studios flung open and and that old man was standing there that same old man with reinforcements he had two big goons with him and he looked at me he was calm as a cucumber he said you come here I want to talk to you I didn't know anything about the streets this age but I found out later in my life that these men were were Russian mobsters and I don't know what you guys know about the Russian mob but these are the  that killed Denzel in Training Day and all the producers knew what I was up against they said Dave do not go in there and I said  y'all and I walked right into that kitchen and they closed the doors behind me and it got dark as  in there and I knew I'm not dumb I knew I was in a bad situation but you have to understand I believed in what I was doing and I didn't give a  just kept cussing at these  telling them how they ruined my life and that old man man couldn't believe that I was talking all this  and as soon as I took a breath he stopped Me Gently he said Hey kid listen your friends lied to you he said we made a deal but your friends never paid me and when he said that I realized I was locked in a kitchen I realized he was telling the truth truth which would make me wrong and the moment the very moment that I realized I was wrong for the first time I was afraid you see it's a funny thing if you believe you're absolutely right you can get drunk off the feeling of how right you are it's why gay people are so mean but I didn't buckle you guys would have been very proud of me I was scared but I didn't Buckle I said well then sir I owe you an apology but I believe that no matter what reason that music was playing it ruined my life and that old man looked at me with with sympathy in his eyes and he walked over to me and he he gently placed his hand on my cheek which I got to tell you you it's a very emasculating thing to do I was standing there looking at this nigga's hand on my cheek like and he said you are a real man and he ta me on my cheek real soft just like that the doors open back up the light from the alley flooded into the kitchen and I just walked out alive I lived to fight another day and in that moment I learned one of the most valuable lessons of my life and I have to share with you and that lesson is this in your life in any given moment the strongest dream in that moment wins that moment I am a very powerful dreamer yeah I'm not  lying I dream tonight this very night as a 14-year-old boy and I am living it as a 50-year-old man my dreams are very strong today I walked all around Washington I used to be poor in this city and all day people just said hey Dave hey Dave like they knew me personally and I felt like I knew them and I say to myself my God Dave what a powerful dream but then sometimes sometimes I feel regular feel like myself maybe I'll smoke some weed and be some nightclub and feel shy but I look across a nightclub and I'll see some guy that no one's ever heard of but this  worked all week and got bottle service and his  bringing moette with sparkers to him I picture in my mind he's Persian he's doing some kind of weird Persian dance and he got six  at his table cuz he got so much lior and they all call him saying go Cena go Cena and I'll be looking across the room like oh my God I'm in that guy's dream I can hear him telling his friends hey how was the club last night man that  was fantastic I had bottle service I seen D pelc cross Club looking at me like oo who is that and that's the trick to life you have to be wise enough to know when you were living in your dream and you have to be humble enough to accept when you're in someone else's it's why it's why I don't judge between Will Smith Chris Rock because you guys look at them as big ideas but I look at them as fellow dreamers I can't judge between them because I see myself in both of them I am Will Smith I am the man that cannot take it anymore and will slap the  out of the next person that says a cross word to me or somebody that I love and I am Chris Rock I am the man that can get slapped in front of the whole world world and keep my composure so I don't  anything up that is what men do men make boundaries men enforce boundaries and Men test boundaries and no man tests more boundaries than a trans man when I see a fellow dreamer I give them my utmost respect even if I don't understand what their dream is I know a dreamer when I see one and I've met many powerful dreamers in my life none more powerful than a man who calls himself little nzx I met this  at a party I had no idea who he was but the minute he walked in that party I knew I was in his dream everybody in the party was another dream everyone was famous but when that  walked in he was dressed like c3p he was shining and everyone was like oh my god there he is that's little I didn't know who he was and for some reason out of all them dream was he walk right up to me and he said I tried to get you in my video I don't know what the  he's talking about I said what I said what what video and he just looking at me like you know what video and walked away and I watched him walk away I said man I said this nigga's having a very powerful dream you know what it reminded me of it reminded me of when we was in grade school remember in grade school the teacher would ask everybody what they want to be Timmy Timmy what do you want to be when you grow up and Timmy acted like he had an idea he'd stand up he say I want to be a fireman and the teacher would say Timmy that is a beautiful train but Timmy didn't mean it Timmy said he wanted to be a fireman cuz deep down Timmy's attracted to fire by the time he's 14 years old this  is a full-blown pyromaniac playing with carine and matches like a goddamn expert and then one night he goes downtown with his buddies  around with fire and burns a warehouse down and he doesn't know it but there's 13 migrant workers from El Salvador and they're in that  they get trapped and then they die in the fire ain't that a tragedy ah it was an accident he's only 14 years old but ah he's black so they try him as an adult and Timmy ends up spending the rest of his life in jail Dream Deferred what about you Billy Billy Billy what do you want to be when you grow up and Billy stands up and he says I want to be president of the United States and te says oh my God Billy Billy that is a wonderful dream and Billy means that  Billy does everything right that  gets his grades up he joins Student Government he even does extracurricular activities like show choir just to make his resume look good he's on track to be president but junior year he wipes when he's 16 he gets his girlfriend pregnant and has to drop out of high school to make y meet but lucky for him the local Walmart's hiring by the time he's 20 years old this  makes assistant manager at Walmart he's the youngest one in the district he says oh my God if I can keep this up for four more years I could be a manager and if I can keep this up for six more years after that I could even be a regional manager and have as many as three Walmarts under my control and he's a big picture guy he sees where this path is going so he kills himself  but what about you what do you want to be when you grow up I don't want to say cuz I don't want the other kids to laugh at me who cares if they laugh your dream is yours own your dreams so they can come true say it loud and proud what do you want to be when you grow up little NX that  stood up in front of the whole class I want to be the gayest  that ever lived I want to do a music video and slide down a stripper pole all the way to the depths of hell and suck the devil's dick at 10:00 on BET while all the kids are awaken can see me shockingly that was the only dream that worked out that's why I'm here tonight in the city where I built the dreams that I live because I wanted to tell you all that they came true and I wanted to thank you all for making the man that I am today yes I am living a very powerful dream every time I come to this city and I stand in front of you I realize that my God man this is not my dream at all it's yours and I am honored to be in it thank you very much Washington DC I'll see you next habit of raping dick breath the  has been going on out  here keeps get wor just you think it can't get worse they got Charlie Rose today it's going to be a quiet morning on the news tomorrow Charlie Rose who's next Captain Kangaroo everybody is raping like hot cak I for one I'm starting to get worried you know I've been in the show business 30 years I had no idea how much danger I was in it's really some scary  I got to tell you Harvey Weinstein's probably the first person that I ever looked at a photograph of and was like yeah he rapes not sure this  has a choice  not a handsome man lot of meat and extra skin on his  face yeah he's ugly you know the sad part is he's done so well in life he probably doesn't know he's ugly you know when you're goodlook everybody will tell you oh you look wonderful you're so great looking when you're ugly you got to figure that  out for yourself it's a lot of putting Clues together who is is why am I not getting in the club I got all the right   on cuz if it was Brad Pit doing that  you would have heard the people girl just come back down like I got the part yeah yet and yet it is important that I acknowledge ladies you are absolutely right there you go they got all be mindful of that guys because uh this could happen to any of us could happened to me I can see that see myself showing up hi am here from my 3:00 a.m. with Mr Weinstein hey Harvey I got your text I'm here to talk about the script seems like it's going to be hard to read and candle light but I guess I could try sound like a  nightmare could you imagine that  did you imagine if you was in a business meeting and a  pulled their dick out in the middle of the meeting I'll be like yo yo my man this is the most unprofessional  I've ever seen in all my days just let me finish stage pal I'll put you in all three Lord of the  Rings hurry up  I have other meetings know I have a 4:30 a.m. at Brett ratner's house and I believe it's wardrobe fitting  wow I mean it is really bad out here isn't it Kevin Spacey's out here grabbing Men by the  I didn't even know that was possible Jesus Christ he got the guy from Star Trek the Next Generation that's who he uh that's what he got well that's I sound like he was more than that but that's who that's who Set It Off 14 years old and Kevin spy cost him at a party which I got to say by the way for the record been to a lot of parties in my day never been to a good one that had 14-year-old boys in it not even when I was 13 you know what I mean who wants to kick with a bunch of Hubba Bubba chewing  like having a good time  yeah ironically kid grew up to be gay anyway which means Kevin Spacey can sniff that  out like a truffle pick yeah he's one of me and not the victim blame but it seems like the kind of situation that a gay 14-year-old would get himself  into I know I didn't say that right but it's true  like you know why I say that though cuz I went to an art high school and like oh them  was gay man like in high school all them dudes was gay and them gay dudes was way more mature than the rest of us and we didn't know why we just knew they was mature you ever see gay dude in lunch perfect posure they s it e responsible then take that thermos out he be like what the  is that is this  drinking wine with lunch we didn't know what it was cuz we were young boys we just trying to figure out who we were and we didn't realize these gay dudes was fighting to be who they knew they already were some impressive  they were Fearless to gay kids  Fearless I've never seen a scared gay dude in my life what kind of man has no fear you be tied up in a hostage situation with a gay dude them  will still be like I'm thirsty  I'm thirsty David I need something to drink well then shoot me I would rather die of a bullet than dehydration  I am thirsty I need some  water all jokes aside Kevin spacy shouldn't have done that  to that kid she's 14 years old and was forced to carry a grown man secret for 30 years Jesus Christ he must have been busting at the scenes with that one the saddest part is if he were able to carry that secret for six more months I would get to know how House of Cards ends   yep ladies and gentlemen these are dark dark dark times New York Times said uh that Louis C  on his own stomach I've busted a lot of n in my day none of them were newsworthy  was really gross cuz they didn't just say it like I said it they didn't just say jizm something they said it in that  pull it surprise winning style that the New York Times heads was very descriptive like you know what I mean Louis C Sean shot out like a volcano of massagy slowly drizzling down like lava covering his freckled penis as it slowly dripped to a fiery crown of red hair Jesus Christ I'm trying to eat some wos ranch arrows and these  is you know the tough part being a comedian knowing the  everybody comes up to me like did you know did you know what Lou was doing no  I did not know the  you think we talk about the comedy club hey  how's the weekend great man I just jerking off in faces and coming on my own stomach having a good time you know how this business is no I didn't know they act like we sit around like Greece tell me more tell me more she put up a fight sorry I don't know the choreography but you get the point you get the point she was intense but Louis was like the turning point I mean you know I all these allegations are terrible Lou was the only say this but  it he's his allegation is the only one that made me like  laugh what you be thinking about cuz all his friends is reading it and he's jerking off and he's surprising people he's  surprising that's picture all the comics and comedy just reading it like what it's terrible I know it's terrible I'm sorry ladies you're right you are right but at the same time I mean you know what I mean I don't know Jesus Christ they took everything from Louis I was like I don't know it might be disproportionate I can't tell I can't tell this is like we're it's hard to be a man one lady said Lou CK masturbating in front of me ruined my comedy dreams word well then I dare say Madam you may have never had a dream come on man that's a brittle spirit that is a brittle ass Spirit  that  is too much just grown ass woman you know what this  is like it's like coel Pro you know what that is it's a program that the FBI had under J gah hooa and this program one of the many things they did was they would track the sexual habits of anyone they considered an enemy of the state was a lip button that's why they got all these  sex takes with Martin Luther King   but lucky for us he actually had a drink you think if Lou CK jerked off in front of doctor can't be like I can't continue this movement I'm sorry but the freedom of black people must be stopped I didn't know this  was going to pull his dick out and jerk off like this I just thought we were going to get a couple of drinks and chill Show Business just harder than that them women sound like I hate to say y they sound weak I know it sounds  up I'm not supposed to say that but one of these ladies was like Lou c k was masturbating while I was on the phone with him  you don't know how to hang up phone how the  are you going to survive in Show Business If this is an actual obstacle to your dreams I know Louis is wrong ma'am I'm just saying I'm held to a higher standard of accountability than these women are don't forget who I am don't forget what I am I am a black dude and don't ever forget how I got here my ancestors were kidnapped I don't even know where the  I'm from they were put on the bottom of boats they sailed them across the Atlantic many of them died Only the strongest survived and once they got here they beat the human ity out of my people they turned us into Beast of burdens they made us do their work and the irony is hundreds of years later they called us lazy we fought in Civil War we damned near freed ourselves then in reconstruction black people did great my great-grandfather was a very wealthy man but then the black coats came Jim Crow came there was 100 years of unspeakable oppression again lynchings all kinds of terroristic acts to keep us in the margins of society yet we still fought and Dr King was born and then things got better 20 years after Dr King was assassinated Michael Jackson was Moon walking on television something something something Barack Obama Donald Trump and now here we all are 400 year nightmare took us 400 years to figure out as a people that white was weakness the whole time was kneeling during their national  anthem that's a brittle Spirit that's right  on the Rock it's reg ah what you doing  stand up the vice president of the United States got involved Mike Pence got involved he went to the game himself these  will have to stand when they see me and all them football players looked up in the stands and saw Mike Pence is that Mike Pence come on y'all woo tang bow  foiled brittle spirit I can kill every white prison in America at one time you know how I do it I would just wait for the Super Bowl right when they sang the national anthem I'd have OJ Simpson walk to the 50 yard line them bad knees is that OJ Simpson on the field what the hell is he doing here oh I know what he's going to do stop  him you got to man the  up y'all I don't mean to be disrespectful cuz man I know you're upset when I said but you know I know you I know you're right but come on baby it's me I was right once remember that does anybody remember when I was like missing from show business for 12 years remember when I had like this really popular show when I quit I remember I walked away from $50 million a lot harder than walking away from Louis freckled  dick I didn't know that I'd ever work again yeah here I am tonight did my dream die  no I remember that  you don't remember that when I quit my show on the way out the door I said something's wrong in Hollywood I believe they said I smoked crack that's right I remember remember they called me crazy so really you know you're right ladies congratulations enjoy it and they coming for you  they coming for you one person that's uncomfortable you know who's the most uncomfortable  in the room the  that's right I was rer than orgy once nobody  me I just walking around like Tom Cruz and the movie just looking and ruin the whole orgy by accident it's easier to ruin an orgy than you think all you got to do is wait for it to get kind of quiet and then go ew  I know I feel bad but I just feel like this is all happening for a reason and ladies I want you to win this fight 10 years ago I might have been scared but you know I got a daughter now so if you win she wins so I'm rooting for you and I agree with you at least ideologically I do I don't know if the I don't know if you're doing it just right but I mean who am I to say I I don't think you're wrong I just think that you can't make a lasting peace this way you got all the bad guys scared and that's good but the minute they not scared anymore it will get worse than it was before fear does not make lasting peace that's black people that's what it is what this city really needs uh without irony I'll say this the Kure for La is in South Africa you  need Truth and Reconciliation with one another because the end of a partti should have been a  bloodbath by any metric in human history and it wasn't and the only reason it wasn't is because Desmond Tutu and Mandela and all these guys figured out that if a system is corrupt then the people who adhere to the system and are incentivized by that system are not criminals they are victims and that the system itself must be tried but because the how systems work is so compartmentalized as far as information the only way we can figure out what the system is is if everybody says what they did tell them how you participated because men want to help they're just scared cuz Ben Affleck tried to help hey what happened to these ladies is discusting oh  you grab a titty of 95 all right fellas I'm out  that I ain't helping I just want to help I want to be a good guy like I can't even say the word me too anymore the  tonight was like Dave I'm going to the comedy club I was like I am also going to the comedy  club and I didn't even know what was happening but I guess I became like a

R I can't click on that come on  give me something I can click on dude get sucked off by a  little person I say to myself takes me hours to find one clip what the hell is this marginally groomed feminist enjoys consensual sex with vagu homosexual guy penis the same color as manine   click you notice a lot of black dudes having making me too I don't drinks myself you know why though obviously black women go through the same thing right the reason is because black women from slavery won't tell on us CU they know no matter how bad we black dudes are white dudes are very mean they scared to see us get punished my wife is Asian she telling me in a goddamn second a no  up in the Chappelle house and the wildest  about it is I live in Trump country I live amongst the ti torch whites poor

York you from where Manhattan Brooklyn you are from Brooklyn aren't you you look like you can rob somebody with a hammer  Brooklyn  rob you with  they find around the house I just got stabed with a toothbrush this  must be from Brooklyn I'm  around yeah man but you ladies are right be honest with you your lives look terrifying to me they do man I know nothing about being a woman but I know fear yo I used to live in New York when I was 17 and I couldn't even pay my bills you know what I did to make money I used to do shows for drug dealers that wanted to clean their money up one time I did a real good set and these  called me in the back room they gave me $25,000 in cash I was probably 18 to 19 years old I was scared I thanked them profusely I put that money in my backpack I jumped on the subway and started heading towards Brooklyn at 1:00 in the morning never been that terrified in my life because I never in my life had something that somebody else would want I thought to myself Jesus Christ if  knew how much money I had in this backpack they kill me for it then I thought holy  what if I had a  on me all the time that's what women are dealing with I'mma tell you right now it's real talk them same drug dealers gave me a  and said put this in your backpack and take it to Brooklyn I be like  I can't accept  this I empathize man you know everybody gets mad because I say these jokes but you understand that this is the best time to say them more now than ever and I know there some comedians in the back  you have a responsibility to speak recklessly otherwise my kids may never know what Reckless talk sounds like the joys of being wrong I didn't come here to be right just came here to  around it's hot in here suddenly isn't it wonder where that heat came  from I wonder what happened to me where did I go for 12 years if I wasn't raped maybe there's something else going on maybe these rapes aren't even the worst of it wouldn't that be something wouldn't that be something you can go ahead and go to the bathroom Brooklyn you don't need to hear this  you see that  right there he's under an enormous amount of pressure he is just being big and black with that head dude  your  is a suspect for everything except white collar crime  sometimes I wouldn't talk about where I went but y'all don't even want to know I was gone for a long time  I was in the upside down scary being a white dude now isn't it a little bit no well you're not going to get me too but you know what I mean it's funny for black dude see why people go through this because this is how it always is for us all my heroes is either murdered by the government or register sex offenders sad I know man but we've already been through it like Michael Jackson Remember When they said all that  about Michael Jackson they never proved anything till this dying day but they said that he did some very heinous things and one time I watched a documentary about it they were talking about all this  Michael Jackson allegedly did and as they were saying all these allegations he started showing pictures of his home the Neverland Ranch you ever seen Michael Jackson's house on television well the short of it is there's a lot of things for kids to do with that  place and I saw the whole thing exotic animals and Ferris wheels and marry go rounds and  and the more they showed it the more certain was that I I don't think Michael Jackson did any of those things they said he did house didn't look sexual it looked like he was flossing on those  didn't look like he was trying to  kids it looked like he's just trying to impress him like this nigga's Jay-Z for kids he just walking through his house this is my cotton candy machine it makes three tons of cotton candy day you know all the cotton candy you want this closet is filled with nothing but customade karate slippers isn't that cold shall I have my monkey bring us more  cupcakes hey guys this watching movie what movie do you want to see Home Alone Oh No No don't touch the DVD player M CK's here he can act it out come on M act out home alone for my guest and the kids was like man you are all all right mister this is fantastic man we had you all wrong H all wrong with I don't understand what you mean huh oh well you know man we thought it was going to be the usual you're going to have us come over and give us some wine cooler and you know suck our dicks what suck your oh you  ass kidsbody trying to suck your dick  I was trying to show you a better life bubbles get these kids the  out of my house you're just like everyone else Hollywood is no place for moral absolutism you know what I mean we must never forget that our Kelly peed on a 15-year-old girl and he also wrote I believe I can fly same guy same lifetime  if I showed you that video of him peeing on that girl and scored to I Believe I Can Fly it'd be torn I used to think that I could not go on you would know how to feel if I can see it it's okay my career ended many years ago   order no I'm terrible I'm terrible I'm sorry everybody I'm sorry you want to know what happened to me it's tempting but I don't want to talk about maybe at the end when I run out of things to talk about actually I'm almost there I'm just trying to tell you what happened to me was not it I just didn't have a good go of it what I don't know what you guys think happens when you quit a successful show like this I'll tell you what doesn't happen they don't go hey well good luck with your future endeavors that's not what happens it was cold out there for real I had to watch it all go down without me I had to watch all those people do my show ke and Peele and am schuma and mind Mia well I'm not going to say they were doing my show I'm just saying they were awfully similar I was mad and people would come up to me on the street and be like yo  every once in a while most people thought I was crazy but sometimes people come yo  you did the right thing man you my hero  I don't want to be your hero I want to be rich never choose to be a hero cuz Heroes die uncomfortable deaths all I wanted to be was Paul reveal I just needed one heroic moment you understand pv's ride was only one night and then 40 Years of him being like hey y'all remember that time everybody was asleep and I was up in the British was coming boy it's a good thing I was awake  everybody be there  that's why I want to start a gofund me for calling kaic I do man I'm fascinated with him I want to make sure he never has to play football again he can't if he wants to I just don't want him to have to cuz why the  not I know he's rich and people would be like I'm not giving a go fund me to a rich dude but you should you should because that motherfucker's life was going great he's so light-skinned he didn't even have to say he was black and yet he took a KNE during that anthem for us thought about us when things were going good when his belly was full when he was he didn't think about his livelihood or any of that and they took his livelihood away from him I'm like man that shouldn't be the way it is every  person that takes a stand for somebody else always gets beat down and we watch it over and over and over again we watch it but we should pay those  for blowing a whistle because they make our lives better and we could change the narrative we could make one  have a good outcome for doing the right thing and that would make another  be brave enough to do the right thing and if you did that then  like Harvey Weinstein wouldn't raped for 40 years cuz  want a stupid ass partner we should take care of each other wouldn't be nice to be like remember that time they was going to kill Jesus but then he got all that money  Real Talk man it's not a racial thing it's about us making our society better it's about like even these women that are coming forward and they will say they're Brave and and many of them are and a few of them a few of them suck the dick and got buyers remorse that's a huge Omission from this narrative this wouldn't have gone this far and some women weren't willing to do it you can't ask every woman to hold the line some women can carry things heavier than others so we should fight for one another we should forgive the ones of us that are weaker and support the ones with us that are stronger and then we can beat the thing you guys keep going after individuals the system is going to stay in attack you have to have men on your side and I'm telling you right now you're going to have a lot of imperfect allies I'll tell you what happened but I can't say it directly there's a book to me that encapsulates my entire experience before I left the show and the book is called pimp it's written by a guy named Iceberg Slim here bring it up here this is Matthew Matthew is from France he's white and yet he has an original copy of this book written by a black American who was a pimp in the 40s Iceberg Slim his real name was Robert Beck he got the name Iceberg because he was in a bar in Chicago and there was a shootout in the bar and a bullet went through this nigga's hat and he still finished his drink pimps love  like that they said man you ice cold and he said I like that and it stuck this spook is so heavy in the front it has a glossery of pimp terms because the ideas are so foreign to the American ears for instance do you know what the phrase mileage on a ho  means of course you don't mileage on a whole is a very wild concept it means that pimps understand there's a finite amount of bad  A person can do before they'll lose their  mind and a good pimp can look at a woman that he's never seen before and call it she's good for 500  that's her mileage anything over that that  is going to spill they do it to you why the  you think most of us work from 9 to 5 9 to6 might kill a  Iceberg Slim was the one that broke down what a bottom  was does anyone know what a bottom  is anyone what's the bottom  sir it's your uh it's your prostitute that's the best out of all of them that brings in the most money that's right that's exactly right are you black that's right a bottom  is A Pimp's number one ho she's even a  that helps him keep the other  in line I will repeat she's even the  that helps him keep the other  in line the pimp was McDonald's and the bottom  is french fries the rest of them  like fish sandwiches cherry pies and  like  that Iceberg Slim breaks down some of the coldest capitalist Concepts I've ever heard in my life he describes in detail how these men break women so that they will give them the money that they make with their own bodies there's a story in here so cold it makes me shutter to think about it Iceberg Slim is trying to control the woman that he finds uncontrollable so he ask older pimp how it can rain her in and the older pimp says oh that's easy Iceberg all you have to do is beat that  with a coat hanger and then run her a bath and give her some pills she'll be so grateful that you fixed her that she'll forget you were the  that beat her in the first place that's some cold  now the End of This Book Iceberg Slim tells the story it's kind of the crescendo of the book and in the story Iceberg Slim's bottom  is at the end of a mileage if she was good for 500  she was at$ 4.98 she was bubbling you could see it she was going crazy she started saying all kinds of  oh I always wanted to be in Circus Circus is  is do I can juggle too you know juggle he had to let it go it's hard to let a go a bottom  go and he wasn't ready to let it go because his organization couldn't handle losing her but she didn't know that she didn't know how important she was so what he did was he called her to a Nina he said look  you and I got a part ways she said fine  I don't need you anyway because I know somebody in wringling Brothers she's like all right  whatever I got one last trick for you it's a big money trick you do this for me you get paid I get paid and we go our separate ways he said  what do you want me to do he said okay there's a guy in that hotel across the street he waiting for you in room number seven when she go over there and I want you to  him but before you do I need you to put some of this stuff in his drink then he's going to fall asleep when he does there's briefcase on his bed bring the briefcase to me that's the trick  can you handle it she said  yeah I can handle it I can't wait to get rid of you and she ran outside jumped on the unicycle and pedal across the street an iceberg washed her he's like man she's pretty good man if I never jerked off in the face maybe she would have been in the circus right now she runs up to the motel steps and she disappears in the room number seven she's gone for a real long time real long time so long in fact that Iceberg got a little worried but then suddenly she came back he said what's going on  where's the briefcase she said I didn't get it Daddy he said what do you mean you didn't get the briefcase  what's wrong with you she said I did everything you said but but that man don't look right something wrong Daddy what do you mean something's wrong  did you put that stuff in his drink she said I did everything you said Daddy I put all of it in his drink he said wait a minute  wait a minute you put all of it in his drink now he had to see for himself so the two of them go across the street to the motel and they go into room number seven and on the bed laying lifelessly is the white man that she was supposed to  and I say you right  she don't look good what the  so he called a friend of his that was a doctor that was close by and the doctor came in gave the guy a thorough examination and told them both what was obvious slim this  is dead oh god daddy oh no oh no we killed him he said calm down  we didn't do anything you killed this  and then he reached on the bed and he grabbed the briefcase he popped it open it was filled with money more money than any of them ever seen nesburg took a little bit of the money and gave it to the doctor and the doctor left discreetly all right  let me think I can fix this for you I know somebody I can call but if I call him I'mma owe these  a big favor oh god daddy please I don't want to go to jail neither do I  so you shut up she picked up the phone she heard him mumbling in the phone a little bit he hung up the phone and she was pacing the room and he was just standing there cool and they were waiting and they were waiting and suddenly A van pulled up downstairs two guys get out with a carpet they walk upstairs they roll that carpet out on the floor they throw the body in the carpet they roll that  up like a burrito they pick that  up and they throw it in the back of the van they come back up and Iceberg opens the briefcase again and gives them a little money he says I'll get in touch with you guys later they said you're not going to get in touch with us at all we'll find you he said whatever  and they bounced oh god daddy oh God just relax  listen we getting the  out of here you go downstairs you get the car we got to leave separately she went she got the car Iceberg grabbed that briefcase waited a few minutes looked out the window and then he went down with her they both got in the car and they drove off she was a blubbering mess oh oh we did all this  he said I told you  we didn't do anything you killed a  and I cleaned him up and now we got that's a secret okay I know I'm not going to tell  it's you said oh no I ain't going to tell he said all right baby cool I'm G need you to stay with me for a while after this  cools down she goes okay okay okay that's the game that's how the whole  Works ladies you understand this  was at the end of a mileage she was at 498 she ended up tricking for Iceberg for another 6 months she must have turned another 200 tricks for him do you understand that's some cold  and the cold  about it is that the dead guy on the bed wasn't even dead at all this  was just a friend of icebergs acting like he's sleep the doctor wasn't a doctor it was a  butcher that happened to have a white coat and the dudes who came in the moving van clothes was dressed like movers because they were movers Iceberg had gotten a new  apartment and the bag of money was icebergs money in the first place the money he got from all those women that's a cold game that's the  capet's Manifesto and that's why I went to South Africa so now we got us a little secret  you know when I was growing up probably about 8 years old and at the time we were living in Silver Spring yeah yeah yes common misconception about me in DC a lot of people think I'm from the hood that's not true but I never bothered to correct anybody because I wanted the streets to embrace me as a matter of fact I I kept it up as a ruse like sometimes I'll hang out with rappers like Nas and them and these  start talking about the projects yo it was wild in the PJs yo and I'll be like word  word but I don't know I have no idea my parents did just well enough so that I could grow up poor around white people and to be honest when Nas and them talk about the projects  I used to get jealous because it sounded fun everybody in the projects was poor that's fair but if you were pouring Silver Spring  it felt like it was only happening to you I know the pain of that first sleepover at a white friend's house and you come back home on Sunday and just look at your parents like y'all need to step your game up everything in Timmy's house works remember the first time you saw that the cold winter and you be at a white friend's house and see the  in their living room without their coats on Timmy was one of my first White friends like in my life man he good dude too he moved to Silver Spring from Utah of all places I guess his family was affiliated with that Mormon church they got down there and me and him used to hang out and one day I was at his house we just hanging out and Timmy says Dave why don't you stay for dinner tonight I said oh man I'd love to but I can't if I'm not home before dark my mother will kill me that was a lie my mother had several jobs I hadn't seen her like 3 or 4 days that point in my life it was my experience that white dinner wasn't delicious I'd rather go home and fry some baloney or some  like that but then Old Timmy threw me a curve ball I wasn't expecting he said oh it's too bad you can't stay Dave cuz um Mom uh made stove top stuffing I said what the  stove top well hold on  let me make some phone calls real quick I had seen that commercial so many times I had dreamt of getting my hands on some of that stove top stuff and finally I met a  that actually had a box of stove top in the house I couldn't miss this opportunity so I pretended to call my mother and then I came back in I said Timmy Timmy you're not going to believe this great news mom said I can stay he said fantastic he said why don't you come with me and we'll help set the table and then we can save the blessing I had no interest in setting this motherfucker's table or saying these crazy ass Mormon prayers I just wanted that God damn stuffing my hands first my plan was simple wash my hands slowly and by the time I'm done the table will be set the blessing will be said and all that there will be left to do do is he do went to the bathroom I washed my hands very slowly I must have been in there for about 10 minutes and suddenly one of his mothers came to the  door she was like hi David right I said yes ma'am she said Timmy tells me that you're planning on staying for dinner I said I hope that's not a problem ma'am she says no it's no problem in fact we love to have you it's just that we weren't expecting company and I'm afraid there's not enough stov top stuffing for everybody so I kicked her in the  bam ladies and gentlemen I told you I'm dope  I told you I was going to say and you still didn't see it coming and that's why I make the big  bocks oh my God but there's a more important reason that I would stop doing comedy right now and this reason is the real reason that's been percolating and and it really is the crowd not you I'm talking about the crowd on the big stage it's too hard to entertain a country whose ears are so brittle  are so sensitive the whole country is turned into  ass   everything you say upset somebody you know I can remember when it all started it was when I was doing Chappelle Show when I was doing Chappelle Show I used to do the show and then on the weekends I do like concerts and  like that so I'm doing a concert and there was a couple in the front row beautiful couple the wife wife is obviously Asian you can see it in her face the husband this  was mysterious to say the least couldn't quite pinpoint where he was from caramel colored fell very nice hair but it could have been from anywhere Bangladesh Mexico I can't guess what a niggaer like this all I knew for sure about this guy is that his wife was a  I could see that in her face too no he was laughing and having a good time and she was scowling at me at a goddamn comedy show I couldn't figure it out and then I realized at some point that she was pregnant and I was smoking on stage I said oh my God that's probably why she's mad so I started to put my cigarette out but then she hit me with one of them fake non-smoker CS so I just kept smoking I thought to myself  that baby will be fine relax and I tried to break the tension I just asked her that's all I said I go hey where you guys from anyway and I could tell that she was on to me she goes very condescendingly she says I'm from California if you asking my ethnicity I am chin he was like I'm Mexican bro I said well I'm sorry if I offended you by asking but you're a very beautiful couple and Miss there's no question that you're going to give birth to the hardest working baby this world has ever seen  that's not a bad joke she got very upset she got up to leave immediately but she didn't just leave she had to take one last dig at me on the way out I will never buy one of your  DVDs again Dave Chappelle I said ma'am with all due respect Chinese people don't buy D days and the crowd went crazy we've all laughing having a good time I didn't even think anything of it and then just 3 days later this lady sends a  letter to my promoter telling him not to book me for shows anymore because I was quote racist huh and and I'm quoting her insensitive to the nature of my interracial marriage I was like word  I was if she she would know that I myself am in an interracial marriage that's right in fact my wife is Asian too surprise  I'll see you on Thanksgiving but my wife's not Chinese she's Filipino that's right that's right and our kids are Puerto Rican somehow so there you go I don't give a  about interracial in fact you know what my mother is half white a lot of people don't know that all right you were a little too excited but okay a lot of people don't believe me when I say that but it's true you can't tell looking at me but if I grew my hair out you would think he was at a  Cat Williams concert my  is my  is beautiful hello for spe   that didn't thr you  don't here that be good a lot   here have  yeah like to do  still they took though   right theye  yeah it's  about D here man foree  speee for  spee let this say like though yeah  fore  speech don't  they hand man H that foree   byebye "

table and then we can say the blessing I had no interest in setting this motherfucker's table of saying these crazy ass Mormon prayers I just wanted a goddamn stuffing my hands first my plan was simple wash my hands slowly and by the time I'm done the table will be set the blessing will be said and all that there will be left to do is eat went to the bathroom I wash my hands very slowly I must have been in there for about 10 minutes and suddenly one of his mothers came to the door  she was like hi David right I said yes ma'am she said Timmy tells me that you're planning on staying for dinner I said I hope that's not a problem ma'am she says no it's no problem in fact we'd love to have you it's just that we weren't expecting company and I'm afraid there's not enough stove top stuffing for everybody foreign so I kicked her in the  gentlemen  y'all didn't see it coming and that's why I make the big bucks  oh my God but there's more important reason that I would stop doing comedy right now and this reason is the real reason that's been percolating and it really is the crowd not you I'm talking about the crowd on the big stage it's too hard to entertain a country whose ears are so brittle  are so sensitive the whole country has turned into  ass  everything you say upsets somebody you know I can remember when it all started it was when I was doing Chappelle Show when I was doing Chappelle Show I used to do the show and then on the weekends I do like concerts and  like that so I'm doing a concert and there was a couple in the front row beautiful couple the wife was obviously Asian you can see it in her face the husband this  was mysterious to say the least couldn't quite pinpoint where he was from caramel colored fella very nice hair but it could have been from anywhere Bangladesh Mexico I can't guess with a  like this all I knew for sure about this guy is that his wife was a  I could see that in her face too no he was laughing and having a good time and she was scowling at me at a goddamn comedy show I couldn't figure it out and then I realized at some point that she was pregnant and I was smoking on stage I said oh my God that's probably why she's mad so I started to put my cigarette out but then she hit me with one of them fake non-smoker calls so I just kept smoking I thought to myself  that baby would be fine relax and I tried to break the tension I just asked her that's all I said I go hey where you guys from anyway and I could tell that she was on to me she goes very condescendingly she says I'm from California if you're asking my ethnicity I am childhood he was like a Mexican bro I said well I'm sorry if I offended you by asking but you're a very beautiful couple and Miss there's no question that you're going to give birth to the hardest working baby this world has ever seen that's not a bad joke she got very upset she got up to leave immediately but she didn't just leave she had to take one last dig of me on the way out I will never buy one of your  DVDs again Dave Chappelle I said ma'am with all due respect Chinese people don't buy DVDs  and the crowd went crazy we've all laughed and having a good time I didn't even think anything of it and then just three days later this lady sends a  letter to my promoter telling him not to book me for shows anymore because I was quote racist huh and and I'm quoting her insensitive to the nature of my interracial marriage I was like word  I was if she she would know that I myself am in an interracial marriage that's right in fact my wife is Asian too surprise  I'll see you on Thanksgiving  but my wife's not Chinese she's Filipino that's right that's right and our kids are Puerto Rican somehow so there you go I don't give a  about interracial man in fact you know what my mother is half white a lot of people don't know that well right you were a little too excited but okay  a lot of people don't believe me when I say that but it's true you can't tell looking at me but if I grew my hair out you would think you was at a  Katt Williams concert my shoes my  is beautiful  are just taking it too far I don't know why or how everybody got this goddamn sensitive you know who hates me the most the transgender community yeah oh yeah these  I mean I didn't realize how bad it was these  I was really mad about that last Netflix special thank you it's tough man I don't know what to do about it because because I like them I always have never had a problem you know just  around as a matter of fact I think I make fun of everybody and I mean there's a group of people that have to admit it's kind of  hilarious man I'm sorry bro I was like I've never seen somebody in such a hilarious predicament not have a sense of humor about it they're born feeling like there's something other than they're born as and that's kind of funny you know like I mean it's funny if it's not happening to you it's like that white black  that's in the news all the time Rachel Dozer he's a white woman but then she dressed up like a  shot her way up to the very top of Blackness and I always wanted to meet her just so I could understand I just wanted to like have dinner with her so I could just look in her eyes and call her a  to her face  the father I identify black that is trans talk lady stop biting stop biting it's a big difference between her and a trans the difference between her and the trans is I believe transgenders I don't understand them either but I know they mean what they say them  cut they dicksaw that's all the proof I need I've never seen somebody just throw their dick away don't need it  I don't understand but I believe you when I support your decision  how far is Rachel willing to go hmm what is racial willing to do so that we blacks can believe that she believes she's actually one of us  are you willing to put a lien on your house invest in a mixtape that probably won't work out  she didn't even change her name didn't even change her name her name is Rachel I can't believe in that name you want my support you're gonna have to change your name to the blackest  I've ever heard but you're gonna have to change your name but Draymond Green  I don't know a blacker name than that this  is black on paper if you type Draymond Green in the Airbnb that  will log off automatically  when people get mad bro people get mad about everything I say I was doing a show I was in Portland Oregon and I was checked in a hotel under the name Charles Edward cheese I came back and there was a a no it was like a letter on my desk it was addressed to Mr Cheese so obviously I'm going to assume that whoever wrote this letter must be an intimate friend of mine it's not some kind of name that a person would just guess but then I opened a letter and it turns out I don't know this person at all it's a fan letter you know I'm not even used to the idea that I have fans but I'm grateful for it and uh and even though I I'm grateful for fans I I don't read those letters be nice if I did but realistically it's like what am I Santa Claus Nick I don't have time for this like got  I want to do I'm trying to chill read all these dreams and wishes from strangers but then but I read it I'd already opened it so I just read the whole letter and you know what man whoever wrote this letter truly loves me I mean they were really  nice in the letter and then they described to me what it was like to come to the show how excited they were how much fun they were having and then they said that when I got to my jokes about transgenders that they were quote devastated because it turns out that whoever wrote the letter was transgender now I'm going to be real for a second gotta understand I never feel bad about anything I say up here and I I would never admit this to you if I hadn't locked your phones up  but it was the weirdest thing like when I read this letter at the  made me feel bad I didn't feel bad about what I said you understand I felt bad that I made somebody else feel bad to be honest I don't even know what I said that upset that person I have so many transgender jokes but I feel like I feel like it was probably this joke I'm about to tell you right now and it's not a joke it's a true joke I mean it's not true but I I had read in the paper that Caitlyn and Jenna was contemplating posing nude in an upcoming issue of Sports Illustrated and I know it's not politically correct to say these things so I just freaking  it I'll say it for everybody else yuck oh sometimes I just want to read some stats I don't know why he's going to cram some man  in the middle of the sports page like this I just didn't think that was the place for it but I wasn't saying anything like Caitlyn Jenner's a bad person I'm not mad at her for doing it not even made it supposed to Illustrated if I'm mad at somebody I'm probably just mad at myself you understand stay down I know that I am not strong enough to not look at those pictures and I don't think I'm ready to see what she's trying to show me so Caitlyn goddamn if you go through with this thing  you better go hard or go home I want you to go all the way Hospital style do you know what hustle style means miss that means spread the lips  how she surprised that lives in this itty bitty dick inside  the show is behind the curtains  I don't know what I said that upset that person but I'm going to tell you something when I read that letter in the moments after I read it I did something that many black men in America do not have the time or the money to do I thought about how I felt I asked myself a very basic question I don't think I ever directly contemplated I said man Dave if you're writing all these jokes do you have a problem with transgender people and the answer is absolutely not the  do you guys think I am I don't understand all the choices that people make but I do understand that life is hard and that those types of choices do not disqualify you from a life with dignity and happiness and safety in it but if I'm honest  my problem has never been with transgender people my problem is transgender people I just feel like these things should not be discussed in front of the blacks it's  insulting all this talk about how these people feel inside since when is America giving a  how any of us see you inside and I cannot shake this awful suspicion that the only reason everybody is talking about transgenders is because white men want to do it that's right I just said that if it was just women that felt that way or black dudes and Mexican dudes being like Hey Y'all we feel like girls inside they'd be like shut up  no one has how you felt come on everybody we have strawberries to pick it reeks of white privilege you never asked yourself why it was easier for Bruce Jenner to change his gender than it was for Cassius Clay to change his  name and if I were to be brutally honest the only reason I ever been mad at the transgender Community is because I was at these  with six songs straight I had no idea and then the lights came up and I saw them knuckles I said oh no and everybody was laughing at me high world stopped  I said why didn't you say anything then I heard that sultry voice I didn't say anything Dave Chappelle because I was having a wonderful time and I wasn't sure how you'd feel about it I said you knew how I feel and she said I'm going home I don't want any trouble from you I said home it's only two songs left I mean we might as well finish tonight and we ended up having breakfast together I'll grow up that doesn't make me gay I just Terry  up instead is as real as any teddies in LA it's two o'clock in the morning I was just borrowing a little friction from a stranger who oops it's the madness abuse types of mistakes the man makes when he's young I wouldn't know that it's necessarily a mistake it was a wild Night Out but I don't do it like that anymore I'm oh I'm 44 now hey it's the first time in my life I've ever like started to physically feel my age you can it's tough man you know how I'm getting old this is embarrassing but I was in my hotel room I was I'm not gonna lie I was jerking off like and I was like really sweating it out and this one I knew I was old I just gave up in the middle like nothing even happened  like I don't like looking at my dick anymore my dick looks extinguished it's oh the old looking dick he's got salt and pepper hair all around it my dick looks like Morgan Freeman in the 90s without the dots my dick narrates and Dave pulled me out and started jerking me around and jerking me around but not with the same vicas when he was young he and I both knew nothing was coming out I see my age and my children I came home from the road this is not long ago I've been gone for a vegan picture I was gone for weeks and weeks and when I came back uh nobody was home not one person in my family thought that the uh maybe I'd like to see them when I got back like they knew when I was coming back but they just weren't they just weren't home and that  it was a wake-up call you know like when my kids were little and the two of us would pull up to the house these  would spill out is home hooray and they'd hug me and kiss me and then as the years went on they'd get less interested hey everybody look it's Mr promises back from the road but empty house that's some cold  I went into my oldest son's room I was like hello hello he was gone and I never done this thing before but for some reason I just did it I just I just looked through his  just to see who this  was becoming and I found these notebooks and I started going through the notebooks and it was all this wonderful poetry in them written as his handwriting I didn't even notice  wrote poems laughs and then I looked through his drawers and I opened up his middle drawer and I found this rolling paper when I looked down at them papers like oh that's where that poetry is coming from  and that  broke my heart I mean I smoke weed but I mourned my son's innocence and I cried a little bit and I took his papers upstairs in my room roll with some weed that I'd hid from the family and I got really high and then I got paranoid so I put his papers back how I found them so he wouldn't know what I was up to snake won't even know that that happened until he sees his special and  I found your papers he's a cold  let me tell you this kid is only 16 years old listen what he did to me so  calls me up in the middle of the night it was one o'clock in the morning he goes Dad don't be mad I knew something was terribly wrong I said what's going on he said listen I'm fine and don't forget you told me to do this I'm in a party and my designated driver had too much to drink and me and my friends need to come pick us up I said Jesus Christ it's one o'clock in the morning  I am shit-faced  foreign  than some kid I might as well roll the dice and go pick my  up I said all right I'm coming to get you just give me the address and I'll be right there and he gave me the address and I was I was shocked I said Son you are not gonna believe this but I'm at the same party  they grow fast can I ask you a weird question I want to make you feel uncomfortable you don't have to answer it and if it doesn't go well we'll just edit it out anyway is it weird to be the only white people in a row I mean you could be honest because it feels strange are you worried at all Give Me Your Money  this guy got eyes in his veins he didn't even buckle you know like many black men my age the first time I voted was eight years ago right I saw Obama on TV I said oh I'm voting for this  I remember the day I voted for Obama I voted in Ohio and my vote matters in Ohio Ohio is a Battleground state but when I pulled up through the polls all the soldiers were in line there were so many black people in that goddamn line I didn't even know it was supposed I thought it was a check cashing place   we were hugging each other and old people were singing hymns and spirituals okay verdict times 10 or some  I've never seen black people that happen eight years later I'm pulling up to the polls again this time I'm driving a brand new Porsche because the Obama years were very good to me I was early voted and when I parked my car I figured out something that it would take the rest of the country another week to figure out I understood that Donald Trump was going to be our next president because in Ohio unlike D.C you could see the results in the parking lot it's all these goddamn pickup trucks and tractors and  and then I walked up and I saw a long long line of Dusty white people  yes ladies and gentlemen these were the poor whites I must tell you I've never had a problem with white people ever in my life but full disclosure we've got a lot of trouble out of them and I've never seen so many of them up close they're looking right in their cold smeared faces and to my surprise you know what I didn't see I didn't see one deplorable face in that group I saw some angry faces and some determined faces but they felt like decent Folk no they did in fact I'm not even mine and I didn't sound  up but I felt sorry for him I know the game now I know that rich white people call Poor white people trash and the only reason I know that is because I made so much money last year the rich whites told me they say it in the cocktail Park and I'm not with that  and I stood with them in line like all of us Americans required doing a democracy nobody skips the line to vote and I listen to them I listened to them say naive poor white people things man Donald Trump's gonna go to Washington and he's going to stand in my mind you dumb  thank you  are poor he's fighting for me and they all looked at me they could tell who I was voting for just as easily as I could tell who they were voting for but do you guys know we all had in common not one of us not a single one of us looked like we felt good about what we had to do in that boost we were just doing our goddamn Duty yes I voted for Hillary Clinton of course I did I voted for her because I liked what she said vastly better than I liked what he said but to be honest with you at that point that she was like watching Darth Vader do that I have a dream speech that  is mean as hell she'd already Karate Kid swept Bernie Sanders legs from underneath him boy it was hard voting for that  but that it was the Lester of the evils I know you were Clinton supporter Miss I am sorry for her but it didn't feel as good as it should have she was gonna be our first woman president they want to make coins out of this  and somehow she just missed the dunk of course he should have beat him of course he should have beat him you know voting for her felt like it was bittersweet it felt like I was lucky enough to eat Halle Berry's  and whilst I was doing so she  farted in my face man  and you understand I'd still do it but boy I wish she didn't fart in this great nation's face I voted that day and then that same day I flew to New York City at work that night I was in a comedy club in New York and I said to an audience almost exactly what I just said to you and I didn't know that there was a journalist in the room and this journalist wrote an article the headline of the article said Dave Chappelle is an avid yeah I had no idea the paper said that you know how I found out my wife called me from Ohio the next morning in a goddamn panic David David what the  is going on in New York I said I'm being good but what have you heard  my wife said the paper is saying that you're a Donald Trump supporter I was like  I said don't worry about that  baby nobody in their right mind would believe that and she said no David people believe it and then she started reading the comments to me oh they were terrible all these black people call me all kinds of Uncle Toms and  I should tell you but this is a very serious allegation from one black to another  I was incensed Uncle Tom how my Uncle Tom  you don't one that reads the Observer anyway all this  goes down around and now Trump is the president and I'm hosting Saturday Night Live and I didn't really like preparing my monologue I just kind of winged it and at the end of the monologue I don't even remember what I said I said something like you know  it like we'll uh historically disenfranchise and we're gonna give him something about we're going to give them a chance if he gives us a chance I don't know what I said but whatever I said I I really wish I didn't say that  it's not worth the trouble now walking to the barbershop and all them black people just be looking at me like yo Dave what's up with your boy yo  it's not my boy because I don't care if you're a Republican or Democrat if you support them or not any objective person is going to have to admit that uh this  is having a terrible go with it it really is we've had presidents before that have done bad jobs but this  is worse than a bad child it's scary to watch holy  it's like seeing a crack pipe and your Uber drivers passengers  lunch I watched I watched Donald Trump in a press conference and this  had all the media together and this  literally literally asked the media to their face to stop finding  out I was like yo yo this  is bugging and then I'm not even making this up his lips started sweating his lips have you ever seen a  lip sweat what the  is wrong with this nigga's lips it's like if you're on a plane right you've been on a plane and like I get scared to fly I do it all the time I'll be scared on there and sometimes the plane will hit turbulence and then I get nervous but I always look at the flight attendant and she looks calm and it makes me feel calm but if that bitch's lips were sweating   and then I'm not even making a chef this  grab the problem he goes Gary the things I read in my briefings are what's that bro that's bad leadership even as a parent you think I'm gonna sit my kids there hey little man come here real quick for a second yeah I'm three months behind on the rent  and I am worried very worried don't go to school and have a productive day  I was just thinking out loud getting some  off my chest like what the  are you doing bro it's bad man Jesus Christ all this motherfucker's ideas sound like High people ideas but he doesn't think these things through before he tells us he just tells us what he's thinking as soon as it occurs to him it  sounds nuts oh I'm gonna go to China and I'm gonna get those jobs from China and bring them back here to America for what  so iPhones can be nine thousand dollars leave that job and China where it belongs none of us want to work that hard the  is he thinking because I don't want to make them shits what the  are you doing stop trying to give us Chinese jobs I am going to bring back coal Coal  cold drink in my life even seen a  lump of coal I honestly don't even know what coal is for if you're gonna have  digging around in the dirt looking for  find me some truffles  that's what I'm about and these travel prices are getting out of control if it gets any worse I'm gonna be back down to regular butter like everybody else terrible terrible job this  hit North Korea with rap battle threats fire and fury like yo yo what are you doing   Korea man Kim Jong-un is a scary  he's he might be as crazy as Trump scary  and if he wanted them naive  and thinks that a war with Korea is going to be easy then you don't play Call of Duty at 3am like I do because that's when the Koreans play  eight-year-old Korean kid took out my whole goddamn platoon last night  I've never seen somebody in the office so high with the most just basic  Solutions like you know not let any more Muslims in the country till we can figure out what's going on did he just say figure out what's going on who doesn't know how to do basic math let's count it out okay it's been 17 mass shootings in the United States four of them were done by Muslims none of those four Muslims were from any of the seven countries in your stupid ass original band and since he bought it up the other 13 shootings were done by the tiki torch whites these are facts he don't see me trying to ban white people from the show to keep some  terrible idea because it's mean and it's racist and most importantly it would be catastrophic to my bottom line if there were no white people here tonight I might leave this  with eighteen hundred dollars this man needs to realize that we all need each other and that's why we will never ever be able to beat China because everybody in America is racist and everybody in China's Chinese this  called it all wrong and don't believe the media either because as all this  is happening the media is trying to make us believe that the extremities amongst us are the Norms we can disagree that's fine and most of us are keeping a cool head about this  you know what I mean Americans generally respect one another's beliefs even if they don't share those beliefs I know I do I respect everybody's beliefs except Amish people because they are the only ones that I can say clearly their God is wrong miles an hour in Ohio and one lane of traffic is buggy  your God it's ridiculous all the Amish people around my way know me too not from television obviously they know me from the streets because when I see them  and buckets I pull the Porsche over and talk to him Ezekiel Ezekiel are you sure that God doesn't want you to have any of this technology or this energy huh huh I can't hear you  let me turn this air conditioner off what did you say  be like get away from me yee ye tried to tempt me like the devil devil nah bro I'm trying to put you on to the game Zeke Big World out here  I just went 25 miles in 30 minutes that's a Day's Journey for you you don't even know what the weather's going to be tomorrow do you I do you don't even know that there's a valuable Pokemon right on here I drive away  huh oh my vape pen you want to hit my vape pen oh sorry  I'm trying not to get herpes my bad I've been playing cat and mouse with herpes for 30 years now but every night I go to the club I'll be like not tonight Herbie no disrespect I'm not saying you have herpes I'm just saying one out of five people do so let's just uh let's just all be careful around this  make sure that the we leave with the lips we came with  sometimes I think that the media is hard on Trump because I see  that they get on them about that doesn't seem bad to me I mean  got on Trump about not staying in the White House enough gives a  this  was rich used to  in a gold toilet true I don't know if you've ever been to the white house it looks like a very nice place to work but I wouldn't want to live in that Scooby-Doo ass house either that's just terrifying looking imagine you trying to jerk off   Bush didn't stay there either he was rich too he was like  that I'm going to my Ranch in Texas Obama was the first  to move into the White House like this is a nice place look at this rug foreign about putting Jared Kushner in his cabinet and I didn't think that that was the worst thing he'd done and he was still early and I mean it's not unprecedented Kennedy had his brother's attorney general right  are washing and Outsider to be honest with you I'd probably do the same thing as a matter of fact I do you think I go to a Hollywood meeting with all them white folks by myself I bring my  Mac Mittens from the streets I don't even know his real name everybody just calls him Mac mittens but I know he's not he's not qualified to even listen to these meetings but this  just makes me feel good and all the white people look at me like Dave do you mind asking your friend Mac mittens to excuse us so that we can talk business and I say  that anything you say he listened to the whole meeting when they done talking I just look over at Mac mittens and if he gives me the signal meow meow foreign the papers it's a gut check or how about this one remember when uh it was the day after the election and the president of Taiwan called Donald Trump to congratulate him and Donald Trump you know of course took the call and talked to the president of Taiwan problem with that was uh Taiwan doesn't have a president the United States functions on what they called a one China policy and Taiwan is a renegade province of said China and Donald Trump didn't know that and picked up the phone and started yammering away and the media ate his ass up and I'm not gonna lie I was laughing like  I was like oh she's in trouble  and then that night I was in bed drifting off to sleep and then I had to admit it to myself I was like I didn't know that  either  and then I realized the media got the story wrong the story wasn't that Donald Trump took the whole body told Donald Trump not to take the call that's terrifying God damn  you don't have a Mac mittens on your team it's one like they were calling the White House they were calling the switchboard the Trump Towers and they were getting through anybody Mr President there's a Ricky Dicky Tabby on the phone for you yes yes put him through hello hello Ricky Dicky good to talk to you Mr President there's a John Jacob Jingleheimer Smith on the phone his name is my name too put him through hello hello John Jacob let's talk business  how many people in this room are not originally from the United States my Round of Applause where are you from bro you right there you're from Iraq I was  around how long you been here in the country 23 years are you a citizen yet you are congratulations thank you congratulations well welcome to this great land you know I'm going to give you a history lesson because I'm sure this wasn't on your entry exam but every naturalized American has heard something about what I'm about to tell you a picture is the early 50s in the United States it's a 14 year old boy goes down from Chicago to Mississippi to meet his extended family for the first time he'd never been to Mississippi and before he went his mother said to him very pointedly she said if a white man looks you in your eyes in Mississippi look away and I don't know what you know about black people from Chicago but they're not a scared people imagine has it he was in front of a convenience store hanging a woman walked out of the store and he thought she was pretty and he said bye baby not realizing that he had just made a fatal mistake four days later four days later a group of adult white men person to this family's home and snatched a 14 year old boy out of bed in front of his family that was powerless to stop them and he was never seen alive again his name was Emmett Till they found his body maybe a few days later it was in a creek tied to a wheel so it would sink horribly beaten and Bloated hideous and lucky for everybody in America his mother was a  gangster she was if you can imagine in the very midst of a mother's worst nightmare this woman had the foresight to think about everybody said leave my son's casket open she said the world needs to see what they did to my baby and every publication here in the United times had this boy's horribly bloated body on its cover and if I was Civil Rights Movement was a car this boy's dead body was premium gas this was a very definitive moment in American history where every thinking and feeling person was like Ugh we got to do better than this and they fought beautifully and here we all are and and the reason that I bring that up tonight and why it's relevant now is because less than a year ago the woman that he allegedly whistled at admitted on her deathbed that she lied in her Court testimony and you can imagine when we read that  we was like oh you lying ass  was Furious but that was my initial reaction and initial reactions that we all learned as we get older are often wrong or more often incomplete they call this phenomenon standing too close to an elephant the analogy being that if you stand too close to an elephant you can't see the elephant all you see is its penis like skin and give it a better look and on stepping back and thinking about it for a few moments I realized that it must have been very difficult for this woman to tell the truth that heinous about herself at any point in her life even the very end and I was grateful that she had the courage to tell it before she left this world because it's an important truth and we needed to know and I said to myself well thank you for telling the truth you lying ass  and then time goes on and then after time you can kind of see the whole elephant and it's humbling because you realize that this woman lied and that lie caused the murder but that Murder set in motion a sequence of events that made my wonderful life possible that made this very night possible how could this be that this lie could make the world a better place it's maddening and that's how I feel about this president I feel like this  might be the lie that saves us all because I have never felt more American than Jesus Christ good and when it happens I can see everybody that's struggling so if I'm on stage and I tell a joke that makes you want to beat up a transgender then you're probably a piece of  and don't come see me anymore or if you don't understand that when a football player takes a knee during the national anthem he's actually standing up for me but you might not want to  with me anymore but I swear no matter how bad it gets you're my countrymen and I know for a fact that I'm determined to work  out with y'all and if that woman that said that heinous lie was alive today I would thank her for lying

have a hat on when I do it oh sorry about that buddy here you go bubbles forgive me for the Hat thing you know why those bars are so popular now is because men don't know how to deal with women in reality so sometimes we got to take the fantasy Road the reality of the situation is very Grim women made a lot of progress in a short period of time man it changed everything can't deal in relationships anymore I broke up with my girl I'm out of sha shank I'm free I don't want to go back couldn't even argue with her you should be able to argue if you have an issue in a relationship you should be able to argue that issue out right but see ladies you got to stick to the  issue you guys take arguments every everywhere just to win them that's why nothing ever gets done you be arguing about the dishes baby baby could you wash your dish at least before you put in the sink premature ejaculator damn it you know why you got to bring that up I don't even believe in that I don't if I come man it was right on time that's what I ask as far as I'm concerned I can't come fast to I'm sick of being vilified all the time David how could you how could you come I was  what were you trying

Dave Chappelle,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKc0fhwfmpc,well it's the last show here we are Los Angeles the world capital of rape and Dick Brown the  has been going on out here he's gonna work well just what you think can't get worse they got Charlie Rose today it's gonna be quiet morning on the news tomorrow Charlie Rose looking kangaroo every body is raping like hotcakes I for one was starting to get worried you know I've been in Show Business 30 years I had no idea how much danger I was in that's really some scary  I gotta tell you Harvey Weinstein is probably the first person that I ever looked at a photograph of him was like yeah he rapes I'm not sure this  has a choice not a handsome man a lot of meat and extra skin on his face yeah he's ugly you know the sad part is he's done so well in life he probably doesn't know he's ugly you know when you're good looking everybody will tell you oh you look wonderful he's so great looking when you're ugly you gotta figure that  out for yourself it's a lot of putting Clues together through his why am I not getting in the club I got all the right  because it was Brad Pitt doing that  he wouldn't hurt the people the girl just come back down like I got the part  yeah and yet it is important that I acknowledge ladies you are absolutely right there you go they got all be mindful of that guys because uh it's going to happen to any of us it happened to me I can see that I see myself showing up I am here for my 3am with Mr Weinstein hey Harvey I got your text I'm here to talk about the script seems like it's gonna be hard to read and Candlelight but I guess I could try like a  nightmare could you imagine that  did you manage using a business meeting and a  pulled their dick out in the middle of the meet I'll be like yo yo my man is the most unprofessional  I've ever seen in all my days just let me finish Dave Chappelle I'll put you in all three Lord of the Rings  hurry up  I have other meetings now I have a 4 30 a.m in Brett ratner's house I believe it's wardrobe fitting accidentally wow I mean it is really bad out here isn't it Kevin Spacey's out here grabbing Men by the  possible you got the guy from Star Trek the Next Generation that's the uh that's what we got last time we sound like he was more than that but that's that's who's Set It Off he's 14 years old and Kevin Spacey costume at a party which I gotta say by the way for the record been to a lot of parties in my day never been to a good one that had 14 year old boys in it not even when I was 13. you know what I mean who was the kicker with a bunch of Hubba Bubba chewing  like having a good time  yeah ironically kid grew up to be gay anyway which means getting space he can sniff that  out like a truffle pig yeah he's one of me and not the victim blame but it seems like the kind of situation that the gay 14 year old would get himself into say that right but it's true  like you know I say that though because I went to an Arts High School and like all them  was gay man like in high school oh them dudes was gay and them gay dudes is way more mature than the rest of us and we didn't know why we just knew they was mature you ever see gay dude at lunch perfect posture I think even responsible I'm gonna take that thermos down he'd be like what the  is that it's a snake of drinking wine with lunch we didn't know what it was because we were young boys we just trying to figure out who we were and we didn't realize these gay dudes was fighting to be who they knew they already were some impressive  they were Fearless to gay kids  Fearless I've never seen a scared gay dude in my life what kind of man has no fear you'll be tied up in a hostage situation with a gay dude the  will still be like I'm thirsty I'm thirsty David I need something to drink well then shoot me I would rather die of a bullet than dehydration  I am thirsty I need some water it's all jokes aside Kevin Spacey shouldn't done that  today again he's 14 years old and was forced to carry a grown man's Secret for 30 years Jesus Christ he must have been busting at the scenes with him the saddest part is if you were able to carry that secret for six more months I would get to know how House of Cards ends  yeah ladies and gentlemen these are dark Dark Times New York Times said uh the Louis CK  on his own stomach now I've busted a lot of nuts in my day none of them were newsworthy she was really gross because they didn't just say like I said it didn't just say Chisholm something they said it in that  Pulitzer prize-winning style that the New York Times has was very descriptive like you know what I mean Louis C days Siemens shout out like a volcano misogyny slowly drizzling down like lava covering his freckled penis as it slowly dripped to a fiery crown of red hair Jesus Christ I'm trying to eat some labels rancheros you know the tough part being a comedian knowing the  everybody comes up to me like did you know did you know what Louis was doing no  I did not know  you think we talk about at the comedy club hey  how was the weekend great man I'm just jerking off in faces and coming on my own stomach having a good time you know how this business is no I didn't know they act like we sit around like Greece tell me more tell me more they think put up a fight sorry I don't know the choreography but you get the point you get the point she was intense but Louis is like the turning point I mean you know I all these allegations are terrible Louise was the only I shouldn't say this but  it he's his allegation was the only one that made me like laugh s with all his friends reading it and he's jerking off and he's surprising people he surprised me that's pretty all the comics and comedy just reading like what it's terrible I know this is terrible I'm sorry ladies you're right you are right but at the same time I mean you know what I mean I don't know Jesus Christ they took everything from Louis it was like and it might be disproportionate I can't tell I can't tell this is like where it's hard to be a man one lady said Louis CK masturbating in front of me ruined my comedy dreams word well then I dare say madam you may have never had a dream come on man that's a brittle spirit that is a brittle-ass spirit  that  is too much it's grown-ass woman you know what this  is like it's like cointel Pro you know what that is it's a program that the FBI had on the jail Hoover in this program one of the many things they did was they would track the sexual habits of anyone they considered an Enemy of the State it was a lit button that's why they got all these  sex tapes with Martin Luther King   but lucky for us he actually had a drink  do you think if Louis CK jerk off in front of the doctor can you be like I can't continue this movement I'm sorry but the freedom of black people must be stopped I didn't know this  was gonna pull this dick out and jerk off like this I just thought we were gonna get a couple of drinks and chill business is just harder than that the women sound like I hate to say y'all it's sound weak I know it sounds  up I'm not supposed to say that but one of these ladies was like let me see Kate was masturbating while I was on the phone with him  you don't know how to hang up a phone how the  are you going to survive in Show Business if this is an actual obstacle to your dreams I know Louie is wrong ma'am I'm just saying I'm held to a higher standard of accountability than these women are don't forget who I am don't forget what I am I I'm a black dude and don't ever forget how I got here my ancestors were kidnapped I don't even know where the  I'm from they were put on the bottom boats they sell them across the Atlantic many of them died Only the strongest survived and once they got here they beat the humanity out of my people they turned us into Beast of burdens they made us do their work and the irony is hundreds of years later they called us lazy we've fought in Civil War we damn near freed ourselves then in reconstruction black people did great my great grandfather was a very wealthy man but then the Black Codes came Jim Crow came it was a hundred years of unspeakable oppression again lynchings all kinds of terroristic acts to keep us in the margins of society yeah we still fought and Dr Kings Born and then things got better 20 years after Dr King was assassinated Michael Jackson was Moon walking on television something something Barack Obama  Donald Trump and here we all are 400 year nightmare took us 400 years to figure out as a people that white people's weakness the whole time was kneeling during the national anthem that's a brittle spirit that's right  on the Rock it's regular ah I'm doing  the vice president of the United States got involved Mike Pence got involved he went to the game himself these  will have to stand when they send me foreign football players looked up in the stands and saw Mike princesses come on y'all  foiled brittle spirit I kill every white person in America at one time you know how to do it I would just wait for the Super Bowl right when they sing the national anthem I'd have O.J Simpson walk to the 50-yard line with them bad knees I know what he's gonna do stop him oh you got a man the  up yo I don't mean to be disrespectful because man I know you're upset what I said but you know I know you I know you're right but come on baby it's me I was right once remember that anybody remember when I was like missing from show business for 12 years remember when I had like this really popular show when I quit I remember I walked away from 50 million dollars a lot harder than walking away from Louie's Freckle dick  I didn't know that I'd ever work again here I am tonight did my dream die no I remember that  you don't remember that when I put my shirt when I went on the way out the door I said something's wrong in Hollywood I believe they said I smoked crack that's what I remember they called me crazy so really you know you're right ladies congratulations enjoy it and they're coming for you  they come if we one person that's uncomfortable you know who's the most uncomfortable  in the room the  that's right I was right at an orgy once nobody  me  let's just walk around like Tom Cruise and then Lewis looking  and ruin the whole orgy by accident it's easier to ruin an orgy than you think all you got to do is wait for it to get kind of quiet and then go ew and I feel bad but I just feel like this is all happening for a reason and ladies I want you to win this fight ten years ago I might have been scared but you know I got a daughter now so if you win she wins so I'm rooting for you and I agree with you at least ideologically I do I don't know if the I don't know if you're doing it just right but I mean who am I to say I don't think you're wrong I just think that you can't make a lasting peace this way you got all the bad guys scared and that's good but the minute they're not scared anymore it will get worse than it was before fear does not make lasting peace that's black people and that's what it is what this city really needs uh without irony I'll say this the kill for La is in South Africa you  need Truth and Reconciliation with one another because the end of Apartheid should have been a  bloodbath by any metric in human history and it wasn't and the only reason it wasn't is because Desmond Tutu and Mandela and all these guys figured out that if a system is corrupt then the people who adhere to the system and are incentivized by that system are not criminals they are victims and that the system itself must be tried but because the house systems work is so compartmentalized as far as information the only way we can figure out what the system is is if everybody says what they did tell them how you participated because men want to help they're just scared because Ben Affleck tried to help hey what happened to these ladies is disgusting oh  you grabbed a Teddy in 95. all right fellas I'm out  that I ain't helping I just want to help I want to be a good guy like I can't even say the word me too anymore  tonight was like Dave I'm going to the comedy club I was like I am also going to the concert and I didn't even know what was happening but I guess I became like a feminist in the last three weeks because I can't watch porn the same like I watch it sometimes but I can't I can't click on these  thumbnails not with those titles guy crams young girl in the ass with hard right other than I can't click on that come on  give me something I can click on dudes get sucked off by a  little person I say to myself it takes me hours to find one clip what the hell is this marginally groomed feminists enjoys consensual sex vaguely homosexual guy with penis the same color as men click you notice a lot of black dudes haven't been getting me too I don't drinks myself you know why though obviously black women go through the same thing right the reason is because black women from slavery won't tell on us because they know and no matter how bad we black dudes are like those are very mean scared to see us get punished my wife is Asian she telling me in a goddamn second ain't no  up in the Chappelle house and the wildest  about it is I live in Trump country I live amongst the ticket torch whites poor white people and I'm rich it was never Pitchfork time  I'm in a lot of trouble and nobody else my family believes me I've been trying to tell the kids man we're gonna run these drills they're like we don't want to run in your stupid drills too bad son you have to digital torch whites come upside what are you guys supposed to do come on there what are you guys supposed to do squint our eyes and stand next to Mom that's right  and what are you gonna bring me your gun and your groundskeeper uniform that's right I'll go outside and see what they want it is wild bro where you from man um leaving he's from Manhattan you are from Brooklyn aren't you you look like you can rob somebody with a hammer Brooklyn  Robbie was  they find around the house I'm  around yeah man well you ladies are right be honest with you your lives look terrifying to me they do man I know nothing about being a woman but I know fear yo I used to live in New York when I was 17. and I couldn't even pay my bills you know what I didn't make money I used to do shows for drug dealers that wanted to clean their money up one time I did a real good set and these  called me in the back room they gave me 25 000 in cash it's probably 18 19 years old I'm scared I thank them profusely I put that money in my backpack I jumped on subway and started heading towards Brooklyn at one o'clock in the morning never been that terrified of my life is that never my life had something that somebody else would want I thought to myself Jesus Christ if  knew how much money I had in this backpack they'd kill me for it and then I thought holy  what if I had a  on me all the time that's what women are dealing with let me tell you right now it's a real talk with them same drug dealers gave me a  and said put this in your backpack and take it to Brooklyn that'd be like  I can't accept this okay I empathize man you know everybody gets mad because I say these jokes but she understand it this is the best time to say them more now than ever I know there's some comedians in the back  you have a responsibility to speak recklessly otherwise my kids may never know what Reckless talk sounds like the joys of being wrong I didn't come here to be right just came here to  around it's hot in here suddenly isn't it I wonder where that heat came from um I wonder what happened to me where did I go for 12 years if I wasn't raped you know maybe there's something else going on maybe these rapes aren't even the worst of it wouldn't that be something wouldn't that be something you can go ahead and go to the bathroom Brooklyn you don't need to hear this  you see that  right there he's on an enormous amount of pressure he is just being big and black with that hair dude   suspect for everything it's that white collar crime  sometimes I wouldn't talk about where I went but y'all don't even want to know I was gone for a long time I was in the upside down scary being a white dude now isn't it a little bit no well you're not gonna give me two but you know what I mean it's funny for black dudes to see why people go through this because this is how it always is for us all my heroes is either murdered by the government or registered sex offenders sad I know man but we've already been through it like Michael Jackson Remember When they said all that  about Michael Jackson they never proved anything to those dying day but they said that he did some very heinous things and one time I watched a documentary about it they were talking about all this  Michael Jackson allegedly did and as they were saying all these allegations he started showing pictures of his home the Neverland Ranch you ever seen Michael Jackson's house on television well the short of it is there's a lot of things for kids to do with that place and I saw the whole thing exotic animals and Ferris wheels and merry-go-rounds and  and the more they showed it the more certain I was that I don't think Michael Jackson did any of those things they said he did house didn't look sexual it looked like he was flossing on those  didn't look like he was trying to  kids it looked like he's just trying to impress him like this nigga's Jay-Z for kids when he was walking through his house this is my cotton candy machine it makes three tons of cotton candy a day you know all the cotton candy you want this closet is filled with nothing but custom-made karate slippers Isn't that cool yeah I have my monkey bringing some cupcakes hey guys let's watch a movie what movie do you want to see Home Alone Oh No No don't touch the DVD player what color car comes here he can act it out act out home alone for my guests and the kids was like man you are all right mister this is fantastic man we had you all wrong all around what I don't understand what do you mean huh oh well you know man we thought it was going to be the usually you can have us come over and give some wine cooler you know psychiatics keep by trying to suck your dick  I was trying to show you a better life bubbles get these kids the  out of my house just like everyone else Hollywood is no place for moral absolutism you know what I mean we must never forget our Kelly peed on a 15 year old girl and he also wrote I believe I can fly same guy same lifetime if I showed you that video of him peeing on that girl and scored it I Believe I Can Fly he'd be torn I used to think that I could not go on you would know how to feel if I can see it it's okay my career ended many years ago foreign ER no I'm terrible I'm terrible I'm sorry everybody I'm sorry you wanna know what happened to me this is tempting but I don't want to talk about it maybe at the end when I run out of things to talk about oh  I'm almost there I'm just trying to tell you what happened to me it was not it I just didn't have a good go of it I don't know what you guys think happens when you quit a successful show like this I'll tell you what doesn't happen they don't go hey well good luck with your future endeavors yeah that's not what happens it was cold out there for real I had to watch it all go down without me I had to watch all those people do my show Key and Peele and name them and see well I'm not gonna say they were doing my show I'm just saying they were awfully similar I was mad and people would come up to me on the street and be like yo  every once in a while most people thought it's crazy but sometimes people come and go  you did the right thing man you my hero  I don't want to be on here I want to be rich never choose to be a hero because Heroes die in uncomfortable deaths all I wanted to be was Paul Revere I just needed one heroic moment you understand it was only one night and then 40 Years of him being like hey y'all remember that time everybody was asleep and I was up and the British was coming boy it's a good thing I was awake  everybody be there that's why I wanted to start a GoFundMe for Colin Kaepernick I do man I'm fascinated with them I want to make sure he never has to play football again he can't if he wants to I just don't want them to have to because why the  not always rich and people would be like I'm not giving a GoFundMe to a rich dude but you should you should because that motherfucker's life was going great he's so light-skinned he didn't have to save his black and yet he took a knee during that anthem for us thought about us when things were going good when his belly was full when he was he didn't think about his livelihood or any of that and they took his livelihood away from him like man that shouldn't be the way it is every  person that takes a stand for somebody else always gets beat down and we watch it over and over and over again we watch it but we should pay those  for throwing a whistle because they make our lives better and we could change the narrative we could make one  have a good outcome for doing the right thing and that would make another  be brave enough to do the right thing and if you did that the  like Harvey Weinstein went right for 40 years because Vision was a stupid ass part should take care of each other wouldn't it be nice to be like remember that time he's gonna kill Jesus but then he got all that money  oh Real Talk man it's not a racial thing it's about us making our society better it's about like even these women that are coming forward and they will say they're Brave and many of them are and a few of them a few of them sucked the dick and got buyers remorse foreign from this narrative this would have gone this far some women weren't willing to do it you can't ask every woman to help hold the line some women can carry things heavier than others so we should fight for one another we should forgive the ones of us that are weaker and support the ones with us that are stronger and then we can beat the thing you guys keep going after individuals the system is going to stay intact you have to have men on your side and I'm telling you right now you're gonna have a lot of imperfect outlies I'll tell you what happened but I can't say it directly there's a book to me that encapsulates my entire experience before I left the show and the book is called pimp it's written by a guy named Iceberg Slim yeah bring it up here this is Matthew was from France it's white and yet he has an original copy of this book written by a black American who was a pimp in the 40s Iceberg Slim his real name was Robert Beck the guy the name Iceberg because he was in a bar in Chicago when there was a shootout in the bar and a bullet went to this nigga's hat and he still finished his dream pimps love  like that they said man you ice cold he said I like that and it's stuck this book is so heavy in the front it has a glossary of damp terms because the ideas are so foreign to the American ears for instance do you know what the phrase mileage on a hoe means of course you don't mind Jonah ho was a very wild concept it means that pimps understand there's a finite amount of bad  A person can do before they'll lose their  mind and a good pimp can look at a woman that he's never seen before and call it she's good for 500  that's her mileage anything over that that  is going to spill they do it to you why the  you think most of us work from nine to five it's nine to six my killer  Iceberg Slim was the one that broke down where the bottom  was does anyone know where the bottom  is anyway what's the bottom  sir it's your uh it's your prostitute that's the best out of all of them that brings in the bus money that's right that's exactly right are you black that's right the bottom  are Pimp's number one hoe she's even a  that helps him keep the other  in line I will repeat she's even a  that helps him keep the other  in line for pimp was McDonald's and the bottom  is french fries hahaha the rest of the  like fish sandwiches and cherry pies and  like that Iceberg Slim breaks down some of the coldest capitalist Concepts I've ever heard in my life he describes in detail how these men break women so that they will give them the money that they make with their own bodies there's a story in here so cold it makes me shudder to think about it well Iceberg Slim is trying to control the woman that he finds uncontrollable so he asks older people how he can Reign her in and the older pimp says oh that's easy iceberg all you have to do is beat that  with a coat hanger and then run her a bath and give her some pills she'll be so grateful that you fixed her that she'll forget you were the  that beat her in the first place that's some cold  now the End of This Book Iceberg Slim tells a story it's kind of the crescendo of the book and in the story Iceberg Slim's bottom  is at the end of a mileage if she was good for 500 bucks she was at 498. she was bubbling you could see it she was going crazy she started saying all kinds of  oh I always wanted to be in Circus circuses  I can juggle too you know juggle he had to let it go it's hard to let it go a bottom  go and he wasn't ready to let it go because his organization couldn't handle losing her but she didn't know that she didn't know how important she was so what he did was he called her to Edina he said look  you and I got to part ways she said fine  I don't need you anyway because I know somebody at Ringling Brothers she's like all right whatever I got one last trick for you it's a big money trick you do this for me you get paid I get paid and we go our separate ways she said fine  what do you want me to do he said okay there's a guy in that hotel across the street he's waiting for you in room number seven once you go over there and I want you to  them but before you do I need to put some of this stuff in this drink and then he's gonna fall asleep but he does there's a briefcase in his bed bring the briefcase to me that's the trick  can you handle it she said  I can handle it I can't wait to get rid of you she ran outside jumped on a unicycle pedal across the street laughs an iceberg washer he's like man she's pretty good man if I never jerked off in the face maybe she would have been in the circus right now and she runs up to motel steps and she disappears in the room number seven she's gone for a real long time real long time so long the fact that Iceberg got a little worried but then suddenly she came back hold on  where's the briefcase she said I didn't get his daddy he's putting me didn't get a briefcase  what's wrong with you she said I did everything you said but but that man don't look right something wrong Daddy what do you mean something's wrong  did you put that stuff in this drink she said I did everything you said Daddy I put all of it in his drink he said wait a minute  wait a minute you put all of it in the striker now he had to see for himself two of them go across the street to the motel they go in the room number seven and on the bed laying lifelessly is the white man that she was supposed to  it's a nice person you right  she don't look good what the  so we call it a friend of his that was a doctor that was close by and the doctor came in gave the guy a thorough examination and told them both what was obvious slim this  is dead oh god daddy oh no oh no we killed him he said calm down  we didn't do anything he reached on the bed and grabbed the briefcase he popped it open it's filled with money more money than anyone ever seen took a little bit of the money and gave it to the doctor and the doctor left discreetly all right  let me think I can fix this for you I know somebody I can go but if I call him I'm gonna hold these  a big favor oh god daddy please I don't want to go to jail neither do I have  so you shut up and pick up the phone she heard a mumble in the phone a little bit he hung up the phone and she was pacing the room and he was just standing there cool and they were waiting and they were waiting and suddenly A van pulled up downstairs two guys get out with a carpet they walk upstairs they roll that carpet out on the floor they throw the body in the carpet they roll that  up like a burrito they picked that  up and they throw it in the back of the van and come back up and Iceberg opens a briefcase again and gives them a little money he says I'll get in touch with you guys later they say you're not gonna get in touch with us at all we'll find you he said whatever  and they bounced oh god daddy oh God it's just relaxed  listen we're getting the  out of here you go downstairs you get the car but you had to leave separately she when she got the car Iceberg grabbed that briefcase waited a few minutes looked out the window and then he went down with her they both got in the car and they drove off she was a blubbering mess oh  he said I told you  we didn't do didn't do a  and I cleaned him up and now we got us a secret okay I know I'm not gonna tell  it's you oh no I ain't gonna tell he's all right baby go I'm gonna need you to stay with me for a while after this  cools down she goes okay okay okay that's the game that's how the whole  Works ladies you understand this  was at the end of a mileage she was at 498 she ended up tricking for Iceberg for another six months she must attend another 200 tricks for him do you understand some cold  and the code  about it is that the dead guy on the bed wasn't even dead at all this  was just a friend of icebergs acting like he's asleep the doctor went doctor was  butcher that happened to have a white coat and the dudes who came in the moving van clothes was dressed like movers because they were movers Iceberg had gotten a new apartment and the bag of money was iceberg's money in the first place the money he got from all those women that's a cold game that's the  capitalist Manifesto and that's why I went to South Africa so now we got us a little secret 
Dave Chappelle,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7M8cWuLLB0,"thank you thank  you I like not knowing what's going to happen I like making memories sometimes I do all this crazy around my colleagues just so that they can tell their friends I did it but rather than talk about myself just briefly I want to just talk about my genre standup comedy is an incredibly American genre I don't think any other country could produce this many comedians and unbeknownst to many people in this audience I don't think there's opinion that it exists in this country that is not represented in a comedy club by somebody each and every one of you has a champion in the room we watch you guys fight but when we're together we talk it out I know Comics that are very racist and I watch him on stage and everyone's laughing and I'm like that mother means that don't get mad at them don't hate them we go upstairs and have a beer and sometimes I even appreciate the Artistry that they paint their racist opinions with man it's not that serious the first amendment is first for a reason the Second Amendment is just in case the first one doesn't work out we got to let some air out of the bowl man the country is getting a little tight it doesn't feel like it's ever felt in my lifetime so tonight I am honored that my colleagues are here in comedy and in music and I want everyone in America right now to look at me look at me smoking indoors I didn't ask anybody I just did it what they going to do kick me out before I get the prize no  this is called Leverage the thing I like best about tonight was that I saw so many people from different parts of my life like friends that I grew up with here in DC friends of mine from Ohio then and now friends of mine from comedy clubs all musicians that blew my mind you guys have no idea how he inspired me I I I want to give a special shout out to my OG Tony Woods Miles Davis has a a quote uh it's one of my favorite Miles Davis said so much cool but but one of the things he said I always loved he said it took me years to learn how to play like myself you know he would watch other musicians and he would try to play like dizzy or bird all the guys who were great Tony Woods was my dizzy and bird if I was a miles I was trying to play like you you were the first person I ever saw do it absolutely right you feel this and he told the truth there's something so true about this genre when done correctly that I will fight anybody that gets a a true practitioner of this art form's way cuz I know you're wrong this is the truth and you are obstructing it I'm not talking about the content I'm talking about the art form do you understand do we have an agreement and what I really wanted to say tonight when I'm glad I get the platform to do it I'm gay I am gay and I can't wait to see what this does for my career being gay like this so many special shoutouts one of the main architects of the comeback of the century my brother and my mentor the mighty Stan laan I never dreamed that I would be able to work with someone as great as you these last five specials straight fire I wouldn't want to do another special with anybody else but you so eat your mother vegetables and live as long as you can cuz we doing a few more of these  Neil Brenan your speech made me cry because it reminded me of all those hard days of work and all that money I never got for it the other real special shout out I got to make cuz none of this would have been possible on any level uh without this person is my mother  mom my mother mom mom mom mom you have no idea what I put this woman through if you just given birth to me that would have been more than enough but the fact that she raised me and raised me well we had a real oral tradition in our house I knew the word Grio when I was a little boy a Grio was a person in Africa who's charged with keeping the stories of The Village everyone would tell Grio the stories and they would remember them all so that they could tell future Generations when they got old they tell them to someone else and they say in Africa when a Grio dies it's like a library was burnt down and my mother used to tell me before I ever thought about doing comment she said you should be a Grio and she fill me with every story of black life you know she's educated in African-American studies and she would let me understand the context that I was being raised in that I'm being raised in a hostile environment that I have to tame by the time I was for 14 years old I was in nightclubs mastering an adult world it's terrifying crack epidemic was going on and my mother would hear gunshots outside and be scared of death maybe it's my son but early in my career if you remember Mom you used to sit in the club with me you do a full day of work you'd be back there falling asleep just waiting for me to go on she would watch my show every night do you know how long that car ride is  home how many of you have ever heard your mother say jokes were a little too much tonight  son I was a soft kid I was sensitive I'd cry easy and I would be scared to fist fight and my mother used to tell me this thing I don't even know if you remember but you said this to me more than once you said Son sometimes you have to be a lion so you can be the lamb you really are are I talk this like a lion I'm not afraid of any of you when it comes word to word I will gab with the best of them just so I can chill and be me and that's why I love my art form cuz I understand every practition of it whether I agree with them or not I know where they're coming from they want to be heard they got something to say there's something they notice they just want to be understood love this genre it saved my life so so tonight Mom I would like to honor you in a very special way that I cannot do on my own but because now I'm a man with great and influential friends i' like to ask my man Thundercat to come out on stage Thundercat the mighty most de Washington DC thank you very much for giving me a home and a place to start today is officially of Dave Chappelle day in Washington DC the mayor declared it last night okay before I did Killing Him Softly when I was 22 HBO gave me the biggest opportunity of my life at that time they gave me a half hour special but this  was not like a special you know what I mean it was like generic it didn't even have a title it was just Dave spel and I shot it in San Francisco at a place called Broadway Studios which is on the second floor of building and beneath Broadway Studios is a nightclub and the special was only supposed to be 30 minutes and I got ready I practiced I did all the  I was supposed to do and and the night that I taped 20 minutes into my 30 minute set I'll never forget this music music Started blasting from the nightclub underneath you could hear it real loud and it  my whole show up and I was devastated I was a young man I really believed in what I was doing and I thought that my dream had been killed so when I got off stage I ran down the steps to the alley behind Broadway Studios and where the control trucks are parked and I kicked that  door open and I started yelling at all the producers I was nobody in Show Business just a guy that believed him I said man you  everything up that  music what the  were you thinking and there was a a guy who was a big time producer I ain't saying no names and he stood up and he said Hey kid sit the  down he said we didn't ruin anything he said we made a deal with that nightclub to not play music and they didn't honor the deal and I said who did honor the deal and he pointed to a guy I'll never forget it was old white man sitting in the four tourus by himself and he said that guy right there and I I didn't waste no time or ask no questions I went to that Ford tourist and I beat on that window and I said open the door  I want to talk to you and that old man looked at me for one second and wisely drove the  off and left me in the alley cussing at anybody who would listen and 2 minutes later literally 120 seconds later couldn't have been any more than that the doors of the kitchen in the alley of that nightclub underneath Broadway Studios slung open and that old man was standing there that same old man with reinforcements he had two big goons with him and he looked at me he was calm as a cucumber he said you come here I want to talk to you I didn't know anything about the streets this age but I found out later in my life that these men were were Russian mobsters and I don't know what you guys know about the Russian M but these are the  that killed Denzel in Training Day and all the producers knew what I was up against they said Dave do not go in there and I said  y'all and I walk right into that kitchen and they closed the doors behind me and it got dark as  in there and I knew I'm not dumb I knew I was in a bad situation but you have to understand I believed in what I was doing and I didn't give a  just kept cussing at these  telling them how they ruined my life and that old man couldn't believe that I was talking all this  and as soon as I took a breath he stopped Me Gently he said Hey kid listen your friends lied to you he said we made a deal but your friends never paid me and when he said that I realized I was locked in the kitchen I realized he was telling the truth which would make me wrong and the moment the very moment that I realized I was wrong for the first time I was afraid you see it's a funny thing if you believe you're absolutely right you can get drunk off the feeling of how right you are it's why gay people are so mean but I didn't buckle you guys would have been very proud of me I was scared but I didn't Buckle I said well then sir I owe you an apology but I believe that no matter what reason that music was playing it ruined my life and that old man looked at me with with sympathy in his eyes and he walked over to me and he he gently placed his hand on my cheek which I got to tell you is a very emasculating thing to do I was standing there looking at this nigga's hand on my cheek like and he said you are a real man and he tapped me on my cheek real soft just like that the doors open back up the light from the alley flooded into the kitchen and I just walked out alive I lived to fight another day and in that moment I learned one of the most valuable lessons of my life and I have to share with you and that lesson is this in your life in any given moment the strongest dream in that moment wins that moment I am a very powerful Dreamer yeah I'm not  lying I dreamed tonight this very night as a 14-year-old boy and I am living it as a 50-year-old man my dreams are very strong today I walked all around Washington I used to be poor in this city and all day people just said hey Dave hey Dave like they knew me personally and I felt like I knew them and I say to myself my God Dave what a powerful dream but then sometimes sometimes I feel regular feel like myself maybe I'll smoke some weed and be some nightclub and feel shy but I'll look across a nightclub and I'll see some guy that no one's ever never heard of but this  worked all week and got bottle service and his  bringing moette with sparklers to him I picture him in my mind he's Persian he's doing some kind of weird Persian dance and he got six  at his table cuz he got so much liing and they all calling his name go Cena go Cena and I'll be looking across the room like oh my God I'm in that guy's dream I can hear him telling his friends hey how was the club last night like man that  was fantastic I had bottle service I seen D pel cross Club looking at me like oo who is that and that's the trick to life you have to be wise enough to know when you were living in your dream and you have to be humble enough to accept when you're in someone else's it's why it's why I don't judge between Wills Smith and Chris Rock because you guys look at them as big ideas but I look at them as fellow dreamers I can't judge between them because I see myself in both of them I am Will Smith I am the man that cannot take it anymore and will slap the  out of the next person that says a cross word to me or somebody that I love and I am Chris Rock I am the man that can get slapped in front of the whole world and keep my composure so I don't  anything up that is what men do men make boundaries men enforce boundaries and Men test boundaries and no man test more boundaries than a trans man when I see a fellow dreamer I give them my utmost respect even if I don't understand what their dream is I know a dreamer when I see one and I've met many powerful dreamers in my life none more powerful than a man who calls himself little nzx I met this  at a party I had no idea who he was but the minute he walked in that party I knew I was in his dream everybody in the party was another dreamer everyone was famous but when that  walked in he was dressed like C3PO he was shining and everyone was like oh my god there he is there I didn't know who he was and for some reason I all them dreamers he walked right up to me and he said I tried to get you in my video I don't know what the  he talking about I said what I said what what video and he just look at me like you know what video and walked away and I watched him walk away I said man I said this nigga's having a very powerful dream you know what it reminded me of it reminded me of when we was in grade school remember in grade school the teacher would ask everybody what they want to be Timmy Timmy what do you want to be when you grow up and Timmy acted like he had an idea he'd stand up he said I want to be a fireman and the teacher would say Timmy that is a beautiful train but Timmy didn't mean it Timmy said he wanted to be a fireman cuz deep down Timmy's attracted to fire by the time he's 14 years old this  is a full-blown pyromaniac playing with kerosene and matches like a goddamn expert and then one night he goes downtown with his buddies  around with fire and burns a warehouse down and he doesn't know it but there's 13 migrant workers from El Salvador and they in that  they get trapped and then they die in the fire ain't that a tragedy that was an accident he's only 14 years old but ni black so they try him as an adult and Timmy ends up spending the rest of his life in jail Dream Deferred what about you Billy Billy Billy

that I live because I wanted to tell you all that they came true and I wanted to thank you all for making the man that I am today yes I am living a very powerful dream every time I come to this city and I stand in front of you I realize that my God man this is not my dream at all it's yours and I am honored to be in it thank you very much Washington DC I'll see you next Anthony Bourdain had the greatest job the show business ever produced this  flew around the world and ate delicious meals with outstanding people that man with that job hung himself in a luxury sweet in France they say 2,000 party over oops out of time so tonight I'm going to party like it's 1999 I knew a niggaer in high school that was a urban genius this motherfucker's grades was so good he got all the way from the hood to a Ivy League school with a full scholarship from there the  got himself into one of the best law schools in the country and when he was in law school he met a woman and they fell in love and they were going to get married I remember him telling me about it he was home for Christmas and I told him I said my man my man save that  for late in your life  but he's in love he didn't listen to me he married her while he was in law school and sadly they got divorced while he was in law school he was a street  from the hood this man had nothing and that  took half of that and then I just never saw him again for years and then two years ago I was home in DC doing some shopping trying to buy my son's some socks at Foot Locker I go to Foot Locker guess who's the manager that  dressed like a referee the whole  this  is 45 years old we went out drinking that night just trying to catch up and and he told me he said said he's been living with his mother for like 10 years just trying to get back on his feet but that's not the point of the story the point of the story is never occurred to this  to kill himself he's alive and well in  DC I even suggested to him that he should try it out like I don't know  might  nobody's life is perfect no matter what it looks like from the outside you don't know what the  going on inside I have a great life but it's not a perfect life but it's good it's my shit's like an above ground pool you ever seen one of  them it's a pool so in that Spirit tonight I thought I'd start my show a little differently tonight I'm going to do something that I'm not particularly good at but that I like to do tonight I'm going to try some Impressions out I only got two all right the first impression is kind of dumb but I like it this this is my impression you ready this is my impression of the founding fathers of America when the Constitution was being written you ready here it goes hurry up and finish that Constitution  I'm trying to get some sleep it's not bad  right all right the next one the next one's a little harder I want to see if you can guess who it is I'm doing an impression of all right let me get into character you got to guess who it is though okay here it goes du hey D if you do anything wrong in your life duh and I find out about it I'm going to try to take everything away from you and I don't care when I find out could be today tomorrow 15 20 years from now if I find out you're  the finished who who's that that's you that's what the audience sounds like to  me that's why I don't think coming out doing comedy all the time cuz y'all  is the worst  I've ever tried to entertain in my  life oh godamn sick of it this is the worst time ever to be a celebrity he going to be finished everyone's doomed Michael Jackson has been dead for 10 years and this  has two new  cases and if you haven't watched that documentary uh then I'm begging you don't watch it it's  gross I felt like HBO was sticking baby dicks in my ears for 4 hours straight really nasty  I want to know all these things turns out uh Michael Jackson allegedly likes a long Gander at the anus they said he STS at people's butth holes that's what they said that's how gross the documentary was I'm going to say something that I'm not allowed to say but I got to be real I don't believe these  I do not believe it but let me qualify the statement I I am what's known on the streets as a victim blame you know what I mean somebody come up to me like Dave Dave Chris Brown just beat up Rihanna I'll be like well what does she  do Dave Michael Jackson was molested children well what were those kids wearing at the  time I don't think n did it but you know what even if he did do it you know what I mean you know what I mean I mean it's Michael Jackson I know more than half the people in this room have been molested in their lives but it wasn't no goddamn Michael Jackson was it this kid got his dick sucked by the King of Pop all we get is awkward thanksgivings for the rest of our  lives you know how good it must have felt to go to school the next day after that  hey Billy how was the weekend how was my weekend Michael Jackson sucks my dick and that was my first sexual experience if I'm starting here then sky the  limit I know it seems harsh but man somebody's got to teach these kids there's no such thing as a free trip to Hawaii he's going to want to look at your butthole or  something you know why I don't believe it you know why I don't believe it because Michael Jackson's out here doing all this molesting then then why not mccauly caen H mccauly cin said in an interview that Michael Jackson never did anything inappropriate with him or even around him think about that  you know I'm not a pedophile but if I was Mullen Caulkins the first kid I'm  I'll tell you that right  man I'd be a goddamn hero hey that guy over there  the kid from Home Alone and you know how hard he is to catch  my mind's telling me  no celebrity hunting season doesn't matter what I say they're going to get everybody eventually like look I don't think I did anything wrong but but we'll see they even got poor Kevin Hart can you imagine such a thing Kevin Hart let me tell you something it was it was Kevin Hart's dream to host the Oscars that's what he told me I remember when he told me cuz I was thinking to myself well that's an awfully strange dream for an African-American kind of  dreams of hosting the oscas Kevin did that's who and he did it against all the odds Kevin became the most famous comedian this world has ever seen and he got the job that only one black man performant had he was going to host the 80th ospice and I don't know what you know about Kevin but I know Kevin Hart is damn near perfect as close to perfect as anybody I've ever seen in fact Kevin is precisely four tweets shy of being perfect 10 years ago Kevin had made some very homophobic comments and I'm not going to repeat what he said because this is Atlanta you know what I mean I'm sure there's a lot of gay men here tonight with their wives far big from me to offend anybody all right I'll tell you what he said but just for remember these were not my words these were Kevin's words it was a long time ago and I'm paraphrasing cuz I'm not good at telling other people's jokes Okay Kevin said that if his little son was demonstrating or or exhibiting uh homosexual Behavior around the house that he chastised him he'd say hey that's gay and then he said he would smash a dollhouse over that child's head ooh the gay community was furious and I don't blame him I got a lot of gay friends and all of them 100% of them all have told me  horror stories about the  they had to go through just to be themselves crazy crazy stories and in all those stories I got to say not one of them has ever mentioned anything like their father smashing a  dollhouse over their head cuz clearly Kevin was joking think about it you would have to buy this  dollhous to break it over his head in the first place does that sound right is anybody going to do that the gay community was upset and then they put so much pressure on the Academy of Motion Pictures and Sciences that they went to Kevin and said if you don't apologize to that Community then you cannot host these Oscars and then Kevin said  it I   quit and then he went on every talk show in America and apologized for 6 weeks Kevin  up I understand the mistake you made because I've made the same mistake early in my career this is many years ago 15 years ago this when I was doing Chappelle show there's a thank you thank you on network television they have a department that's called standards and practices this is the department that tells you what you can and cannot say on television and if you're doing your job well you should never hear from them but if you're making Chapelle show you'll hear from these  all the time and remember this is 15 years ago I made a mistake I didn't even know I had done anything wrong I had written a sketch that had the word  in it so I had to go to standards and practices they call me up I don't know why they're calling me but I like the lady that runs the department she's usually really fair and was one of my favorite people I've ever worked with so she sits me down we have nice conversation she tells me oh the sketches are great I go oh fantastic well well then why am I here she said because David there's no way that you can ever say the word  on our Network I didn't know I did anything wrong I didn't try to defend myself I said all right  it I'll take it out have a good afternoon and as I was leaving it occurred to me hey hey Renee quick question it's just a question seriously I want to know like why why is it why is it that that I can say the word  with impunity  but I can't say the word  and she said because David you are not gay I said well Renee I'm not a  either but you see what I didn't realize at the time and what Kevin had to learn the hard way is we were breaking an Unwritten and unspoken rule of Show Business and if I say it you'll know that I'm telling you the truth the rule is that no matter what you do in your artistic expression you are never ever allowed to upset the alphabet people you know who I mean those people that took 20% of the alphabet for themselves I'd say the letters but I don't want to conjure their anger that's it's too late now I'm talking about them L's and them B's and them G's and the t's people be surprised I have friends all kinds of letters everybody loves me and I love everybody I got friends with L's I got friends with B's and I got friends with G's but the tees hate my  guts and I don't blame them it's not their fault it's mine I can't stop telling jokes about these things I don't want to write these jokes but I just can't stop you know you hear all those letters together all the time lbgt lbgt and you think it's just one big movement it's not all those letters are their own movement they just travel in the same car together and my guess is what do this High School this  probably got a babysit or something go on answer your phone  get that  out of here I'm in the middle of something  important would it be fun if we made fun of him he like he went outside like hello Mama's dead oh no  mama that's a weird time phone call wasn't it it's like his phone is gay  like I was saying my guess is the G's are driving that car that makes sense to me cuz there's white men in the G's and these people are trying to get around uh discrimination and oppression and you know how white dudes are we know these roads in fact we built these roads the rest of you buckle up will'll get you to where you want to go so the G's are just driving the car of course next to the G's in the passenger seat is the elves everybody likes the elves except for the G's I don't know what that's about I just know the G's don't like them that much the G's always say like little subliminal digs on them it's unnecessary  it's not mean but you know what I mean they just be like I wouldn't wear that the only thing that breaks the tension between the L's and G's are the B's in the back seat that's right there you go everybody scream out when you hear your  letter if there one thing that the L's and the G's agree on is that the bees are  gross they seem greedy to the L's and the G's you know what I mean just sitting in the back seat like yeah man I'll  anybody in this car what's going on  man and sitting next to the bees all the way in the back seat by themselves looking out the window that's the teas everybody in the car respects the te's but everyone also resents the te's it's not the te's fault but everyone in the car just feels like the te's are making the trip take longer anything the te say gets on everybody's nerves and then the te don't even say anything bad they just be in the back talking to himself I'm hot shut up shut the  up okay roll the window down you  I don't know what you what just said I was hot can you pull over at the next exit I need to use the restroom there is not a restroom for you for four states  you just shut the  up so we can get where we're  going and just when that car can't get any more tense the cues are hitchhiker that they pick up on the road some white dude booty shorts just walking in the freeway J see him that guy might be one of us hey are you okay you need some help and he come over there with the booty shorts leaning on the window hey what's going on fellas lady whatever pronoun makes you feel comfortable in the back yeah I don't really know where I'm going I don't know if I'm gay or I'm straight or whatever all I know for sure is that um I really want to get in this car and it make him get into sitting between the bees and the teas I feel bad for teas but they're so confusing and it's not all my my fault I feel like they need to take some responsibility for my jokes cuz I didn't come up with this idea on my own this idea that a person can be born in the wrong body but they have to admit that's a  hilarious predicament it's really  funny if it happened to me you'd laugh wouldn't you that wouldn't be funny if it happened to me I think it would be what if what if it did what if I was what if I was Chinese but but born in this Niger body that's not funny and for the rest of my life I had to go around making that face hey everybody I'm chines and everyone get mad stop making that face that's offensive what this is how I feel  inside on Dave Chappelle day I ask everyone who wishes to celebrate it to make one incredible memory for the himself and or somebody else thank you very much good night"
Dave Chappelle,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKx6DFb065Y,oh boy oh boy I've hav't married a long time I have man you know talk a lot of  about my wife but I love her very much in fact you know you

to be a celebrity he going to be finished everyone's doomed Michael Jackson has been dead for 10 years and this  has two new cases and if you haven't watched that documentary uh then I'm begging you don't watch it it's  gross I felt like HBO was sticking baby dicks in my ears for 4 hours straight really nasty  I want to know all these things turns out uh Michael Jackson allegedly likes a long

don't believe these  I do not believe it but let me qualify the statement I I am what's known on the streets as a victim blamer you know what I mean somebody come up to me like Dave Dave Chris Brown just beat up Rihanna I'll be like well what does she do Dave Michael Jackson was molest the children well what were those kids wearing at the  time I don't think it did it but you know what even if he did do it you know what I  mean you know what I  mean I mean it's Michael Jackson I know more than half the people in this room have been molested in their lives but it wasn't no goddamn Michael Jackson was it this kid got his dick sucked by the King of Pop all we get is awkward thanksgivings for the rest of our lives you know how good it must have felt to go to school the next day after that  hey Billy how was the weekend how is my weekend Michael Jackson sucks my dick and that was my first sexual experience if I'm starting here then sky is the limit   I know it seems harsh but man somebody's got to teach these kids there's no such thing as a free trip to Hawaii he's going to want to look at your butthole or  something you know why I don't believe it you know I don't believe it because Michael Jackson's out here doing all this molesting then then why not mcau cing H MC ckin said in an interview that Michael Jackson never did anything inappropriate with him or even around him think about that  you know I'm not a pedophile but if I was malli Caulkins the first kid I'm  I'll tell you that right now I'd be a goddamn hero hey that guy over there  the kid from Home Alone and you know how hard he is to  catch my mind's telling me no well okay our Kelly is different I mean you know if I'm a betting man I'm going to put my money on he probably did that  I'm pretty sure he did that  you know it's bad okay so a couple years ago I was doing a show in Detroit and I'm sitting backstage in my dressing room a friend of mine comes by this chick dream hampt dream uh tells me right before I'm going on stage she goes Dave I'm working on a documentary on about R Kelly would you like to be in it and I was like nah  I'm cool I went on stage I just forgot about the  and then two years later the documentary comes out surviving R Kelly and when it comes out dreams promoting and  and she keeps bringing me up she said I asked Dave Chappelle to be in my documentary and he said it was too hot for TV  I did not say that it is not even sound like how I talk oh that's too hot for TV I would never say that  but I'm going tell you guys why I wasn't in the documentary it's a very simple reason and uh I cannot stress this point enough the only reason that I didn't do it was because and it's very important I don't know this  at all I don't know anything I don't know anything that they don't tell me about I don't hang out with this  nothing so what the  do I got to be in the documentary for this guy R Kelly got another sex tape out now can't believe that  this guy makes more sex tapes than he does music he's like the DJ College of sex tapes another one like damn it's a lot of tapes the new one's so bad that they didn't even show it I've never seen anything like this the prosecutor in Chicago came out in a press conference and read to the media a transcript of a sex tape have you ever heard of such thing this  read the sex tape and it was so bad that R Kelly sounded guilty in the transcripts It's  amazing 16 times the girls age was mentioned ain't that crazy this  is an idiot he was  like yeah this is the best 14-year-old  I've ever had in my life and she was like you like this 14  like oh yeah I love this 14 I'm like man you need to shut the  up you got to give your lawyer something to work with you supposed to be on the tape like this is the best 36y old  I've ever had in my life and then your La going to be like your honor clearly my client thought that this woman was 36 as he mentioned some 16 times in the tape they going to know you lying though you know what I mean everybody knows no such thing is good 36 year old   then matter what I say and if you at home watching this  on Netflix remember  you clicked on my face I just remember all the comedians really like that joke and there was an older comedian and he came to me one night after the show after he saw the joke and he said listen I got an audition at another comedy club and I was wondering do you mind if I do that joke I just I just want to borrow it now I'm a kid I don't know any better I'm like borrow it well I guess sure if it'll help your career I let him do the joke and then weeks later I was waiting to go on in the comedy club and he went on before me and he did the joke and after the show I pulled him aside and I said hey man I don't mind you borrowing my jokes but you got to give them back he said oh I forgot to ask you we go goes let me buy that joke from you for $50 and I said man I do it but I'm just starting out I need all the material I can get the idea being that the more material I can accumulate the faster I'll be able to make money for my work I said I can't do it I want my joke back I'll never forget this remember I was a 15-year-old child this guy was a grown ass man he stood up over me so I could see how big he was and he said to me really I can just take it and he did I got scared CU I was a child but I never forgot that I never forgot that I was 15 years old I'm 47 now I think about this guy all the time when I look at my own kids and I see how young and innocent they are I can't believe someone did that to me and I don't think about it every day because that was the worst thing that happened to me I think about it every day because that was the first time that someone ever did that to me but in my career it has happened many many times since when someone would intimidate me or scare me and take something that I believe was mine tell you another story now I'm 18 years old I'm living in New York City and I just finished my first road tour which was a very difficult tour I'll spare you the details now I'm back in New York but my rent is paid thank God and I have $60 to my name and a woman that I met in Pittsburgh a bad Dominican  was coming to New York she was going to spend the weekend with me I couldn't wait for her to get there she was coming that evening remember I only had $60 for a whole weekend to entertain a bad  now I'm walking through grenwich Village and I see something I've never seen before three card Monty you know what that is yeah the guy had the whole thing the table was set up and he had the three cards and crowd was hooting and hollering and he was like find the red card find the red card and people were playing sometimes they win sometimes they lose but it was really exciting and I'm standing there watching it and I noticed while I'm watching them play this game that the red card the one you're trying to find and just a little bend on the corner and I'm watching and I'm like yo this guy doesn't seem to know that red card is bent I'm going to beat this  and I walked up to the table and I said let me play a hand and I put my last $60 on that table and he starts to shuffle and find the red card find the red card and I kept watching that bent card go around the table make sure I kept my eyes on that bent card and when he stopped shuffling and he said find the red card I pointed to it with confidence here it is right here here and he flipped it over and it was black and he took my money I couldn't  believe that how did this  do that was that Magic or sorcery I was confused so you know what I did I sat there and I watched them for a real long time play the game and I realized that all those people who was doing all that hooting and hollering and betting my God they were his friends they were in on the whole thing I felt so wrong I felt so stupid and then the next sucker came up to the table and was about to put his money down and I said  that man don't put your money there all these  is in on it it's a trick and when I said that the guy that was dealing and this  was huge snatched me up by my collar feel how strong he was when he grabbed me I was a skinny little guy and he was going to Maul me the only reason he didn't I'm sure is because he saw the fear in my face and that fear he looked at me I saw his eyes go from hard to soft he soften then he looked at me like the way I father would look at a child and he said to me young man don't ever come between a man and his meal I never forgot that either most  would have to run the streets for years to learn a lesson that profound it took me two seconds never get between somebody and their paper taking a man's livelihood away from him is akin to killing him do you know why Prince the famous rock star that was a friend of mine do you know why he called himself the artist when he came back he calls himself the artist because that's what they call us in our contracts oh these contracts are crazy you should hear the terminology they say in these contracts to you your name and likeness and perpetuity throughout the Universe who the  could possibly know what that means nobody does it's so complicated in fact that when you're a kid like me you have to hire somebody to tell you what that means and you sit down at a table and you do the contract game that's how I got with Comedy Central I signed the contract but I signed the contract the way that a 28-year-old expecting father that was broke signs a contract I was desperate I needed a way out and it wasn't good money and it wasn't good circumstances but what else am I going to do I said and all these white people sitting at that table told me trust us Dave it's a good contract and I looked around the table and they all seemed to agree it was a good contract but what if what if it was like that game of three card Monty what if they were all friends and I didn't know it and the bag of money was icebergs money in the first place what was I talking about what was I trying to tell you last week two weeks ago whenever it was I call on Michael and I tell them okay I'll do it I'll do Saturday Night Live on Election night and and the day I made that phone call the day I committed to it it gets announced that Netflix is streaming Chappelle Show not just Netflix HBO Max is streaming it too tell you another story about HBO no hear me out did you know before Chappelle show was at Comedy Central I pitched that show to HBO I I told them what I wanted to do now these are Executives all they have to do is say yeah we'll take it or no thank you we won't but they didn't say either of those things they went too far they said literally what do we need you for that's what they told me is that kick me out of the office what do we need you for and here we are all these years later and they're streaming the very show that I was pitching to them so I'm asking them what do you need me  for people think I made a lot of money for Chappelle Show when I left that show I never got paid they didn't have to pay me because I signed the contract but is that right I found out that these people were streaming my work and they never had to ask me or they never had to tell me perfectly legal cuz I signed the contract but is that right I didn't think so either that's why I like working for Netflix I like working for Netflix because when all those bad things happened to me that company didn't even exist and when I found out they were streaming Chappelle Show I was Furious how could they not how could they not know so you know what I did I called them and I told them that this makes me feel bad and do you want to know what they did they agreed that they would take it off their platform just so I could feel better that's why I  with Netflix because they paid me my money they do what they say they're going to do and they went above and beyond what you could expect from a businessman they did something just because they thought that I might think that they were wrong and I I do I think if if you are  streaming that show you're fencing stolen goods they stole that from me they just took it and I'm not up here trying to tell you guys that I believe that ComEd Central gave me a raw deal just because I'm black I believe that they gave me a raw deal because this  industry is a monster it's the same monster that these me too  was trying to tell you about but they hate the monster for how it  and I hate that monster for how it eats but my God man it's the same monster when I quit the show all my friends would say well  them da why don't you just do Chappelle Show at another Network yeah yeah yeah and why doesn't a slave run from One Plantation to another Plantation because the master over there might be nicer my God man I was trapped you know what tell you the truth tell you the truth I even thought about coming back and doing another Chappelle Show well but if I do I can't call it Chappelle Show because my name and likeness is being used by them in perpetuity throughout the Universe it's in the contract  you're not supposed to do this in my business I'm up here doing something that nobody else in his business has the balls to do I'm telling you something that you need to know I'm trying to explain to you what you're seeing you don't understand what you're seeing I am public flogging a network and I know that this network  they they watching me and they saying why why why are you doing this so so publicly do feel good to be fogged publicly oh believe me I know I know exactly how that feels when I quit my show they said I was crazy who was crazy about it I just didn't want to do it anymore they said I smoked crap that's impossible I was a devout Muslim I didn't smoke or drink but I do now  cuz you ruined my  life now it's their turn this is their first  lesson and I'm honored to give it to him they're going to pay me for this show I called my agent I said is there anything I can do about this show and he said no well  you do that if you want something done right I guess you got to do it yourself so I'm not going to the agents I'm coming to my real boss I'm coming to you I'm begging you if you ever liked me if you ever think there was anything worthwhile about me I'm begging you please don't watch that show I'm not asking to boycott any network boycott me boycott Chappelle Show do not watch it unless they pay  me if you're a shareholder at Viacom then I'm talking to you because all that  that they do to us well they do everything for their shareholders that's what they told me so if you're a shareholder in that company tell them it's wrong and if you don't believe that it's wrong then  you too should know what's in the hot dogs you eat now there's probably a bunch of people at Comedy Central and Viacom and all these places that have no idea what I'm talking about they've all either quit or been fired or got me toed or something them

I will I'll do it for free chicken it's least I can do they make fun of Latin people for eating uh what y'all eat beans rice corn listen that's not a reason to hate a  all right it's funny but it's not a reason to hate the only reason these things are even issue is because nobody knows what white people eat you've been very good at keeping that  a secret amongst yourselves I study white people you don't know that I'm writing a paper on you not even for school  just to do it just get I'm doing this independent research I'm spending my money that's why I'm working so hard I follow you around

know what you drink see how quiet I got grape juice surprise  you didn't know I knew about grape juice did you oh don't play dumb with me look what a lot of black people don't have the privilege of knowing about grape juice because they have grape drink it's not the same formula that you give ain't no vitamins in that  you might have one of your black friends over Todd Todd would you care for a glass of grape juice what  what the  is juice I want some grape drink baby it's purple I don't think I know what a grape drink is what I have some apple juice if you want what the  is juice I want

stopped smoking weed with black people you didn't let me finish  godamn I'm sorry black people to break the news so publicly but I can't smoke with you anymore every time I smoke weed with my black friends all you talk about is your trials and tribulations I'm sick of that  I got my own problems  that's a waste of weed I'm smoking weed to run away from my problems not take on yours from now on I smoke weed exclusively with white people calm down  you went by default you got good weed conversation all white people talk about when they get high is other times that they got high I can listen to that  all night dude remember Frank's last week  smashed man and catalogs everything they drink two shots Jagger kill four bong hitsman Beer Cheeseburger that  is great only bad part is you cannot pass out around white people every time white dudes pass out around each other they always do some borderline gay  when the gu asleeping Frank fell asleep so he like stuck a carrot in his ass and put shaving cream on his balls like why  why would you do that to a friend of yours he trusted you enough to sleep around you going to put a carrot in his ass is that is that nice I tell you right now if I put a carrot in a black dude a  will kill you when he wakes up for some  like that that is an automatic death sentence on the street SRA for you I'm going to kill that  I thought y'all was friends baby what happened I I I fell asleep in this house right we was drinking and I fell asleep at this house and and while I was sleeping right I'm just going to kill that  all right that's all you need to know  carrots but everybody's getting along I see that  I see it all around blacks and whites don't fight so much you know who don't have no beef with anybody's Asian people I see how y'all be doing y'all just lay in the cut only time only people Asian people beef with is other Asian people like if you call a Korean guy Chinese I've done this they'll flip out hey what make you think I'm Chinese I am Korean I look Chinese yes  you do look Chinese that's why I said it it's an accident n to the untrained ey you all look Chinese to me it's a mistake I'm not trying to offend you some people say all black people look alike we don't get bent out of shape we normally just call those people police okay just learn to live with it that's all I can tell you everybody's afraid of police man scared to death of these police I am  I got a police scanner first first first money I got this the first  I went out bought me a police can I just listen to these  before I go out just to make sure everything's cool you hear  on it calling all CS calling all CS be on the lookout for a blackmail between 47 and 68 staying in the crib tonight  that got to work on that alibi for a minute every black person needs a alibi I I do them impromptu joints if I'm by myself and need I I'll just open up the window windows in the apartment turn all lights on stop beating off right in the window look at me hey everybody look it's me they should pay Praise Him jerking off Note the time  it's 2:35 look at me I'm jerking off from the window 235 comedian dayel is June 10th note the time that  could save my life officer David Chappelle couldn't have done that I saw him in his window masturbating from 235 to 237 I'm certain of it he was standing on a clock and holding a calendar and today's paper  I need a alibi I can't be no celebrity this  is just the worst I'm seeing it I can see why I see why stars are crazy now these  I went to Disney World with my kids which is a big deal for me I don't get to see my kids so much I do Chappelle Show 20 hours a day sleep for like half an hour raise my kids for 10 20 minutes and I go back to work now this particular day I got to hook up with the kids we went to Disney World everybody at the park  everybody hey hey Rick James  hey I'm Rick James  it's like hey man hey you mind not calling me a  in front of my kids time out  we take a day off even Mickey Mouse did it I said this is the most unprofessional  I have ever seen in my life rck James  oh I was fed up I caught that  with a uppercut B knocked his head clean off everybody was screaming oh my God oh my God Mickey Mouse is  Mexican  I had a terrible time in Disney World Disney World is like a whole another country anyway they got their own currency that  is ridiculous soon as I check in the hotels welcome to Disney World Mr Chappelle can we interest you in some Disney Dollars n man I'm cool can't buy weed and  with Disney dolls  I'm on vacation I like them green backs I like them green back you know what I'm saying the kind of money people spend people very particular about that I saw that that was one of the main stories from the war was the first big thing we did was they said now that Iraq has been liberated we have managed to take Saddam Hussein's face off of the money and I'm not going to lie when that press conference came off I was like choked up I was I was actually proud of being an American because that is a very subtle psychological Nuance of Oppression to have a dictator on your money and it's thoughtful to be able to take that  off for the Goodwill of another person right but then I thought well if you could do that for Iraq what about our money man our money look like baseball cars with slave owners on George Washington is the worst of the worst yes I said it you mythologize this  like he was the greatest dude man if I went back in time with a white person and we saw George Washington walking in front of our time machine my white friend would probably be like oh my God Dave look there's George Washington it's the father of this great nation I'm going to go shake his hand I'd be on the other side like run  George Washington and we' both be right you like him because he wrote the Declaration of Independence and all that  we hold these truths to be self-evident all men are created equal go get me a sandwich  I'll kill you Liberty Justice for All Am I Wrong Am I Wrong wait a minute did he not own slaves didn't he own slaves that's my that's all I'm saying I almost protested the war in the beginning almost till I saw what happened to them Dixie Chicks I said  that if they'll do that to three white women they will te my black ass to pieces I don't want to hear that  Yeah man they would but I'm like for real why why you care so much with the Dixie Chicks say they not like they political scientists or nothing they just  that can sing good you know what I mean stop worshiping celebrity so much just don't let don't pay attention why people listen to me I'll say anything  I've done commercials for Coke and Pepsi I don't give a  what comes out of my mouth I just say What It Takes whatever it takes that's what I'm saying if you want to know the truth can't even taste the difference surprise all I know was Pepsi paid me most recently so taste better it's pretty much how the game goes I'm just being real man it's too much goo gag and over celebrities people don't know what's fake and what's real anymore that's why Bill Cosby got in trouble look what happened to Bill Cosby Bill Cosby said some real  and the whole world freaked out on them for what for having an opinion just because they was selling putting pops for the last 40 years people forget that he's a  from Philly in the projects and he might say some real  from time to time it's not that big of a deal I spoke at my old high school and I told them kids straight up if you guys are serious about making it out of this ghetto you got to focus you got to stop blaming white people for your problems and you you've got to learn how to rap or play basketball or something  you're trapped you are trapped either do that or sell crack that's your only options that's the only way I've ever seen it work you better get to entertaining these white people  get to dancing go on out there and be  somebody I just hope they  listened  is ridiculous people worship television they worship this  you know like if you watch a movie right say you watching a movie and one character says to another character say hey uh what's your number man what's the other character always say 555 5555 you know why we got to do that because stupid ass people go to the movies and then go home and try to call the characters that they just saw hello is Indiana Jones here no  he's fake it's not his number and to be honest this the worst time in history to be a black celebrity  they locking all our Stars up it's hot right now for black celebrities I knew it was bad when Kobe got in trouble I said this is a rap for us he's one of the most wholesome dudes we had lock them ups and everything Kobe kept it together thank God he he held his game together because if he was cracking under pressure and getting like six points a game the whole would have been like that  is guilty Kobe was playing his ass off he was playing like his freedom dependent on that  you see this  them games this  trying to beat that case on the court like the judge s the ball like play for your freedom  if I could talk to coab bch like just relax you'll be fine man cuz the public is still giving Kobe the benefit of the doubt he's one of the few black celebrities that get that not cuz he's a celebrity more because you know the girl showed up with eight different seamons to the investigation you can't do that that's seven too many that's a lie of seing man this  got noark on a panties like what you trying to recreate Humanity or she's a collector she got every unsolved mystery the answer might be in this girl's pain that's the first place I look OJ's other gloves in there Bigfoot's footprint three CSI reruns in that  you got the most diabolical draws ever  being a celebrity this is not the time to be a black star they locking all our cars up black celebrities this is a Witch Hunt For Us man God damn it it's all OJ's fault ever since OJ Got Away white people have just been locking up our Stars one by one it's true and it's all it's not even OJ's fault it's our fault we celebrated too openly when OJ got AC quitted we should have been quiet about that  soon as a not guilty  name oh in your face  in your face hurts don't it it hurts Burns do it  oh that justice system burns doesn't it welcome to my world  all that  white people wanted OJ's ass bad City LA spent over $12 million just trying that  and the look on white people's face when he was acquitted Priceless prices and that's why I don't trip off being a celebrity I don't like it I don't trust it there one minute they all love you and the next thing you know in front of that Courthouse dancing on top of a car just trying to figure out what the  happened to you what's what I'm waiting for cuz the timing of this Michael Jackson  is what makes me doubt it every time there's war is going out of control or the economy gets bad or something is wrong with The World At Large it's always these moments in history that Michael Jackson will coincidentally jerk off a kid this is getting ridiculous like are you planning this  do you have meetings Michael thank you for coming as you know Michael the war has not been going as well as we expected there's been a lot of hiccups and the public is asking us a lot of questions of course and well Michael there's no nice way to say this and all I know how to do is be direct so let me just be direct we're going to need you to jerk off another child Mike I'm sorry I am sorry but it would really help out or maybe he didn't who knows who knows that's the thing that's what I wanted to say who knows who the  knows Mike God and this little boy know that's that's about it it's about it only reason that I can even talk about this  is because everybody is speculating they all think he did it and I don't think he did it I'm alone in this I don't think he did it I'm not g to say I don't think he did it that's too strong let me just say I am reserving judgment until all the facts come out but so far from what I heard I mean the kid said he's d of cancer he was in Make A Wish Foundation he claims he had two weeks to live and it was his dang wish to meet Michael Jackson come on man give me a  break this kid is 10 years old he don't remember Thriller the  he want to meet Michael Jackson for honestly I remember Thriller and I just like kind of want to meet this  like I wouldn't break an appointment to meet him I put it that way I'd have to already be free that's ridiculous it's like if I'm dying in two weeks and go oh mama oh get me in the room with chubby chuckle I wouldn't want to meet that  not my last two weeks why not Usher or somebody like this so then the kid claims he goes to Michael's house this is where it all gets crazy I don't like you know he does everything you'd expect at Michael's house they uh climbed trees and Rod roller coasters and Ferris wheels the chef made cookies pies and cakes they was petting a monkey and the giraff sing songs kid  and in the middle of all this childlike activity for some reason Mike pulled out some wine and some pills and suck this kid's dick folks it hurts me to say it and the kid had the nerve to call that abuse  that is a good host God damn what else do you want what else do you want I'm lucky to get a glass of of GRA drink in my friend's house on road coaster riding my dick sucked Mike must be confused like I brought you in my house I fed you I sucked your dick and this is how you repay me  this was your wish not  man thought you were dying in two weeks what happened to that  I've been in court for a year and a half you get strong every time I see  you would this is  though I shouldn't even say  wouldn't be some ironic  if they found out through this case that the cure for cancer was Michael Jackson sucking your dick somehow like if Mike had powers like Green Mile and all the kids was like please Mike Su got X never again he didn't appreciate it can we at least study your saliva m- please Mike this just doesn't stop though just doesn't stop and the only reason I can talk about Mike is cuz he's a freak he is a freak that's why people let you talk about cuz if I brought up Catholic priest  kids it'll get quiet as  but but when Michael Jackson does it it's okay because he's a freak his face is all cut up but just remember when you look at that thing that he calls his face that he did that for you somehow somehow he thought you might maybe it'll help maybe people will like me more you know what I said that's all I said first of all I'll tell you right now what I said uh and I will tell you that this was not a joke it's a true story and I just happened to tell it all right what happened was I went to a gallery party all right I don't know who in here has ever been Rich before but these are very nice parties uh you know wine and cheese and ball of conversation and there was a few eccentric types one of which was a very wealthy man that happened to be wearing a dress I don't know what you call man this is a  or drag queen perhaps whatever it was it's definitely a man and this man was definitely on drugs I don't know what kind of drugs it's on but I knew he had too much he didn't look good like this he's like ah he look sick and all his friends was standing around him concerned trying to revive him I don't know what it looked like some kind of gay CPR was Fanning and   I saw all this from a distance now I should have minded my own business but I got curious I was like and I went over there all I said I said excuse me gentlemen gentlemen is he okay and then they looked at me like I was evil she is fine say word oh I'm sorry I didn't know this what we were doing um here's my thing I support anybody's right to be whoever they feel like they are inside I'm your ally in that however my question is to what degree do I have to participate in your self-image is it fair that I have to change my whole pronoun game up for this  that didn't make sense seriously if I put on an argal sweater and I'm like hey everybody I feel like a white guy in the sweater and I want some goddamn respect in a bank loan that's not going to work give a  how I feel why I I give a  how you feel  is a pronoun but there was no time for pH opical debate this was an emergency situation I said fine sorry guys I was just worried because because she looks terrible she just fell off the bench appears that her dick is popping out of her dress mind if I call an ambulance champ I'd rather not be at a party where Tran OD there too many questions to answer  okay I've been through this before I had a friend from high school now in high school this guy was a thug right he was a  dope boy he did it all he's a wild dude people used to be very scared of him and then after high school word on the street was he'd come out the classet I personally didn't believe it I bring him up because last year he calls me out of the blue like yo what's up man I got your number from so and so I heard you going to be in New York doing a show can I get some tickets I was like  yeah get some tickets man how you been he said well we'll catch up at the show man but yo I'm appreciate it I'll see you soon I said all right man take care and I was about to hang up and I couldn't resist I was just like hey  I heard you was gay what's going on with that and I wish I didn't ask cuz he sound like he was dying to talk about that  and he had a long story about it and it's not that I didn't care but I was you know I don't like talking on the phone I was watching TV at the same time so I just wasn't really paying attention like I should but I was trying to sound supportive but I didn't really know what to say so I just like mumbling  throughout this conversation I just be like you know  you gay man you just gay like this went on for a while and then finally I had to say something like definitive to get him off the phone and I was like hey man you know what don't let people get you down all right and uh the next time someone tries to make you feel bad about yourself just remember everybody  funny to somebody he didn't like that  he's like what the  does that mean I said huh he said you saying I  funny  I said no that's not what I'm saying I'm saying everybody's different he say you ain't say different  you say you say it funny what's so  funny about the way I  and I said hey man I  feet he said what oh this is not a joke ladies and gentlemen I get women to squeeze their feet together like this and I  them right in that little space in their feet but you can't build a community behind that  there's no flag for us that  made him laugh and the next day after the show I saw him backstage he was like yo what's up man I'm like oh  what's going on and he had his buddy with him he goes day want you meet Manuel Manuel's my fiance we're in New York getting married cuz it's legal here I said oh oh well uh congratulations fellas and Manuel was like gracias and he went to go get some drinks and then my buddy looked at me he was like so Dave what do you think and I started mumbling again you gay  you know just gay uh said yeah I'm a little nervous about getting married man it's a big step I said yeah it is big step he said well you've been married for a while you got any advice for us no I'm married to a woman sorry about that and they corrected me he said no you married the person that you love so it's essentially the same I said you know man uh the problem with that statement is that it makes the assumption that I love her but you guys lighting the  up of course I love my wife she laughs at this  as a matter of fact she eats and Spins this  you know what I told him I told I told him I said you know what you should do man first of all you should you shouldn't do it uh I'm talking about being legally married it's not that you're gay as much as just legal marriage is a  diabolical leverage game in the United States I'm just being honest the void of religious significance or the idea of Love marriage is nothing but an awful contract that you shouldn't sign just being real cuz you start out loving each other and then like two years later you just building a case against one another for a hypothetical court date that may or may not ever happen you thr being gay on top of that that  is explosive like it's that Ray Rice  okay right after Ray Rice went through all that  I was at a party and I met this kid Michael Sams you know Michael Sams very nice guy he's the first openly gay NFL player and Mike is very nice guy very brave guy but when I met him I couldn't help but thinking now what's going to happen when Michael Sams beats his wife up in the elevator is that domestic violence or is that just two  working  out in the elevator you know what I  mean anyway I give all married men the same advice gay or straight get a dog this dog will love you all the time but she's not going to it's real talk I didn't even I didn't even know about dogs and my kids kid got the dog they brought him home from the shelter and I didn't even want him they like can we keep him I said nope I said where' you even get this dog they're like we got him from the shelter I was like e probably something wrong with them can't keep them and then my kids started crying and screaming like the dog had gambling Debs please Dad if you don't let us keep him they're going to kill him I said all right you can keep him and his dog was a menace I hated his guts then one night I smoked a bunch of weed and I was eating a sandwich and Baba came over Baba's a dog he came over was staring at me this will make you very uncomfortable if he just looking at you I had to give him a piece of my sandwich so he go away and that's how we became friends now if you see me walking down the street with I ain't got no leash or nothing he walks right next to me if I if I stop he'll stop and if I go he'll go and all my friends like yo Dave that  is dope how you train Baba to do that  H I've never trained Baba just a Messy eater if I drop food and Baba's not around all I got to do is call him Baba he's a black dude's dog so he doesn't come right away he Peaks first to see what's going on I got to tap my foot so he can see the food over here little buddy

never seen Indians before I wasn't even sure if they were Indians it's  up but I I asked one of them it's not nice but I seen him in the sports section looking at bows and arrows I had to say something excuse  me I I don't mean to be rude um are you an Indian and he was cool yes yeah same Indian still didn't believe him I had to test him to be sure this is  up but I had a gum wrapper in my pocket so I bowled that  up and I threw it on the floor and a single tear came out his ey I said oh  I had so many questions what tribe are you from I am a novel ho I said word I studied you in social studies you're a hunter gatherer correct he said I guess so that's what you wish to call it I said why what do you call it he said I am an  alcoholic I said well what's your name dog he said please

beautiful it was just like I dream was was all sitting around them Indians was beating the drum some other Indians came out the back with a long blanket that was folded in half and put in in front of us open that  up and on the blanket was a long wooden pipe with feathers and bags of weed were all over the blanket Chief walked over the big ones are 50 the little ones are 25 and these are 10 man those Indians got high as  I was B I told the chief he was talking I cut him off time out Chief sorry to interrupt  smash man the weed is too strong I'm itching this this PCP  the spirits have got me Chief the spirits have got me and the chat threw some water in my face calm down black face splash I said hey it's black feet  take it easy black feet you're welcome to stay amongst Me and My Tribe for the night until the spirits leave you and they gave me my own tee to sleep in which sounds nice I personally felt like it was a little  up you know cuz they all had houses man it's like why can't I sleep with y'all in the house and watch TV  I can't be on this grass ass all night the Indians is rude man everybody's rude Indians they eat nasty food all they ate was corn and  Doritos I think they called them that's right people only see the surface they see the division in our Foods it's cuz I eat Chicken and watermelon they think that that's something wrong with me let me tell you something if you don't like chicken or watermelon something is wrong with you  there's something wrong with you where are all these people that don't like Chicken and watermelon I'm sick of hearing about how bad it is it's great I'm waiting for chicken to approach me to do a commercial  I will I'll do it for free chicken this least I can do they make fun of Latin people for eating uh what y'all eat beans rice corn listen that's not a reason to hate a  all right it's funny but it's not a reason to hate the only reason these things are even an issue is because nobody knows what white people eat you've been very good at keeping that  a secret amongst yourselves I study white people you don't know that I'm writing a paper on you not even for school  just to do it just get doing his independent research I'm spending my money that's why I'm working so hard I follow you around grocery stores they freak out I just try to peek in the car they always see get away from my car  what are you looking at chicken and giblets are over there you must be lost these are vegetables I know what you drink see how quiet it got grape juice surprise  you didn't know I knew about grape juice did you oh don't play dumb with me looking a lot of black people don't have the privilege of knowing about grape juice because they have grape drink it's not the same formula that you give ain't no vitamins in that  you might have one of your black friends over Todd Todd would you care for a glass of grape juice what  what the  is juice I want some grape drink baby M it's purple I don't think I know what a grape drink is what I have some apple juice if you want what the  is juice I want some apple drink scream remember that commercial for Sunny Delight when all the kids run in from outside playing they all run to the fridge all right I got some purple stuff some Sunny D soon as he say Sunny D all the kids go yeah watch the black kid in the back if you ever see that commercial again look at that black kid he be like I want that purple stuff I that's drink  that is drink they want they want drink want all them vitamins  I would drink sugar water purple that's the ingredient sugar water and of course purple it's too  much I got a lot of things to talk about tonight first of all I've stopped smoking weed with black people you didn't let me finish  godamn I'm sorry black people to to break the news so publicly but I can't smoke with you anymore every time I smoke smoke weed with my black friends all you talk about is your trials and tribulations I'm sick of that  I got my own problems  that's a waste of weed I'm smoking weed to run away from my problems not take on yours from now on I smoke weed exclusively with white people calm down  you went by default you got good weed conversation all white people talk about when they get high is other times that they got high I can listen to that  all night dude remember Franks last week  smashed man and catalogs everything they drink two shots Jagger te Killa four bong hitsman Beer Cheeseburger that  is great only bad part is you cannot pass out around white people every time white dudes pass out around each other they always do some boorder land gay  when the guy's asleep Frank fell asleep so he like stuck a carrot in his ass and put shaving cream on his balls like why  why would you do that to a friend of yours he trusted you enough to sleep around you going to put a carrot in his ass is that is that nice I tell you right now if I put a Caren a black dud a  will kill you when he wakes up for some  like that that is an automatic death sentence on the street SRA for you I'm going to kill that  I thought y'all was friends baby what happened I I I fell asleep at his house right we was drinking and I fell asleep at this house and and while I was sleeping right I'm just going to kill that  all right that's all you need to know  carrots but everybody's getting along I see that  I see it all around blacks and whites don't fight so much you know who don't have no beef with anybody's Asian people I see how y'all be doing y'all just lay in the cut only time only people Asian people beef with is other Asian people like if you call a Korean guy Chinese I've done this they'll flip about hey what make you think of Chinese I am Korean I look Chinese yes  you do look Chinese that's why I said it it's an accident  to the untrained ey you all look Chinese to me it's a mistake I'm not trying to offend you some people say all black people look alike we don't get been out of shape we normally just call those people police okay just learn to live with with it that's all I can tell everybody's afraid of police though scared to death of these police I am  I got a police scanner first first money I got this the first  I went out bought me a police scanner I just listen to these  before I go out just to make sure everything's cool you hear  on it calling all cars calling all cars be on the lookout for a blackmail between 47 and 68 staying in the crib tonight  that got to work on that alibi for a minute every black person needs an alibi I I do them impr promp to joints if I'm by myself and need out I'll just open up the windows in the apartment turn on the lights on stop beating off right in the window look at me hey everybody look it's me they should P I'm crazy him jerking off Note the time  it's 2:35 look at me I'm jerking off in the window 2:35 comedian days palis June 10th note the time that  could save my life officer David Chappelle couldn't have done that I saw him in his window masturbating from 235 to 237 I'm certain of it he was standing on a clock and holding a calendar and today's paper  I need a alibi I can't be no celebrity this  is just the worst I'm seeing it I can see why I see why stars are crazy now these  I went to Disney World my kids which is a big deal for me I don't get to see my kids so much I do Chappelle Show 20 hours a day sleep for like half an hour raise my kids for 10 20 minutes and I go back to work now this particular day I got to hook up with the kids we went to Disney World everybody at the park  everybody hey hey Rick James  hey I'm Rick James  it's like hey man hey you mind not calling me a  in front of my kids time out  we take a day off even Mickey Mouse did it I said this is the most unprofessional  I have ever seen in my life brick James  oh I was fed up I caught that  with the uppercut Bop knocked his head clean off everybody screaming oh my God oh my God Mickey Mouse is  Mexican I had a terrible time in Disney World Disney World is like a whole another country anyway they got their own currency that  is ridiculous soon as I checked in the hotels welcome to Disney World Mr Chappelle can we interest you in some Disney Dollars no man I'm cool can't buy weed and  with Disney Dollars  I'm on vacation I like them green backs I like them green bag you know what I'm saying the kind of money people spend people very particular about that I saw that that was one of the main stories from the war was the first big thing we did was they said now that Iraq has been liberated we have managed to take Saddam Hussein's face off of the money and I'm not going to lie when that press conference came off I was like choked up I was I was actually proud of being an American because that is a very subtle psychological Nuance of Oppression to have a dictate on your money and it's thoughtful to be able to take that  off for the Goodwill of another person right but then I thought well if you could do that for Iraq what about our money man our money look like baseball cars with slave owners going George Washington is the worst of the worst yes I said it you mythologize this  like he was the greatest dude man if I went back in time with a white person and we saw George Washington walking in front of our time machine my wife friend will probably be like oh my God Dave look there's George Washington's the father of this great nation I'm going to go shake his hand I'd be on the other side like run  George Washington and we'd both be right you like him because he wrote the Declaration of Independence and all that  we hold these truths to be self-evident all men are created equal go get me a sandwich  I'll kill you Liberty Justice for All Am I Wrong Am I Wrong wait a minute did he not own slaves didn't he own slaves that's my that's all I'm saying I almost protested the war and begin almost till I saw what happened to them Dixie Chicks I said  that if they'll do that to three white women they will tear my black ass to pieces I don't want to hear that  Yeah man they would but I'm like for real why why you care so much what the Dixie Chicks say they not like they political scientists or nothing they just  that can s good you know what I mean stop worshiping celebrities so much just don't just don't pay atten I I remember right around September 11th J Rule was on MTV that's what they say we got J Ru on the phone let's see what jaw's thoughts are on this tragedy who gives a  with J Rule thanks at a time like this  this is ridiculous I don't want to dance I'm scared to death I want some answers that J Ru might not have right now think when bad  happens to me I'll be in the crib like oh my God this is terrible cuz somebody please find J Rule get hold of this  so I can make sense of all this where is J me J R I don't even know why people listen to me I'll say anything  I've done commercials for Coke and Pepsi I don't give a  what comes out of my mouth I just say What It Takes whatever it takes that's what I'm saying if you want to know the truth can't even taste the difference surprise all I know was Pepsi pavy most recently so taste better it's pretty much how the game goes I'm just being real man it's too much goo gag and over celebrities people don't know what's fake and what's real anymore that's why Bill Cosby got in trouble look what happened to Bill Cosby Bill Cosby said some real  and whole world freaked out on for what for having an opinion just because they've been selling putting pops for the last 40 years people forget that he's a  from Philly in the projects and he might say some real  from time to time it's not that big of a deal I spoke at my old high school and I told them kids straight up if you guys are serious about making it out of this ghetto you got to focus you got to stop blaming white people for your problems and you you've got to learn how how to rap or play basketball or something  you're trapped you are trapped either do that or sell crack that's your only option that's the only way I've ever seen at work better get to entertaining these white people  get to  dancing go on out there and be  somebody I just hope they listened  is ridiculous people worship television they worship this  you know like if you watch a movie right say you watching a movie and one character says to another character say hey uh what's your number man what's the other character always say 555 5555 you know why we got to do that because stupid ass people go to the movies and then go home and try to call the characters that they just saw hello is Indiana Jones here no  he's fake it's not his number and to be honest this the worst time in history to be a black celebrity  they locking all our Stars up it's hot right now for black cies I knew it was bad when Kobe got in trouble I said this is a rap for us he's one of the most wholesome dudes we had lock them ups and everything and Kobe kept it together thank God he he held his game together because if he was cracking under pressure getting like six points a game the whole La would have been like that  is guilty there Kobe was playing his ass off he was playing like his freedom dependent on that  you see this  them games this nigg trying to beat that case on the court that like the judge thre the ball like play for your freedom  if I could talk to Kobe I'd be like just relax you'll be fine man cuz the public is still giving Kobe the benefit of the doubt he's one of the few black celebrities that get that not cuz he's a celebrity more because you know the girl showed up with eight different Seamans to the investigation you can't do that that's seven too many that's a lot of seing man this  got no arc on a panties like what you trying to recreate Humanity or something she's a collector she got every unsolved mystery the answer might be in this girl's pain that's the first place I look OJ's other glove is in there Bigfoot's footprint three CSI reruns is in that  you got the most diabolical draws ever  being a celebrity this is not the time to be a black star they locking all our Stars up black celebrities this is a Witch Hunt For Us man God damn it it's all OJ's fault ever since OJ Got Away white people have just been locking up our Stars one by one it's true and it's all it's not even OJ's fault it's our fault we celebrated too openly when OJ got acquitted we should have been quiet about that  soon said not guilty  name oh in your face  in your face it hurts don't it it hurts burns doesn't it  oh that justice system burns doesn't it welcome to my world  all that  white people wanted OJ's ass bad City LA spent over $12 million just trying that  and the look on white people's face when he was acquitted Priceless prices and that's why I don't trip off being a celebrity I don't like it I don't trust it there one minute they old love you and the next thing you know in front of that Courthouse dancing on top of a car just trying to figure out what the  happened to  you what's what I'm waiting for cu the timing of this Michael Jackson  is what makes me doubt it every time there's war is going out of control or the economy gets bad or something is wrong with The World At Large it's always these moments in history that Michael Jackson will coincidentally jerk off a kid this is getting ridiculous like are you planning this  do you have meetings Michael thank you for coming as you know Michael the war has not been going as well as we expected there's been a lot of hiccups and the public is asking us a lot of questions of course and well Michael there's no nice way to say this and all I know how to do is be direct so let me just be direct we're going to need you to jerk off another child Mike I'm sorry I am sorry but it would really help out or maybe he did it who knows who knows that's the thing that's what I wanted to say who knows who the  knows Mike God and this little boy know that's that's about it it's about it only reason that I can even talk about this  is because everybody is speculating they all think he did it and I don't think he did it I'm alone in this I don't think he did it I'm not GNA say I don't think he did it that's too strong let me just say I am reserving judgment until all the facts come out but so far from what I heard I mean the kid said he was dying of cancer he was in make A Wish Foundation he claims he had two weeks to live and it was his dying wish to meet Michael Jackson come on man give me a  break this kid is 10 years old he don't remember Thriller the  he want to meet Michael Jackson for honestly I remember Thriller and I just like kind of want to meet this  like I wouldn't break an appointment to meet him I put it that way I'd have to already be free that's ridiculous it's like if I'm dying in two weeks and go oh mama oh get me in the room with chubby Chuck I wouldn't want to meet that  not my last two weeks why not Usher or somebody like this so then the kid claims he goes to Michael's house this is where it all gets crazy I don't like you know he does everything you'd expect at Michael's house they uh climb trees and rode roller coasters and Ferris wheels the chef made cookies pies and cakes they was petting the monkey and the giraffes sing songs kid  and in the middle of all this childlike activity for some reason Mike pulled out some wine and some pills and suck this kid's dick folks it hurts me to say it and the kid had the nerve to call that abuse  that is a good host God damn what else do you want what else do you want I'm lucky to get a glass of of grape drink at my friend's house on a roller coaster rid my dick sucked Mike must be confused like I brought you in my house I fed you I suck your dick and this is how you repay me  this was your wish not  manine thought you were dying in two weeks what happened to that  I've been in court for a year and a half you get stronger every time I see you when that this is  up I shouldn't even say  wouldn't be some ironic  if they found out through this case that the cure for cancer was Michael Jackson sucking your dick somehow like if Mike had powers like Green Mile and all the kids like please Mike Su got X never again he didn't appreciate it can we at least study your saliva please Mike  it just doesn't stop though it just doesn't stop and the only reason I can talk about Mike is cuz he's a freak he is a freak that's why people let you talk about him cuz if I brought up Catholic priest  kids it'll get quiet as  but but when Michael Jackson does it it's okay because he's a freak his face is all cut up but just remember when you look at that thing that he calls his face that he did that for you somehow somehow he thought you might maybe it'll help maybe people will like me more if I turn myself into a white ghoulish like creature I don't know what the  it is but he did it for you and I appreciate the gesture Michael Jackson if you're watching this I appreciate that gesture and I want you to know  everybody Dave Chappelle understands cuz you want to know something I'm getting some work done priz yes nothing major you would never know if I didn't tell you but it's some  I'm insecure about that I want to work on if you must know I'm getting Botox done on my balls to get these wrinkles out finally have these  smooth as eggs no I can't wait I cannot wait and I'm not stopping there that's just phase one baby be like Bob V these old ball I'm fixing them up I'm plucking all the hair out I got to make room I know that's I got to make room I'm going to tattoo a gangster ass face on mean expressions like this then I'll grow the hair back on the bottom so they got beards like me then I'm hitting that beach and looking for ball suckers I'm going wear some high shorts just like this and walk up to women with a confidence I have never had before pardon me Miss I don't mean to be rude but do you suck balls Excuse Me Miss relax you didn't even let me finish do you suck these balls oh my God those balls are as smooth as eggs yes I'll suck them I've played this scenario out in my mind a million times lady that's how it always ends yes I'll suck those balls all our Stars All Our Stars man our Kelly pissed on his victim I know was rough but I mean again I can't even judge R Kelly first of all we don't know if these allegations are true or not and even if they are true if you want to know how I feel about it honestly if a man cannot pee on his fans I don't want to be in show business anymore because well that's why I got in the game baby I got dreams too you guys are confusing the issue why you guys are busy worrying about if R Kelly even peed on this girl or not you're not asking yourself the real question that America needs to decide once and for all and that question is is how old is 15 really oh that's a good question that's a good question I'm not saying that a person is as smart as they're going to be a 15 that's not what I'm saying man but I am saying 15 to me is old enough to decide whether or not you want to be pissed on I mean that's me if you can't make a decision like that by the time you're 15 then just give up  because life is way way harder than that I make tougher decisions all the time if you don't want to get pissed on just get the  out of the way it's not even a decision if I stop peing on the front row they're not going to have to calculate and think how do I feel about this am I okay with it they just move you can do that at 15 I I could have I've been 15 when I was 15 I was doing stand up and nightclubs I smoke rle from time to time friends were selling crack trying to finger  people I knew what was happening around me to some agree getting pissed on was the least of my worries at 15 trust me but it keeps coming up it's a lot of confusion around that age anytime 15 comes up people freak out like when that girl Elizabeth Smart got kidnapped right remember UT told last year 15-y old girl Elizabeth Smart was kidnapped and then they finally found her and the whole country was relieved and I was the only one saying damn she wasn't that smart after all not cuz she got kidnapped that could happen to anybody I'm not knocking her for that I'm just saying if you kidna me when I was 15 you got to take me further than eight miles away from my house man godamn can't hold me prison around  I recognize I'll break away I I'll break away  off me  that's my bus stop I know where I'm at I'm going home she was missing for 6 Months 8 months mil away from a house that's two exits man that's nothing and while she was missing during this half a year that this girl is Missing there's a seven-year-old black girl gets kidnapped in Philadelphia nobody knows her name they might have talked about her two or three times on the news but she should have been the top story because she chewed through the ropes and had both of these  in jail and 45 minutes flat 7 years old I'm not making this up these two crackheads kidnapped her and took her back to the crack house and tied her up and then they left her said crackheads they got to make moves crack smoke chocolate to eat these  made moves that was out but as soon as they left this little girl got the nibb on she was kidnapped at 4:00 and at home watching herself on the news at 5:30 that  is crazy that's a that's a news story that is a news story now meanwhile and you Utah 15-year-old Elizabeth Smart's captives left her alone too and they didn't even Tire up cuz they're Hillbillies they just bounced don't try to escape  or we'll kill you be right back at Le she's 15 sitting in the house by herself how am I going to get out of this come on Elizabeth think think Elizabeth how am I going to get out of here why don't you just open the  door and go outside have you thought about that do you have a quarter do you know your phone number your 15  run stop thinking and stop making moves I know I sound mean and I know what the people are thinking what I'm saying the Dave she is only 15 all right but that's the discrepancy because when you talk about a little girl like Elizabeth Smart then the country feels like 15 is so young and so innocent on the flip side Here Comes 15 again now we talking about a 15-year-old black kid in Florida this black kid accidentally killed his neighbor when he's practicing wrestling moves that he saw on TV now was he a kid no they gave him life they always try our 15y olds as adults this  knew what he was doing it's a goddamn pile driver this kid gets on the ropes there's no stopping him you'd have to send the rock to arrest him and they gave a 15-year-old boy life in jail if you think that it's okay to give him life in jail then it should be legal to pee on him that's all I'm saying you got to make up your mind across the board how old 15 actually is that's all I'm saying so I'm going tell you right now if somebody comes in here and puts a gun in my head and says Chappelle you got a choice to make you're either going to jail for a month or we'll let you go but you got to let R Kelly pee on you I'm not hesitate bring in R Kelly and tell him to stay away from my ass  I'd rather get pissed on on the outside than  the butt on the inside son I can't go to jail with some smooth Botox balls and think everything's going to be all right it's not that kind of place take my chance with that piss piss a wash off with a 10-minute shower I'm certain of it piss coming right out what could I do they're going to put me in jail sad is changing rapidly can't smoke indoors the  is that all about I got kicked out of Teddy ball for smoke no that  was ridiculous the stripper did it the stripper came up like your smoking is a health risk for me I don't want to work in this kind of environment  you have your gner reinfested  in my face you started it they threw me out it's the dirtiest place I've ever been thrown out of and just to give you an idea of what I mean by Dirty LP dances at this place $3 it's  disgusting and at the same time who could pass up a sale son it was $3 of course I did it it's only 12 quars said I'll break a five for that I I've never seen somebody work this hard for $3 this lady must have been a throwback to the Great Depression she was all over me it's the first time I ever told a stripper to get off of me all right yeah thank you very much Miss thank you that'll be all that's enough thank hey hey get off of me whatever happened to lipstick on the caller lady I have a  streak on the middle of my shirt how the  am I going to explain this when I get home huh oh no baby me and Bob were playing basketball and Bob Dunked On Me was hanging on the rim and his pants fell down I was checking him close I think he's swinging and his butt cheeks might uh his butt cheeks I think H my shirt I don't know why I was playing ball in my dress shirt I just was it was midnight I don't know who the  just let me think that's that's when you know a guy's lying if you say  like that hold on just let me think the man have say that to you hold on just let me think for minute can I think y'all wom man you guys you guys made too much progress too fast not too much but you just you're confused by you made so much progress you're even confused men and women we both like what the  just happened CU women got all this money now but they still like women like oh you never take me anywhere anymore and the dud be thinking  you got more money than me you never take me anywhere anymore and at the same time you don't treat a man like a man you don't cook you don't clean and you don't do anything a  says you tell a  what to do I see women doing this to men all the time come  on no man wants that  so when anybody to tell me what to do that much you got to work with me like if it makes a man feel like a man to watch the game then just let him sit there and watch the game for a minute and if he happens to look over at you while he's watching the game don't look at him all mean and make him feel guilty about watching it just pick up your own titty and suck it just try it out he will instantly remember why he fell in

younger when you date a few years younger your friends always say things like young women they can  all night and I'm like cool I can't so you know what else young women can do they can fight all night and they're willing to because they think it matters I need an older woman with a job that depletes her that's what I need comes home after the job just grinds her into a nice salt she just collapses on the couch like don't talk to me and I'm like I won't I'm in bed with this woman she's got the bottle of wine I politely say hey do you mind taking the bottle out of the bed I'm word you

are they going to up the antee in 2024 I'm Stanley Tucci and I'm jerking off on FaceTime to remind you of the importance of this year's election there's two people fighting for free speech right now it's comedians and uh and racists isn't that weird I didn't think we'd be joining forces on a mission but you know it's just weird to see skinhead saying things like we need to protect the First Amendment I'm like I guess I stand with the Aryan Nation it's racist like the first amendment cuz you could say racist  and you get away with it though you know racism is Free Speech the way like a tomato is a fruit technically but if you put it in a fruit salad it is going to  up the rest of the fruit so that's that's an issue I guess it depends who's saying it cuz i' I've had friends of mine call me jewface I'm like yeah whatever and there people I don't know that well call me buddy and I'm like I do not care for that that's that was annoying everyone thinks their free speech is at stake it's not you can say a lot I got a death threat recently I guy just said I want to kill you and I end up having to show it to a cop and the cop goes he said he wants to kill you not that he's going to and I was like yeah but that's an annoying loophole you got to give me that cops said someone do that to me i' kick his  ass I was like cool so you're going to do nothing and call me a  that's fine ser and protect officer ser and protect feels like we're doomed don't you if if there's a God don't you feel like God is up in the sky right now flat screen TV every country's a different Channel I

Messenger not so bad you had to make sure your parents weren't on the phone to cyber bully you know you had to be like Mom get off with Grandma I'm trying to ruin lives okay  it's a bigger it was a bigger deal cyber bullying now I hate when older people are like I used to get the  kicked out of me log off I'm like all right first off it's hard to log off it's very addictive and second off you know who would rather be assaulted than psychologically tormented what would you rather get a wedgie or catfish a black guy will heal you know it won't is uh taking a Greyhound to Syracuse and being like I thought you'd be a woman this sucks God this is the worth 13th birthday ever that joke got sadder and sadder you're the roommates you're the roommates oh hell yeah this dude this dude came

what do you do I'm a real estate agent real estate all right and you and your mom's in real estate too his mom his mom all right what do you do uh I work at Amazon  part of the problem but I do hey wait unless we sell this to Amazon in which case very good people and I'm going to handle this like Trump hey they could be great people we don't know we don't know how they feel about me you have to invite more people than you want here because people just bail these aren't Hamilton tickets this is a rooftop comedy show they're just like oh yeah I don't need to go to that so I just wrote hey mass text anyone want to give me their ton someone just said I can't make it tonight I've got Co the honor code baby was from Puerto Rico yeah you say sure yeah what's up yo P yeah hey py what's up hi what who is this it's Sam oh my God it's Sam  I found out about you during quarantine and you got me through quarantine so it would have been great to meet you oh my God this is so cool you got I got you through quarantine you're meeting me that's like if I met uh Jack Daniels I've been drinking on meds uh I recommend it uh you ever do this Google search how much you could drink on the meds you're on that's a I just go with the article that matches how much I feel like uh like drinking I'm like according the medical journal of guad lahara um I can have as much as I want this is awesome and it's outdoor drinking now this this started as spring break it very quickly became um end of the world Vibes but either way cheers you know I was I was drinking on on the street in this uh neighborhood I was having a drink on the sidewalk and this waitress comes up to me you can't hear a word they're saying cuz this is Manhattan so she she didn't even ask she just does this I was like damn small businesses are getting crushed this sucks now you feel the Divide when you go on the road like I I love going to different parts of the country it's one of my favorite things about America is you know going to like Kentucky place I never would have gone probably and I went to the racetrack in Kentucky which is it's amazing I was I was the worst dressed person there I was the only one who didn't look like a like a villain in Jango Unchained but I walked to the RAC track they all the horses have ridiculous names there's always like one that's a little too crazy they'll be like in third place move moonlit Garden in Second Place Autumn nights and in first place touchy Uncle I'm like wait what was that what was that last one touchy Uncle like the champ that's a I like the South man they they still do civil warry enactments which is kind of weird they're very hung up in that L um they want to talk about it that's that's weird that they do that I asked the guy why do they still do Civil War reenactments he said well they give it gives them a connection to their ancestors like that's not true cuz you would never recreate a fight that you lost right you'd never be like honey remember that time I was wrong invite some friends over let's run it back that would be awesome you ever date someone and you're both in therapy the fights take 10 hours every argument is like I hear you and I appreciate where you're coming from however you're like o that was my whole day I heard a guy in Time Square the other day say to his girlfriend shut up  and I was like that is not okay but he is crushing me in time management you know what women hate when you're when you're arguing they hate when you tell them to calm down so now when she yells at me I say love your energy love what you're doing a little more I'm annoying I repeat myself I said to I was like man I love this Thai restaurant she goes you've told me that three times and I said you're the only person that I hang out with anymore you want to spend all your time with me there's going to be reruns I can't I can't bring it every night that's what a relationship is it's like a TV show where the writing gets progressively worse cuz season one you're like this is good season 3 comes along you're like we should kill off a character we got to keep people engaged here I was on the phone my friend the other day and you ever just not listen and then you guess at the end my friend's like I don't know what to do about her and I was like I think you should  her and he was like my mom I was not present for all of that conversation and I threw a hail Mary I'm not a good partner I'm not I don't I can't date I'm not I don't listen women are always shocked like you're a bad listener I'm like yeah but I speak for a living you should have seen that coming I bet I bet most people are bad at the opposite of their job I bet most terrorists are are shitty Architects you know I bet Bin Laden was a bad city planner you know most audiences laugh at jokes you guys are like we are shocked we are shocked and appalled and then we laugh no man this is uh it's going to be good so I had a uh I had a what M cut out the mic cut out how for how long there go just 4 seconds 4 seconds  just like how I have sex guys 4 seconds then I'm like oh there we go all right well this is a good start um this is it's good when the mic

has happened before you have to hold the mic like this to make sure it's like working the clitoris it's a lot of finesse uh all right there we go how are we now good that's that's a little rough Bobby I don't know if this is this is used to guitars it's not used to a raspy Jew voice so how about now don't mind the uh don't mind the Drone I know you guys when you see eyebrows like this an American drone you don't have long but uh I will say it's going to be okay breakups are painful right cuz your your friends speak to you in cliches my friend was like ah dude it's like a death I was like is it when my grandma died none of my friends were like thank God your grandma was the worst then I was like actually she's going to make it and they're like we always liked her she's a lovely woman oh you guys are snuggled up that's  that's good you got how long you guys been together it must be not that long right cuz that's yeah two years wow good for you don't give him too much credit we're some of us are going through personal things right now and where did you guys meet church church oh my God what the  I guess that's good PR for church you never hear about the adult relationships that come out of there what sorry one of my best friends is a Catholic guy and I give him a ton of  about the pedophilia in the priesthood and he gets so angry the other day he said to me he goes teachers  kids too and I was like I like that angle right there that's good but because I understand what he's saying it's not a problem exclusive to the church but he is making it sound like everyone does it dude why don't you why don't you just back off and I've seen pictures of some of these teachers we it is a different degree of molestation we're talking Top Shelf versus bottom shelf no I'm losing you I've jerked off the teacher porn I've never typed in hot horny Cardinals yes hell yeah thank God for Hawaiian shirk guy I would have been in trouble that dude really carried that joke some of you guys are like we're not so sure he's like I'm all in on this one I too have jerked off to teacher porn teacher porn man that is is that what you go to when you're watching it do you have one yeah gong guy very I got good news for you the internet is loaded with it girl on guy he's like holy  this is I am in luck that's the best fetish to have it's tough after a breakup because I travel a lot and when you travel a lot you think of the person anything goes wrong on a plane I'm like  if anything happens I hope she knows I love her what do you think of as a single guy in that scenario like if this thing goes down I hope my friend Phil knows I only liked him in small doses because he could be a lot she's never at a one night stand I have and uh she was always like scared I was going to cheat on her of a one night stand I was scared she was going to fall in love with someone which I think is way worse she would send me text like did anyone hit on you after the show and I'd be like No And I'd send her text like hey do you feel safe with anyone from work because that would not be okay with me East Coast people drink West Coast people smoke you know what I mean and every time I say I'm GNA have a drink they always say you should you should smoke weed instead right instead like it's a similar experience I drink to quiet the voices of my my head I smoke weed it's like I had a party in here and only the worst people showed up every voice is like you're weird looking you're going to die alone that's why I like alcohol it's one voice and it's very positive you know you have a few drinks someone shows up in your head like cool jacket you don't have ABS but you're right there dude you're love it I smell some weed I'm not going to lie I'm looking right at you guys just by just by profiling like it's definitely coming from the band and the artist you want some do I want some of course but I'm trying to put a show on for you guys and it's going to turn into a very weird show if every other joke I'm like why didn't you guys like that one what was wrong with it I was so drunk like probably 8 months ago I was leaving my friend's house I hail a cab it was 600 in the morning I'm stuck stumbling I hail cap I get in the car the driver goes  LaGuardia it's in the airport and I'm wasted so I just said yes he just drive me to the airport as the sun is coming up I've got no luggage and then I finally sobered up a little I was like whoa whoa whoa JFK it's a better hug they got a they got a Shake Shack let's go there Wednesday are you putting it out I'm trying to see if I got a Wednesday show I don't  know is the problem we got two Thursday hey samarel here uh you've got a roof for this Wednesday night we will come cool friends a mic an amp nice view would help and some

of people to blast I can't do that first want to text me hey rare Manhattan text private show Private show roof starting in 20 yeah is that real mhm he uh my biological father he lives in artist housing which is weird cuz he's not even an artist in any way he's escape artist I met my biological father very late in life I had a great mom and dad who raised me my mom is my biological mom but then I met my biological dad late in like the term is legally adopted when he adopts you even if you're not in a  orphanage they say legally adopted which is such a dumb term legally what's you could just say adopted what's illegally adopted kidnapping right  that's anyway first time I met him though I I go to his apartment and he's just he's petting a little cat on his left and I was like huh all right he's like yeah I rescued her from the side of the road and I I nursed her back to health I was like huh so you did have it in  you I run into him at the rec center it's like the most New York thing to run into him at the Y I run because he goes there for physical therapy I go there to to swim laps you know which you know I know it doesn't look like it but I do put work into this physique unfortunately I see him at the rec center and I it was awkward I just said hey and he goes hey and I just panicked and I said I'll be right back and I just left and I feel like on some level he had to be like well played all done New Yorkers have more fun energy even the crazy people at least you're entertained you know I was on the train the other night late this guy walks on there's only a few people on the train just goes y'all mother  scared now just keeps looking keeps going y'  scared and like the third time he said it we're like yes we are scared this is the right response you are chemically imbalanced and there's only two of us yeah I figured out you know when the worst time to see a homeless person is is is right after you ate a bunch of sushi that's the worse right cuz they're like I'm starving I'm like I know me too this sucks and I just just spent 60 bucks which is which is the bigger ripoff meth or Sashimi who knows I don't La people you you Eaves drop and and some of the conversations you're like G I heard a woman in the grocery store she goes my phone is like my baby and I was like that's not true right cuz phones get better every year babies have made little to no progress I can go more than two minutes without looking at a baby you know yeah you would never leave a phone on the stranger's doorstep that would be insane but yeah if you saw a phone your doorstep You' be like oh my God why someone left their phone yeah someone lost it yeah if you saw a baby on your doorstep You' be like this was on purpose right that's all I'm saying phones are better right La even the way they talk New York it's like there is like a there is like a togetherness even when you hate the people you feel like a connection right in La they're just own their car all the time in New York you're like you're we do use that excuse you like I can I can talk to anyone in New York he's like not really though you just get like 2: a.m. I could go to the bodega and just be like how much for this pint of Ben and& Jerry's and he's like $8.99 I'm like you  piece of  but we're connected you know New Yorker do we do have like a way of talking right where it's like the add is so it could come off as rude to a nonnative right you're just walking down the street like dude you need to break up with that girl great Diner right there you should go to that Diner always a little distracted dude you need to get that abortion Chinese lunch special right here speaking of take out I mean that crowd was great very cool I flubbed the line here too but uh I mean they were forgiving they were cool they were they were little I could tell tense for so I like couldn't really feel like I go into the crowd really you know Crowds Are a little different right a little more tense they're not like you can't really do crowd work but uh I think that's cool I mean like I'm down to just do material too so we'll f it out maybe the West Village will be a little more we can improvise a little more there but uh you know I'm down to just get the jokes too and then the rest is gravy right so so I'm in the bodega and this guy he's like a crackhead is giving the owner a ton of crap and I was like hey is everything cool and the bodega owner is like oh yeah he's one of the good ones like one of the good he's one of the good crackheads it's that's how you know New York is back when the when the bodega owners and the and the crackheads are back like this they're sympatico F no it wasn't in case you're a comedian oh I am I'm professional oh well you should probably quit cuz that was really not funny why was that not funny what you were saying was offensive it how is it offensive I'm I'm really interested in how it's offensive I was talking about the togetherness and resilience of New York I'm not trying to start  here love your stuff oh thank you very tell them they're the wor that's the comedian that they were talking about oh really I just overheard them a comedian or something she thinks I'm funny no he's great I don't mean to interrupt him have a wonderful night with Oh no you're not interrupting at all you're great you're making you're making me feel better after that interaction hey fun you can  turn it around just like that that's New York someone hates you at one stop they like you 10 ft later I've never taken my shoes off to do comedy before this is the I'm going to steal a pair of Jordans on the way out I think I think you got to trade up that's my motto everything's a touchy issue now isn't it like they're doing a trans superhero in a Marvel movie that's a big story yeah they're doing a trans and you know they're just padding themselves on the back like we did it guys we did it you know they're going to mess it up they're so politically correct in those movies there's going to be a super villain like you mutants are all freaks except for you you're brave but the rest of you ah my cousin is trans yeah and uh my mom was concerned for her safety I was like look it's going to be okay being trans is a lot like being a stand-up comic cuz at first your aunt and uncle are like I guess you're doing this now but then in like three years you're like all right I'll I'll start telling people so just put your time in pay your dues my friend was talking about that trans Sports Illustrated model you know what I'm talking about he called me he's like dude she's so hot I can't even tell the difference and I was like yeah I know you mean well but that is a weird compliment to give a human like she's I Can't Believe It's Not Butter or some  like check out this impossible Burger of a v right here it was amazing I was watching mass shooting footage on CNN and they did um they show the footage and then they and then someone cursed and they bleeped is that not is that not our country in a nutshell right now what you're about to hear might make you very upset I I knew this year was  when uh when the Pope the pope said you got to give up trolling on the internet for Lent I was like I think we're doomed right cuz it used to be chocolate or cigarettes now he's like try to not call a stranger on Twitter a jiz rag for a few days can you handle that it's hard are we going to have PTSD from this I don't know a little right I feel like my PTSD is going to be like uh like you got a zoom meeting and I'm like I'm not going back to zoom I'm done with it you ever just look at your phone when you get a scam call and it says scam likely on it like man that's pretty impressive it's predicting the motives of the call I wish you would do that with every phone call yes your ex-girlfriend calls still angry you're like all right let's we'll put this off to a later  date I love those IRS scam calls I got one recently I said hello the guy goes you're in a lot of trouble I said what happened he goes oh that's that's how I should have known it wasn't the real IRS I don't think I don't think the real government is like a  dude you  up bad so I said what happened he goes if you don't send us Seven Grand immediately I'm sending over the sheriff sheriff yeah the sheriff I'm like I'm on the upper west side let me see let me see if there's parking for his horse real quick I don't know yeah man now they you know what the scam is they want you to go to Walgreens and buy gift cards and read the back of the code because if you wire the money they can get busted but you read the code they think they're all right you should know it's not the government at that point I don't think the real IRS is that chill they're like look if you don't have seven grand in cash we do accept Baskin Robins so we're we're pretty chill at the government we uh we like ice cream I I hooked up with a girl uh on the road years ago I'm in um I'm in Michigan I'm in the hotel room after the show with her she's chugging a giant water bottle before we were sleeping together I said hey is everything okay and she said oh I got to hydrate before and I said yeah cool I might have misrepresented myself here this is this is a pretty low impact activity you know think think elliptical not tread no that's me yeah and she said no I have to hydrate cuz I'm a squirter and I was like oh my God yeah you never see that Gatorade commercial right you you should Gatorade is it in you I don't know we'll see and she got nervous too she said does that change anything I said yeah the tip I leave housekeeping I got to bring it now so I'm telling my friend about it he said how was it I said you know while we were having sex she actually slipped a finger in my butt oh yeah and my friend said do that surprise you and I said what that she complied with my request that's the male gspot folks in the butt some guys say no I've been I've come back with good news it's right there just a hint like to hint of lime that much cuz some guys are like no that's gay it's not gay the butthole is for everybody the Buttle is like a Broadway show right gays talk about it the most but if you're a straight guy and you never go you're missing out yeah yeah I call mine Wicked that's you unless she goes in too deep then I call it lay M and yeah right now we're hoping that people show up how are you man oh hey sorry interruped looks like he's having a nice time I hope he doesn't hate  comedy you seem like a fun person are you like a yogi or something

about me jacking off his mom is like this is the worst this is the worst eulogy I've ever heard mad and I were just we were talking about people who like you ever you ever talk to someone they've got like nothing to say they'll just be like you ever see this movie and you're like yeah they're like good movie like that's it that's all you got it's like I I I I was working with a comic once and he goes uh to the crowd he goes he goes any birthdays and and some of the goes yeah it's my birthday and he goes happy birthday we're at a comedy club that's all you got how do you guys meet at a yoga at a yoga she was a teacher and you  went for it that's the dream it's a weird dream but look I you what did you say to her beauti smile you have a beautiful smile you're lucky you're handsome that line does not work for everybody you a beautiful smile holy  get away from me that line that line is reserved for people with your bone structure you know what is fun is some some of these celebrities getting canceled for  that we most of us I'm not going to say everyone here but at least the men have seen porn of someone will say this director auditioned women for his movies and then tried to sleep with them and I'm like that is Despicable I have masturbated to that exact scenario but uh it was scripted so feel like that lets me off the hook a little I don't know how long you guys been together year and a half year and a half was it a dating na no no work work yeah what do you where do you work we worked at an investment Bank you work at investment I thought you were going to be like I'm a director she auditioned for one of my fans and I was like lady you have got the goods that's great so you work in Investment Bank yeah and and you guys just met and after work a party or something Christmas party that's where it happens man Christmas party now let me explain to you why entertainers get cancelled all the time imagine a Christmas party every night it is funny watching comedians get cancelled for jokes that uh worked do you know what I mean they they'll roll footage of a comedian and the jok's killing and they're like this is Despicable I'm like how about all the people who are laughing that's why I record all my shows now cuz if I'm going down I'm taking all you  with me not so funny when the tables have turned no I watch too much porn uh I was watching a porn the other day uh yeah the day I have a good job and uh Tuesday and this woman comes on before the porn starts and she goes wouldn't you rather be with the real woman instead of at home alone jerking off and I was like yeah but I got a meeting in five I don't think I don't think I can swing it real women you got to you got to get them in the mood it's like it's like preheating an oven jacking off it's like a microwave it's not the same quality but there's always time you know hey buddy how are you are you catching this what do you think I love this what a time it's always good when you get a a neighbor heckling you and it's positive yeah buddy how you doing up there thank you sir wow he W he walked away I walked the guy in his own home I eat when I'm single the same way I jerk off in a relationship uh quickly and quietly over the sink and and I get sad I have a question for you guys you ever uh you ever think you're a sex addict and then you come and you're like definitely not turns out I'm addicted to coming every once in a while it's actually pretty common years ago there was this baseball player dumb and young he got really drunk in Time Square he spit on a guy pushed him called him a  Jew and the guy sued him for $10 million and it turned out he was not a Jew so that guy is the real anti-semite he's like what did you call me a Jew I will see you in a court of law after a very uncomfortable phone call with my lawyer because you know Jew uh because I'm a comedian people like to tell me their conspiracy theories and as a as a comedian I like him as a Jew it's not my favorite rarely am I like oh you think the Holocaust was a hoax go on I like I like where this is headed no I like the really off-the-wall conspiracy theorist I don't like the generic ones I like the ones that are like Jared from Subway I don't think he did it man he was framed by the big wigs at Quiznos no I was reading this article on Jeffrey Epstein the other day though I don't want to divide the roof here I think he was a pretty bad person um I don't know the sense a few of you look like you might have dabbled on this island but I'm scrolling through my phone and it just says it just uh have you ever have you ever read on your phone it doesn't matter the article there's ads it's weird to be reading about a human traff and then every once in a while you're like oh yeah Nike that's cool they should at least have to work the the ad into the article right like like you think what Epstein did was low check out the prices on the new LeBron this is crazy I think you date women that are like your mom right that's this a New York crowd you've probably been to therapy uh I think you date women who are like I do at least you know I'm because my mom was like a very overprotective mom I get sick she would react like I stage four cancer every time and I'm looking for a woman that can match that intensity it's almost like I'm auditioning her for the part of my mom I'm like I'm feeling sick and she's like it's just a head cold and I'm like thanks for coming in we're going to take this in another Direction so my mom would do the thing where she just reads me bad reviews I guess my mom will just call me and say I read that awful review you got I'm like what are you talking about and then I assume it's the New York Times or something and then I look it up and I'm like Mom Trip Advisor we we didn't have to look into this one we don't have to look at what every bad review says about me so I looked it up obviously it's from Naples FL Florida which is the worst week of Comedy I ever did and they give you one star reviews like I had a good time in their City one star yeah you guys were  one star I didn't like you and then I had to stay in Naples it was bad for everybody is the point let me read you the review on Friday night December 14th Sam Morel was inappropriate I like that she gave the date like it's Pearl Harbor you we had a family event planned for good laughs our son daughter-in-law adult autistic grandson and his friend adult autistic grandson I hope that's not how she refers to him in public we'll be three for dinner tonight me my husband and our adult autistic grandson he's like Grandma my name is stepen can you stop can you stop calling me that the first two local comedians were great and the food was excellent then came Sam Morel the headliner he was a terribly bad choice he spoke vulgar opinions that were not funny degraded his and our US president we can't even have the same US president that's how much she hates me I'm like Lady it's Florida we're all on the same sinking ship here okay he degraded Naples I did um I did and I'll do it again too  Naples um I'm not some snob I've been to Reno Nevada three times I'll go back I'll come back as long as you're not horribly abusive as an audience and he used autistic kids for a joke I did not I don't I don't even know how I would I just scann the crowd what is that some adult autistic grandson in the house why don't you get his ass up here so I can roast him autism style people began a protest no one protested I've been doing this a long time I've never had a set so bad that I've been like  they're breaking out their picket signs he also said he would punish The Crowd by going on longer that's that's that is all right look sometimes you hate the crowd so much you're like I'm burning this  to the ground you know I could go back and sulk in my hotel or I could ruin their lives he could not address this without insulting the age group of retirees telling them that they'd be dead soon let me elaborate I I didn't say haha you're going to be dead soon I said I feel bad that this shitty comedy show is one of the last things you'll ever see so she omitted The Compassion with much I spoke comedy doesn't let you feel good for more than a night I'll give you an example I did a gig in uh so this happened in 2014 I did Conan the first time I ever did a late and I said did Conan you're happy to get there it's a big deal for you at the time right you're like  it took me like eight years or something to get there the next night I do a gig in um Virginia Beach which whatever it's you know you show up I'm happy to be working I I say hey I'm Sam to the bartender and she goes someone needs to replace the urinal cakes in the bathroom I said cool I'm the headliner for the weekend she goes so no yeah that's airm no I don't he said well I can't do it I'm a woman I said well I don't know what to tell you I feel like it's a bad look for your Venue if the guy who's faces on the poster is lurking behind people at the urinal can you speed it up I'm on in five okay obviously I bomb every show that goes without saying I get off and it's not a Naples Florida comos bomb it's it's a Virginia Beach we drink Long Island Iced Teas we're not good people bomb you know so I get off stage I turn to my my left I see a giant poster of a magician so it gets my attention his name is Stu he's a handsome young magician spiky hair holding two doves very seriously and it's like wow what a weird poster I turned to my right it's stew in person it felt like magic he's at the bar and he goes rough set I was like yeah you could say that again he goes you should get hammered with me tonight and I thought you know what I can't s any lower why the  not so he said what became one of my favorite sentences ever he goes let me tell you something about this town I  Run Virginia Beach I think about that quote constantly I was like all right and he goes I'm going to take you I'm going to show you the Virginia Beach no one talks about and I was like that could be any part of Virginia Beach so I've never heard a thing about your city I don't think most people have and by the way then he just takes me to the bar next door which is a bit disappointing I thought we were going to see some seed underbelly I was like I could have found this and there's a long line let's just drink somewhere quiet and he goes oh we're not waiting online I  run this town it's like right I forgot so we start cutting the line people are getting pissed he Stu just giv him the finger I was like this guy might be a lot we get to the front of the line the bouncer sees him and immediately goes not tonight Stu people know this guy and Stu goes you better let us in or else and the guy just let us in that's all it took that was magic trick number number two we're in the bar st's buing everyone drinks we're doing shots we're getting wasted he starts doing magic at the bar he's a damn good magician it's incredible women are gathered around they're ooing and eyeing after every trick after one of the tricks he just grabs one of the women and starts making out with her and I was like holy  this guy might run Virginia Beach this is this is impressive then he just lets her go and he goes  this  strip club I was like it's not really my scene goes trust me and I was like damn it Stu we made it this far what the hell so we start walking to his car it's me Stu his friend who's a designated driver we get to his car it's a very nice BMW that's been horribly vandalized Stu falls to his knees and goes no who would do this to me and my first thought was anyone I've known you 47 minutes I could give you a list of suspects right now he's huffing and puffing he's like why and then he finally cheers up and he he just looks at me and he goes we're still going like all right we get in the car he's cheerful on the way there he even turns to me in the back seat and goes you've never seen anything like a Virginia Beach strip club and then we walked in I was like it looks a lot like Tampa honestly but we're greeted by this gorgeous stripper she kisses him on the mouth and I was like who is this guy and he said this is my girlfriend I was like oh stew you lovable sleev I've known you for like an hour and a half I've watched you cheat and I've met your girlfriend I hope that when she busts him cheating he at least handles it like a magician she finds some cocktail napkin who is Denise he's like let me see that magic she's like damn it Stu that was kind of cool we get wrecked me Stu the stripper the designated driver all of us we're bombed I the cab at home horrible morning hung over as hell a week later I tell this story on a podcast not thinking about it all right a week after that my phone vibrates it just says stew and I panic because I don't remember saving his number I panic again cuz I don't remember saving the picture that pops up St holding two doves like this so I press ignore he texts me pick up  hey Stu you made me sound like a piece of  on that podcast and I said no I didn't I made you sound cool and he goes true that's all it took that's how forgiving he was I actually felt bad anyway years later I find myself on trip advisor because of my mom and I'm looking up bad reviews I got there's a few of them so I start looking up some of my comedian friends they get some bad reviews too I don't know why but I thought to look up stu oh and he's got some bad reviews believe it or not one just said one star St bombed our corporate event will not have back and I was like hell no Stu deserves better so I left my own review I just wrote five stars this  runs Virginia Beach thank you so much guys thank you for coming out thank you so much did we get it light it whoa oh   hell yeah this   rules yeah we're cutting in between we'll see beginning special and everyone think that it's like oh down guy right you just made the special it's just me I'm the guy I don't like him summarizing our our art like this we're frauds

Sam Morril,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhslIoxYBfY,racism it must be uh learned behavior right cause you never meet like a racist baby though i would love to just an itsy bitsy teeny weeny racist what were his first words we'd rather not say and for the record they were taken out of context okay my uncle just got his divorce finalized my mom called she's like you need to send him a card i don't think hallmark makes that card what would that car look like just a dude sitting in a studio apartment smiling you open it up it says we didn't like her either she sucked they make the easy cards hallmark happy birthday happy happy anniversary the easy to articulate cards it's never a difficult card there's here's a card i'd like to see just a picture of darth vader shrugging you open it up it says turns out i'm not your father i ran into my biological father recently i told my friend he was like is your biological father a good person and i was like if he were i probably would not refer to him as my biological father most people say dad i look exactly like him i show my friend a picture he was like oh my god it's like you guys were separated at birth we were i liked the cool dab when i was a kid my friend's dad would smoke weed with us and i was like this guy is cool you know now that i'm older it turns out he is not cool turns out he's a grown man that did drugs with children so quite the opposite first time i met my biological father he took me out to lunch and the place he took me turned out to be a family style restaurant which kind of ironic they should make broken family-style restaurants you just walk in like where's the waiter i think he abandoned us i don't know but they forget to come out and sing happy birthday they're like we forgot but we'll make it up to you next year another guy comes out he's like i don't actually work here i'm just banging the owner huh i'll be your step waiter is that one too real for the crowd sorry it's on the subway i'm a new yorker and i i saw a couple fighting and as they're yelling at each other for like 10 minutes a rat ran up to the woman's foot and bounced off and ran away and she screamed but her boyfriend just laughed in her face and she was like that is not funny and he was like it's kind of funny and she was like no so i just went up to them i was like excuse me miss i saw the whole thing and it was funny i do this every night i got a great gauge and what's funny and not funny i used to fight with my ex all the time she was mad i didn't cry during the breakup she's like you're not crying during this breakup but you cried during that magic johnson documentary maybe that should show you how out of touch with reality she is that she thinks she's in the same inspiration category as the greatest point guard that ever played the game that guy played in the all-star game with hiv she wanted me when she had a headache all right i mean magic johnson i know we're in boston that guy's a legend every every endorsement converse 7up he never got trojan but i think he deserved to get it who would have been better if you were on the fence about wearing protection and he saw magic johnson's face in the box he'd be like we should definitely wear a condom there's a commercial you're coming out of a blackout you wake up next to a very regrettable one-night stand you see a little picture of magic's face in the box you're like oh magic thanks for the assist that's you know because it's a fun aids joke that's why you know it's upbeat i never wore a condom with my ex-girlfriend because she was on the pill ambien and uh i didn't feel the need you know some guy asked me on facebook this austrian guy is like you want to join my hate group i was like who do you hate he's like blacks jews everyone and i am jewish he's not even doing background checks what kind of lazy recruitment process i didn't even tell them i was jewish i'm like i'm just going to join the hate group and then drop subtle hints like while we're committing hate crimes just walking around hating i'm holding the torch i'm like dude you know what this flame reminds me of hanukkah the miracle of lights it's like yeah i guess you do hate jews i'm like dude i hate them i hate them so much i'm burning up i'm schvitzing that's how much i hate these people he's like all right we march on saturday i'm like i can't do saturday  what helps racism good food you can't be racist when you're eating good food that's why i'm annoyed by that terrorist group all shabab they sound delicious you can't be pure evil and yummy saudi at the same time that's like if there was an italian extremist group named the marinara boys i'll shabbat something something i would order when i'm wasted let me get some of that all shabab with the side of hamas that's why gays need their own cuisine right it'd be harder to be homophobic if you're like dude you want to order him some gay you'd be like i don't know that stuff tears my ass apart yeah i mean the white sauce is good but you know i didn't want to i had to you know i was talking to a guy who told me gay sex isn't natural because it's not sex for the purpose of reproduction i was like no sex i've ever had was for the purpose of reproduction that sounds like sex that's gone horribly wrong he was like it's against nature i was like i have  couch cushions before in my life so i'm in no position to judge anyone in what they do with their penis he's like yeah but god did not intend a man and another man like i'm pretty sure the guy who manufactured my couch should not anticipate me having sex with it some things are out of the maker's hands that annoys me when people bring god into the gay argument right if there's a god i kind of hope he's gay just for those people you know what if they had to meet him they get up to heaven god is just like i'm gonna  all of you so like i thought this was heaven he's like it's heaven for me once a year i'll i'll get into it with a troll it's like my mardi gras i'll really like i'll let it fly you know i like i'll look but i'm also like i mean i'm not gonna get involved or engage but once in a while it is fun last year uh and don't pretend that act like you're a great person here we're all mortified by this but remember the baby that got eaten by the alligator at disney it's a tragic thing uh and i was like that's terrible and then two weeks went by and i was like all right it's time it's time of course it's terrible but let me  try and uh i went on stage that night at the comedy cellar and i said i don't mean to come off like a gun nut i just think if that baby was carrying a weapon he'd still be with us that's how i feel not a great joke but it's timely and there's a woman on the front row and she just goes no  i was like well she's like you can't joke about that which guarantees i will continue to keep joking about it if you know anything about comedians that's all we need and she's like no you can't i was like so i'm like did you even watch the baby's funeral on tv which it wasn't on tv they don't they don't televise baby funerals but it is a pilot i'm thinking of pitching coming this fall to mtv after teen mom but uh you kind of ask allows us to even see the baby's funeral on tv and she said no i guess i haven't seen the baby's funeral on tv and i said well if you did you would have seen the mother come on through tears and say see you later alligator witches  she gets up and walks out her husband stays put which is how you know it's a good joke and there's a part of me that is excited by this because i know i'm the subject of conversation the car ride home you know that she's like he was terrible in the husbands like i thought he had some good stuff no so they emailed the comedy seller my home club and the comedy store affords me the email hahaha with 11 exclamation points i counted i did count and i will now read you the best email i ever got in my life here's how it opens okay you want blunt i'll be blunt so you know some bad  is coming it's never like you want blunt wonderful evening thank you a disgusting person sam morrell took the stage and spent the first few minutes of his act disrespecting the two-year-old child who was murdered by the alligator at disney i'm going to say it murdered is a strange word choice yeah  that makes the sound the alligator was paid to do it then afterwards you went to a pay phone and was like it's done  and then he belched and ran away in a trench coat i have never in my life been so offended and repulsed by someone i immediately left and stopped to tell your staff why this is my favorite part they followed me to make sure my drinks were being paid i mean it's just so wonderfully condescending that she's like i'm furious and they're like those coronas weren't free sarah i should say that the comic before me on this show friend of mine she made like six holocaust jokes and this woman wasn't bothered by any of them she even mentioned them in the email she's acting like they didn't even happen i mean some would call her denier but you know thank you thank you i would expect all human beings would be offended by a sicko making jokes about a two-year-old baby's tragic death saying his mother probably said later gator at his funeral i mean even in text form it kind of holds up you know it's this is a woman who's trying to get me fired over later gator a play on words which to me is a bit of a croc honestly it really is now i have posted about this on every social media account i own she sounds fun i've asked everyone i know to share it the comedian himself replied to me to say pretty strong act huh i did do that that is true if you troll me i will occasionally troll back i'm hosting a sports show and i basically got media trained because i think they saw me as a liability and they're worse but they were reading some tweets i don't know if you've ever had a gray-haired person read your twitter it is enlightening to say the least one of the tweets they actually read out loud was uh someone tweeted at you here sam that uh your comedy is a waste and you replied your father's jizz was a waste  i'm like so you want me to keep doing that or no she ends it by saying what a complete and utter pathetic excuse for a human he doesn't deserve to breathe the same air or live on the same planet as that precious little boy's family he can go fly a kite where's that last part it always gets me i would love to fly kite it sounds like a pleasant recreational activity kite flying she's very tightly wowed she could use a vacation i'm thinking disney but yeah the owner of the club is a very good guy like him a lot he emailed this woman said we feel bad you had a rough night here we'd like to make it up to you and maybe comp you and your husband for a night out and i hope they accept i think it'd be a great idea for them to rebook me for the gig nothing would make me happy they're saying they're like finally we can take our mind off that awful awful man your first comic coming to the stage sam the gator morel  you
Sam Morril,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4CLNsodjds,everybody please a big mom of love for mr sam morale let's go thank you for coming out  all right i've been told many jokes yet don't get too excited come on gotta be reasonable i was trying to bring a girl back from a bar the other night and she was like i'd invite you over but my place is kind of messy i was like yeah that's not really a deterrent at uh 3 30 in the morning like i'm gonna walk into her apartment and be like absolutely not i mean maybe if you fold these sheets we could talk but without a duvet cover i do not feel comfortable of course your place is a mess if you're willing to have sex with me i'm going to assume your whole  life is in shambles all right i was talking to go for two hours and uh i tried to kiss her she pulled away she was like i have a boyfriend and i said oh okay then she said even if i didn't have a boyfriend i wouldn't really be interested in you i was like yeah lady i got it don't have to reject me and then reject me again message received pretty sure that's not how they do it in auditions like yeah you weren't right for the part uh and even if you were you're  disgusting you should commit suicide right now i was trying to bring goldberg from the bar recently she asked if i was going to kill her it's not a good feeling really i'm not projecting what i'm trying to project on a first date it's like you're not gonna kill me oh you're like no cigar let's go back to your place that's your screening process for killers that's why i'm gonna slip up the honor code that's why i'm gonna lose him how bad a killer do you think i am oh i'm talking about how old a woman in the barn she kept saying i could be your mother i was like i'm pretty sure you're not my mom doesn't get hammered at dive bars on mondays also she's never made out with me i think we're safe then we got back to my apartment she was like you need to clean your room i was like holy  mom one time i was having sex with a girl while we're having sex she was like i want you to  me like you're never gonna see me again and i was like i was i had a breakup with a girl and i know that's pretty hard to believe because i seem so charming but my ex-girlfriend i dated she was a hoarder i dated a hoarder and she broke up with me that thing's extra hard i'm like the one thing she can get rid of it hurts she was always mad you know she we broke up she was mad i didn't cry she's like you're not crying during this breakup are you crying during that magic johnson documentary that should show you how out of touch with reality she is that she thinks she's in the same inspiration category as the greatest point guard that ever lived that guy played in the all-star game with hiv she would not  me when she had a headache so it just shows a lack of awareness on her part and honestly i worry i do magic's a legend every endorsement converse 7up he never got trojan but i think he deserved to get it no if you were on the fence about wearing protection and he saw magic johnson's face in the box he'd be like we should definitely wear a condom there's a commercial you're coming out of a blackout you wake up next to a very regrettable one-night stand you see a little picture of magic's face in the box you're like oh magic thanks for the assist it's uh yeah it's aids but it's fun age that's why it works guys a big basketball fan i was bummed they fired greg anthony the college basketball analyst he solicited a prostitute which you shouldn't do that but i don't think you should lose your job it's not like you're in a good place when you're paying for affection i don't think anyone's ever been on the back pages at 4am like everything is going according to plan oh your life's going bad i order food at 4am i'm like this is a terrible decision so i feel like ordering a human that's like next level regret i love food but the risk people take for sex you would never take for food right even if every restaurant was closed and you were starving you would never order a meal off craigslist even if a prostitute showed up with food i'd be like i'll  you i'm not touching that lasagna though i don't trust it i want to see a health inspector's greater than that lasagna food helps everything you can't be racist when you're eating good food that's why i hate that terrorist group all shabab they sound  delicious you can't be pure evil and yummy sounding that's unacceptable that's like there was an italian extremist group named the marinara boys oh shabob that sounds like something i'd order drunk okay let me get some of that all shabab with like a side of hamas i hate the terrorist guys i hate them i do it's a pretty ballsy statement to make in manhattan terrorists i hate the terrorists some of you were looking at my eyebrows like how much do you really hate the terrorists i do i hate them i have a terrorist like but i have like a very pale look so it's kind i look more like the ghost of a terrorist i look like one of the guys that came back to warn them don't do it you don't really get the virgins you see that last week they found the applications for al qaeda did you see that that's kind of weird you have to apply to get in there's some dude on the phone he's like dude did you get in he's got that guy  wait listed isis is my safety i don't want to go isis terrorists and comedians we have a lot in common we both get bummed out when not enough people make it out to a gig i got to imagine there'd be like three people on a bus i guess i'll do it but honestly i just thought a lot would be better than this food helps everything you can't be racist when you're eating good food jews we have bagels i go to pick a bagel all the time yeah great spot right it's a great name too not every place lets you pick i can't tell you how often i walk into a bagel where they just throw a bagel down they're like pumpernickel get the  out of here i'm like i wanted sesame they're like what do you think this is pick a bagel it says designate a bagel jew boy jew boy such anti-semitism black people have soul food arabs have the halal which is magical you can't be racist when you're eating chicken over rice you can be racist when you're digesting it but not when you're eating it it's too good i'm eating that i'm like maybe 9 11 was an inside job it's so good that's why gays need their own cuisine be harder to be homophobic if you're like dude do you want to order in some gay you'd be like i don't know that stuff tears my ass apart the white sauce is good though i'll give you that but otherwise i know guys i was talking to a guy who told me gay sex isn't natural because it's not sex for the purpose of reproduction and i was like no sex i've ever had was for the purpose of reproduction that sounds like sex that's gone horribly horribly wrong he was like it's against nature i said i have  couch cushion so i'm in no position to judge anyone what they do with their penis he's like yeah but god did not intend a man and another man i was like i'm pretty sure the guy who manufactured my cow should not anticipate me having sex with us there's a god i hope it's a gay dude i do just for how awkward it would be for those really homophobic people if they had to meet him what if they got up to heaven and god is just like i'm gonna  all of you but like i thought this was heaven he's like yeah for me for you guys it sucks we all have a little gay in us we i don't know if you know there's every straight guy and we p yearn on the urinal we look at the other ones dick i hope that's true okay uh i could be wrong but if i'm wrong i don't want to be right i saw a bulldog on the street with a leather vest my roommate was like look at that gay  dog like it's the dog's choice to dress like that you think his owner was like it's time for your walk and the dog's like hold on let me get my assless chaps so homophobic he is i was in this video online i was like hey do you see that video i was in he's like i think i saw that video on faggots.com why were you on faggots.com we ever keep an inside joke going it's not even funny but your friend is laughing so you're like i'm going to keep doing this my friend dan helped me move and uh i text him afterwards i owe you a beer but i accidentally put a j at the end so i just text him i owe you a beach it's not that funny i enjoyed it and he wrote back you owe me two and we had a good laugh and it was nice it's not that funny but we're not hurting anybody and we enjoyed it that's how we say hello now it's not hey do you want to hang out and play basketball hey do you want to suck my penis my ex-girlfriend did not see the humor in this joke at all i texted my axe and i was like do you want to suck my penis she was like excuse me i was like i meant to send that to someone else my friend dan who now they're on the subject treats me better than you ever did okay so on the elevator the other day this dad got on the elevator with three crying kids they're all crying and he just turned to me and he goes ugh wear a condom okay that's good advice for me you should probably get your kids to stop crying he's not gonna be very useful at the parent-teacher conference like your son's been misbehaving he's like yeah we meant to pull out so that's kind of out of our hands now i never wore a condom with my ex because she was on the pill ambien and uh i know that's a sleeping pill for the back i don't want anyone to miss out it's a great joke i ran into my biological father in the street and i told my friend and he was like is your biological father a good person and i said if he were i probably would not refer to him as my biological father most people just say dad i think i look exactly like him i show my friend a picture he was like wow it's like you guys were separated at birth we were i liked the cool dag growing up like my friend's dad would smoke weed with us and i was like this guy is cool you know now that i'm older it turns out he is not cool turns out he's a grown man that did drugs with children so kind of the opposite first time i met my biological father he took me out to lunch and the place he took me turned out to be a family style restaurant which i think is kind of ironic they should make broken family style restaurants you just walk in like where's the waiter i think this dude abandoned us or something i don't know they forget to come out and sing happy birthday they're like dude we totally spaced uh we'll make it up to you next year all right another guy comes out he's like i don't work here i'm just kind of  the owner but uh i'll be your step waiter this evening and uh i saw a dad in the coffee shop quizzing his son on dinosaurs every 30 seconds he would hold a picture of a dinosaur and his son would be like that's a stegosaurus and the dad would say good job stephen well done why are we quizzing kids on dinosaurs i've never needed that knowledge ever it's never come in handy it's never gotten me out of a jam never been driving drunk some cop pulls me over he's like what kind of dinosaur sister like a stegosaurus he's like step out of the vehicle we should be quizzing kids on things they're gonna need in life this should be the quiz he just holds up a photo of the same woman but slightly different pictures he's like all right stephen what's different the kids like her hair cut he's like very good it's gonna come in handy another photo of a woman he's like is she angry and the kid's like she's gonna say she's not but i think she really is  and the dad's like dude you're  good at this that's crazy you're better than me that's why i only get to see you on weekends but yeah  it's tough it's tough for kids you tell kids they can be whatever they want we don't give them the odds that would be helpful if i have a kid i'm going to be honest if he's like daddy can i play in the nba i'm going to be like look statistically it is possible but let's take a look at this chart okay taken the liberty of factoring in your size and race and it doesn't look good you're a tiny jew so not doing you any favors in the national basketball association we tell kids std stats we don't tell them career stats why not combine the two if a kid's like can i be president be like you got a way better shot at gonorrhea unfortunately i've informed you of two things i just read that it's considered child labor if a kid throws over 85 pitches in a little league game isn't that crazy yeah 85 it's a  game i bet the kids that stitched their uniforms overseas are like i would happily throw 86 dishes i haven't been outside in 72 weeks so that would be a nice little upgrade a lot of sexual terms named after baseball right first base second base if there's grass in the field play ball i came up with a new one i call it rain delay that's when she's crying doesn't look good for tonight maybe tomorrow get a double header that's how i look at it right  women are amazing though you are you are you can carry a baby inside you for nine months and then it just comes out yeah you rarely ever see a female magician think about that for a second that's kind of weird i think after all that time when the baby does come out a woman should get to say ta-da you've earned it never seen a female magician you know i've never seen a female mass shooter it's always a dude women they'll like murder their boyfriend or their husband but they will not kill a stranger i think men and women kill the way they love men are like i will kill anything women are like i gotta get to know you first jody aries was crazy she's getting she's not getting the death penalty but she was nuts stabbed her boyfriend 30 times slit her throat and then shot him in the head because you can never be too sure you know you got to take precautionary measures because he tried to break up with her and women always like want to be a man and break up with me to my face that's why i'd like to still have a face after this i'm going to stick to texting the boston bomber kids going down though you see he's getting the death penalty yeah i had family in boston yeah i was furious when that happened you know i was devastated you know my first thought was me and my brother we don't do anything together anymore see that's one that even if you don't like the content the structure is  perfect you know what i mean i know it's a sensitive topic guys that's kind of what i do here uh so my uncle just got his divorce finalized and my mom called me she was like you need to send him a card it's like yeah i don't think hallmark makes that card what would that card look like just a dude sitting in a studio apartment smiling you open it up it says we didn't like her either she was unpleasant they make the easy cards home mark it's never a confrontational card it's always an easy to articulate happy birthday happy anniversary i'd like to see a difficult hallmark card how about this one a picture of darth vader shrugging you open it says turns out i'm not your  father i saw a messed up dad headline the papers that stoned dad leaves baby in the oven i know that headline should have said stone dad puts baby in the oven that's more shocking i mean the fact that he's forgetful that's all you know wow if you guys like dead baby jokes i got another great one for you right here uh my friend's girlfriend just had a miscarriage in the shower and i thought wow worst baby shower ever yeah i'm not proud of that one either to be honest a lot of my jokes it's kind of like porn it's fun durian but afterwards you're like oh jesus i bad add my ex usually say sam you suffer from attention deficit disorder and i'd be like if you see me suffering why don't you tell shorter stories but it's true i have the worst atd it's insane yeah you ever have someone telling you a boring story you can feel your hands shaking and reaching toward your phone my god my phone would never bore me the way this  was born me i love my phone i'm used i'm like trained in youtube videos so i know much time is left that's a thing you know i wish i could do that with people i told you a shitty story you tapped their face like thank god only 30 more seconds okay i can survive but i'm giving it a thumbs down i like the phone i just can't deal with the phone like app things like the emojis i date a younger girl is always an emoji i don't even know what the  it means i want an actual interaction hey how are you monkey good talk thanks but boy do i love my phone i love it i dropped in the toilet recently i had to rush it to the apple store like it was the er or something and they were like there's nothing we can do i nearly broke down and cried in the apple store and everyone was like we understand i would almost rather lose a loved one than my phone not like my mom or dad but on uncle not even a question right i love my grandpa i didn't check him every 30 seconds i feel somebody pulling back on this one but i'm going to power through because i believe in myself for those of you that don't understand he was 89 the phone was brand new how cool would it be if when your grandpa died if they gave you an upgrade that'd be pretty neat right a better old dude they just hand them to you like he's just like your grandpa but he doesn't say the n word i'd be like that is an upgrade does he still say oriental they're like yeah we can fix everything the grandpa five not the grandpa 5s you ever tell someone a racist joke the midway through you realize they are that race and you have to backtrack before it gets ugly i do what do you call a mexican driving a pontiac a very successful man because one heck of a quality car he's driving i had a racial situation in the subway i'm a big knicks fan and uh yeah well you know it's kind of depressing that could be my suicide note just says knicks fan they'd be like we understand but i asked this guy on the train i'm like dude what are the next gonna do and he was like why are you asking me because i'm black i was like you weren't a knicks jersey that's why i asked you he was like yeah because it matches my sneakers and i was like oh that's because you're black  i see crazy people on the subway i can't even tell they're crazy until it's too late it's very frustrating this guy in the train just yelled out hold the door so i held the door open for him he gets on the train he just starts cursing everyone out one by one and they're all looking at me like it's my fault cause i let him on i think the lesson is just don't ever be a good person ever then a few days later this old lady was like please hold the door i was like i'm not falling for that  i've been burned before she was like my asthma i'm like nah i see crazies on the subway all the time sometimes i go someone see a crazy person on the subway so i go to the next subway car to get away from them then i see an even crazier person on the next subway car and i'm like i think i left a religious freak for a public masturbator i think i traded dab that was the masturbation equivalent of kobe bryant for vladi d box right there touching himself underneath his pants this guy looking at my girlfriend at the time not a good position to be in because she turned to me she was like you're just going to let him do that i was like you want me to interrupt this guy i don't think blue ball in this lunatic is my solution but she was like maybe you should fight him i'm like yeah i don't want to get hit with that hand i could beat the  out of me touching me once i lose a fight that's also a difficult situation as a man because i've never seen a female public masturbator i don't even know if they exist but i feel like if i did see a woman dead-eyed me and doing her lady business a part of me would be flattered on a  up level you know what i mean i'd be like clearly you need psychiatric evaluation but i did put myself together today and someone noticed so good on you i'd move to the next subway car but with a pep in my staff but she kept turning to me she was like you're just gonna let him do that finally she pushed me up i had to get in his face i'm like hey excuse me sir not sure why i'm calling him sir if you've been following the story for the last two minutes just came out you need to stop touching yourself like that to my girlfriend he's like i'm not touching myself with that to your girlfriend i was doing it to you hang on a second i was like you're just gonna let him do that  guys that's just a fun masturbation joke it really is some masturbation jokes are just for the fellas some are for the women that one's for the whole family i think i was going on a date the other night my friend called me he's like you're going on a date i was like yeah he said you got to masturbate before that day it was like what he's like yeah because that way if you get laid it lasts longer here's what they don't tell you though if you masturbate before a date you're going to want to cancel that day i call the girl i'm like there's been a change of plans you can go to the movie i'm going to take a nap it's harder to get a rouse now it is back in the day all i needed was a picture of jennifer love he would smile i was set now i'm  an actual woman she's choking me i'm like tell me i'm adopted she's like what i'm like i don't know that's what it takes now i'm not happy about it it's harder i hate to quit porn every point on ah you don't want to be that guy at a certain point every point online is that link underneath it's a share or post to facebook who the  even doing that got your pants around your ankles like you know needs to see this gary i fire off an email like dude i've been thinking about you funny not funny it's a thin line it is i'll give you an example i'm on the elevator the other day i farted i laughed that's funny right but then the door opened a hot girl came on not funny anymore then it was my stop i got off door shut she stuck with a fart funny again she goes to the next floor someone else gets on hilarious that's a good thing about comedy you can bomb a joke and just keep going it's not like real life if obama jokes socially so bad you're like i might need to switch careers very uncomfortable i was in a health class in seventh grade the teacher's talking about testicular exams this is my terrible attempt at a joke i just raised my hand i was like you know my doctor gave me a testicular exam he just kept his hand on there and played with it for a while no one laughed because it's not a  joke it's a declaration of something terrible it is not in any way funny she was like did that really happen and i could have been like no i could have backed down but instead i'm like i'm gonna commit to this i was like yes i'm like yeah he molested me it was crazy instead of accepting the joke wasn't funny i decided to incriminate a pediatrician but he did not go to jail in vain i got to record an album at the village underground  slept with a girl recently she dropped the n-word while we had sex that's kind of uncomfortable right i know the whole time we're doing it she was like no you know what it's a good joke because there's all that tension right we're like i think he's gonna say the n word then it's like thank god it's a rape joke all right the n word's weird why people created it but only black people get to use it right sort of like the magnum condom i did a show this guy came up to me like you were all right my girlfriend did not care for your ad cause you told a rape joke and she played a very effective interacting class at nyu so you know no i don't know so let me go up to a homeless guy i'm like dude i know what it's like i've gone camping we're the same person i saw a homeless guy sleeping and then sleeping next to him was a homeless woman i thought that's  sad you know this guy has a girlfriend and i don't that's just very upsetting to me hope he doesn't hit her because that's not domestic violence if you don't have a home that's a street fight that's terrible i love watching couples fight in public i do there's nothing i pull up a chair and i pick a side it's beautiful i saw a couple yelling at each other on the subway platform as they're yelling a rat runs up to the woman's foot bounces off and runs away and she screams with her boyfriend just laughs in her face she was like that is not funny and he was like it's kind of funny and she was like no so i just went up to them i was like excuse me miss i saw the whole thing and it was funny i do this every night i have a really good gauge and what's funny and what's not funny so i don't know much about relationships this is the one thing i know don't go to costco too early on with your significant other that's like a three-month contract renewal i was not aware of i was like look i want to break up with youtube we gotta chug animal crackers we have to finish so i feel the mutual disdain but i'm frugal that's all i'm you saying i don't know i don't know much i don't know much i did get in trouble with that n word joke uh with a blocker uh she wrote a nasty piece and i got a bunch of threatening messages but some were kind of enjoyable i got one from a minister and the subject heading just said you disgust me so i was like okay i'm definitely going to read this one you disgust me she wrote it five times in the email at the bottom she writes i'm disgusted my daughter has to grow up in this world so i just wrote back one line and wrote back how old is your daughter and can i see a picture of her she wrote back absolutely not i wrote back well then you discuss me i knew tonight was going to be a good night i was listening to that black eyed pea song tonight's going to be a good night that song has never let me down i heard this song once at 3 30 in the morning i'm at a walgreens drug store i'm buying stool softener i'm like i don't think it's going to be a great night to be honest maybe a little boom boom pow would be more appropriate guys what are you drinking though what is that yes you i know what he's drinking it says bud light on the bottle you have the interesting mysterious cocktail what is it a mango martini that's a weird thing to call into work the next day with mango martini looking before beer roll in the clear beer before liquor do you know it never she knew what a girl knows that you don't have a drinking problem if you're still doing nursery rhymes probably right i don't think there's anyone out there like wait quaaludes before crack never get my kids back heroin before meth one tooth left is the other part of that that i left out but just you know brush up know your drug environment i like when drunks call it liquid courage have you ever heard that has anyone ever done anything brave when they're shit-faced ever i think the braver thing i've done drunk is pee in public or tell women to get awesome boobs it's never real bravery never hear this hell there's a child stuck in this well is anyone intoxicated yes ma'am i am can you do anything no i can't great tits so awesome i was so drunk i was pissing on the street this cop walked up to me he's like you were not seriously pissing on the street i was like no i'm doing it ironically he handcuffed me while my dick was at that makes it look like i'm in a way worse crime than public relations do you guys have any feeling the allergies it's terrible i want to get claritin day at the store and uh and they make you go behind the counter so you have to fill out a little form and say you're not going to make meth which i feel like if you're into selling meth a waiver is not really a deterrent is there some meth kingpin going down like not only did he distribute methamphetamine he lied to monique at walgreens he's a monster which by the way that's a perk you don't really hear about math right i never really hear that they probably don't get allergies that's kind of neat right you're walking around bitching about the pollen count some dude crawls out of a dumpster he's like i didn't even notice i'm too busy trying to find my kids i don't know about it how about are there any newly engaged people here no just a  bunch of definites and almost you guys you're newly engaged for real how do you propose to her you what you gotta speak living louder you painted it don't  give him that he's  up the curve i just gotta spin when i spend the wife on someone i gotta be  picasso now over here you howdy propose to you on the beach that's a good move because if you say no he gets to push you with the tie that's kind of cool and then he lies to his friends like she said yes right before she fell in it's awful some people they i like i think breaking up creatively is cooler than proposing creatively anyway but that's what i want to do is hand a girl broke an iphone she's like sam this isn't working i'm like exactly that's that's good right cause breakups suck i feel like that we'd have some fun with that i feel like even if she cried when she was done she'd be like that was very clever that was one time i was in bed with my ex she was like what's your fantasy i'm gonna give you your fantasy i was like i want you to dress like a nurse and then i want you to tell me that i have health insurance it's like then if you get away with my copay that'd be  hot oh my god i hate a guy too some women don't like that i was uh i was i was at the bar was drinking whiskey this girl asked me for a sip of whiskey she was like ugh that'll put hair in your chest and uh just in case i'm gonna have sex with i don't want to be any weird surprises later so i was like also my back right here so my back my ex-girlfriend hated back here i didn't give a  that she had it but she hated it no she was mad i was hairy she'd be like you i have a gay friend named alex and she'd get mad she's like you know alex's boyfriend makes him shave his chest okay okay gay fights and straight fights are different i guess i would love to use him in my arguments love to be like connie alex's boyfriend lets him put it in the bud so i don't know maybe you should be more open-minded that's all i'm saying she's like yeah he also takes it in the butt i'm like forget i brought this up because it's been a while i've been single a while and i was on the road a lot i never cheated you shouldn't cheat but you know two years never cheated you guys won't know my secret this is my secret two years never cheated on the road not one woman tried to  me  that's how i did it sure it was hard i'd be alone a plane hot woman walking towards me i'd be like this chick better not sit next to me like that's the only thing stopping her from  me she's sitting next to me wouldn't even speak the entire flight i'd be like that was a close call i'm getting put to the test i have a southern frontier thing we call it cheating he calls it wandering which i kind of like it's like when a man wanders that sounds more like getting lost in a kmart than betraying a loved one moses wandered in the desert for like 40 years so his wife must have been pretty pissed off when he got back she was like exodus my ass where the  were you he's like i was trying to part the red sea i know it sounds like a euphemism but it's not it's a vagina joke but it's kind of biblical too so i feel like it evens out you know she was always mad i remember one time frank's girlfriend came home watching that movie annie hall great movie woody allen movie it's on tv and then uh she's complaining about her office drama and i'm kind of tuning around because the movie's on and she was like sam are you ignoring me for annie hall i was like i'm sorry was your story nominated for seven academy awards not even costume design it's one of the worst stories i've ever heard in my life spend all the day i spend like all days on facebook now what a shitty way to live some austrian guy added me on facebook he asked me to join his hate group i was like who do you hate he was like blacks jews everyone i am jewish he's not even doing background checks i know he's recruiting that bothered me more than his racism his lazy recruitment process i'm like you know what i'm joining the hate group but i'm gonna drop subtle hints like while we commit hate crimes just walk around hating i'm holding the torch i'm like dude you know what this flame reminds me of hanukkah the miracle flights yeah i guess you do hate jews i'm like dude i  hate him i hate him so much i'm burning up i'm schvitzing he's like all right we march on saturday i'm like i can't do saturdays shoppers facebook the local news another guilty pleasure of mine if you don't know the local news it's basically the news but just unfortunate stuff that you don't need to know with some smarmy anchor who's trying to be clever at the most inappropriate times there'll be some pedophile on the loose he's like looks like this ice cream man's favorite flavor was eight-year-old boy usually looking for sprinkles he's now looking at life in prison it's safe to say he's got a rocky road ahead all right that's the scoop jim back to you that's where you see those terrible ads you know like the life alert have you seen that where the old lady just falls down a flight of stairs and she's like help help life alert all companies should do that just worst case scenario ads just a guy waking up next to a chick with an adam's apple lens crafters get like a five o'clock shadow i should get my eyes checked for that i know how about that caitlyn jenner thing yesterday that was crazy right good for her yeah why not it's brave you know what i learned from caitlyn jenner is that you gotta you gotta go all the way right you can't half-ass it because if i got my eyebrows done my friends would be like you're a   but if i became a woman they'd be like you're very brave if i were women's underwear they'd be like dude what's the deal with that if i got my dick surgically removed they'd be like you're an american hero i will not soon forget it i say get rid of the penis too why not i don't know if she still has it but dump it you got the money you're not using it get rid of it you'll be a better person without your penis i have a penis it doesn't let me to any good decisions ever in my life i've never once had a boner and been like i should volunteer more it's all bad decisions and it's so detached the penis right you can so bad i remember had a breakup once i was crying i was so upset and as i hugged the girl goodbye i got a boner that's how disconnected the penis is from the rest of your body it's like the worst moment of my life my dick is still like see we can do  one for the road come on i'm trying to be a good person constantly in spite of my penis the other night my friend's like let's go to a strip club i said no i'm not going those girls are victims of sexual abuse plus it's too much money that's my stance like i'm not going to take advantage of some girls  up childhood okay not at those prices there's better options trying to be a good person but it's difficult i tried to join the big brothers program but they did not accept me three hour long interviews the problem is i get eight i have bad add and then at a certain point you just stop thinking and karen for the tenth time they're like what's a bad example of a big brother i was like you mean like a child molester or something they were like yeah we were looking for like impatient or something like that i was like wow i was way off i thought we were playing high stakes i guess not they were like what are you gonna bring to the big brother program i said patience also i'm not going to  any kid so i feel like i got a lot i got a lot going for me to be honest i was talking to a girl she was like sam i need a man that will treat me like a princess so i hired the paparazzi to chase her and she died in a car crash let me tell you a messed up story this happened a few years ago i had a bad uh breakup and i was very uh i was very upset but i was i was going on dates i meant to go online very pretty girl we going for drinks and very proper i remember at the end of the day i grabbed her and i kissed her and as i let her go she said oh my i didn't expect that and i was hammered so i was like well you better  expect it she never returned any of my phone calls ever so and rightfully so what a  tool i am then three months out of the blue she texts me during the day on a friday where are you i said i'm in union square what's up she writes back i want to see you and i want to get freaky with you so i write oh yeah with a question mark i don't have a cool response for that i don't get that text every day she writes do you want to get your dick sucked or not so i excuse myself from lunch with my parents because i feel like this is too good to be true it's time sensitive i don't trust it in my head more likely some dude stole her phone and this is his plan to rob me right it's going through her contacts he's like who's the dumbest  of this guy right here hey you want to get blown i'm like yes i do he's like meet me in this warehouse in queens i'm like okay i'll be there awesome so i call her she's like look it's me i've had a bad week at work i want to see you and i want to  you is that so bad i said that's not bad that's good so i hang up i go back to the table with my parents i was like mom i got to get out of here this audition just came up i lied to my mother's face in pursuit of a  it's not a high point in my life and my mom said go get him sammy i was like ugh i hate myself jesus christ i am low and i'm off and i'm on my way and everything about it rings wrong it's a different apartment than when i dropped her off it's you know it's sketchy but i'm like you know what it's new york people sublet this is what i call  rationale it's not based in reality it's just hopeful you know what i mean we get there i go upstairs nice apartment she pours me a scotch i down it she pours me another scotch i sip on it we start making out she starts going down to me it's very pornographic then all of a sudden she stops and she says gee i hope my roommate doesn't catch us so again me too i also hope uma doesn't catch us let's go to your bedroom and she said now i want him to catch us and that's when i should have left unfortunately i was with my penis at the time and that guy is  persuasive you know i was like we should get out of here my dick is like let's feel this out for a second are you sure penis he's like i got this okay penis you've never let me astray so we go to her bedroom she picks up right where she left off about 35 to 45 seconds later the door swings open it's a dude he's been there the whole time i think i've been set up you know he's just he's jacked he's wearing like a tank top and he's got like a cast on his hand which i'm like i don't know if that's some sort of sex accident he had he's just staring at me and she's still going in a moment of panic i turn to him and i go can i help you i said can i help you it seems very relaxed i'm scared out of my mind he just said are we going to do this or what do what her i said no no i think there's been a misunderstanding he's like you're either in or out right now and he gets close to my face i don't know if you've ever been terrified with an erection it's a very confusing feeling he is close to my face you're either in or you're out i was like dude what is this ocean's  eleven i'm out i'm not doing this i'm terrified i look at her for some insurance she just kind of shrugs so i i'm so scared i'm like in trauma mode so i just start panicking i don't even pull my pants up i waddle out i grab my backpack and i run which is like the least cool end to an orgy story ever my guy friends are like yeah dude i  two chicks i'm like i ran for my life as i reach for my jam spore so i leave the building i'm walking around the park and i'm like having a crisis like jesus what am i doing with my life you know about 30 minutes later my mom calls to see how the audition went like well mom more people went out for the part than i'd anticipated i think they're gonna go with this other guy  so one more story you guys have been awesome though by the way thank you so much for coming out  uh one more story i was just on the road i was in uh i was in north carolina i was kind of drunk after the show a little tipsy i'm on the elevator and this uh i thought this couple's being nice to me they're just messing with me they were like uh how was your night i said it was good i did two shows she's like oh you're a comedian i said yeah she's like tell us a joke then i'd rather not this has never gone well off stage in my life ever she's like just tell us a joke i said i'd really rather not her husband leans in and goes tell her a  joke i think what are you gonna bully me into entertaining you in the elevator no i'm not gonna tell you a joke her husband gets my face and goes really and they just walk out like they one-up me you know i'm going through my head i'm like why don't you just tell them a joke you could have put something together you could have whipped something up you know a lot of jokes so they're right outside the elevator said hold on a second he turned around he's like what i said i'll tell you a joke is it going to tell us a joke i was like yeah here's a joke two hick  walk into an elevator right i just let the doors slowly shut in their face then the last second he pushed the button the door open again he's like and then what happened thank you so much guys thank you for coming out really appreciate it you
Sam Morril,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Vny60-7CvM, oh  thank you for uh coming out in horrible weather for this I appreciate it it's a good time to be alive great time to be a man right the bar is it's nice and low it's nice I was with a girl the other night she said I don't think we should have sex I was like oh that's cool and then she goes wow you're a great guy I was like that's all it takes I'm pretty sure the alter ative is a felony I don't know if I'm a great guy but I'll take it I had a I had a good mom growing up you know ever since I was a little kid my mom would say no means no and she was talking about cookies but I put it together you know I uh I met a girl after a show in Florida I'm not bragging but I I do pretty well in Tampa  and she said I'll drive you back to your hotel but there's no way that I'm coming upstairs I said whatever you want to do is fine with me so when the parking lot when making out she said all right I'll come upstairs but there is no way that you're getting laid and I was like am I being recorded right now this feels like a me too sting operation so very loudly into her chest I said that's totally cool this is samarel March 22nd 2018 time stamp no I like consent consent is consent is the  consent that's the best part of the consent sometimes I get the consent and then I just I go home and I jack off instead get a good eight hours of sleep and my friends asked did you get laid last night I said no but I got the consent so you know pretty cool no I take uh I take the me tooo movement very seriously you know I won't even watch office porn anymore that's how yeah you can laugh it's a nice gesture it is you know I I used to like office porn but now I see it and I'm like he should not have done that there should be a guy that comes on at the end like yeah he doesn't work here anymore that was that was crazy there was uh there was this gay porn star I was reading about this guy that's how I know this and he uh I I do a lot of reading and he got uh banned from all these porn sits cuz he has Nazi tattoos on his chest which you got to be kind of a scumbag for porn sits to be like this doesn't really align with our values we're kind of a family here at gang fuck. net and we're disappointed it was hard to me to come out tonight you know well it's not the weather it's uh my neighbors are breaking up and I didn't want to miss it you know it's uh it sounds very painful for them so I don't feel feel good about it but have you ever heard a relationship unravel from the comfort of your own couch it's kind of nice I'll be watching the game and I hear the fight start and I have to hit mute so I can listen I was watching tennis and I just overheard it go oh yeah and I was like click she just yells out you have a tiny dick and I was like cancel my plans this is more important and then he goes oh yeah yeah you're a   and I was like all right so far she's winning for sure you know not even close and then she goes oh yeah your dick is so small so she's recycling material but um still a devastating blow you know not easy to come back from and then he yells out oh yeah well your  stinks and I was like all right we got a match on our hand and it's going back and forth so much it almost starts to sink up with a tennis match where it's like tiny day stinky  tiny day stinky  so finally at to knock on the door I said hey it's Sam from across the hall uh long time listener first time knocker you guys you guys are killing it I wore a little referee shirt I said both you should drop your pants I'll settle this  right now you breakups man they're painful right they don't feel good I got a text from my ex not too long ago she just said just out of the blue she wrote just so you know I'm seeing this new guy and I wrote back oh wow okay and then she wrote what you didn't think I was ever going to date ever again and I said no I didn't remember signing up for the push notifications you know I I'd like to hear less from you and the Huff Poe if possible but neither of you will leave me be you know the problem is we sex ed when we're kids but we need relationship Ed that's where you need the help I don't need help with how to put a condom on I need help with what to do when she starts packing her  that's where I need the guidance she's like I don't love you anymore and I'm like cool coach Mitchell did not cover this part but I could show you where the  is she's like now's not a good time like keep me posted I wore a condom every time you have to it's not fun but you got to do it it's like doing volunteer work cuz during I'm like this kind of sucks but then afterwards I'm always thinking good for me yeah I do it for the kids that's why you know got to wear a condom it's not the best but you know Lambs can anyone do a lamb skin condom yeah you do it what do you think you like it it's so much better it is yeah no one else just me and her we're the only shepherds in the house tonight what happen right it is good right it feels better here's how you do it if you don't know you  lamb skin and then you eat a gyro and then um and then you go out in a wool sweater you got to use the entire animal that's how you do it but I feel bad in relationships cuz I'm very disappointing you know I really am I think I think women are like he's a comic he'll be fun I'm fun there's other stuff I'm like the Dominican Republic you know I'm great for like 5 days and then then you're like oh this has some problems I was not aware of I'm not Haiti but I'm in the vicinity of what that is weird time and I feel for you women look the me too stuff I get it it's it's a weird it's a very emotional issue it's also a very important issue it's a weird combo though you know sometimes we'll see posted as a man it doesn't fully resonate I saw a post the other day it said there's nothing more feared than an intelligent woman I was like that's not true it's not even in my top five and I frighten easily but I've never been on the subway at 2:00 in the morning and been like oh no this looks like a pack of alct torans right here I hope they're not soon a come loud eh so much has changed it's kind of crazy you think about like I think about some of these movies from the 80s these sex comedies like porkys Revenge of the Nerds I love those movies they always had that scummy best friend you know the guy I'm talking about he'd always ask questions like did you get laid last night and he said no it'd be like this guy blew it I miss that character cuz it's going to be extinct they're going to remake these movies they're going to have to write in a woke best friend some guy like did you smash last night nah we just talked and he's like well sometimes a conversation is equally fulfilling so that's that's kind of cool A lot's changed some of it's for the better obviously I remember like in college not that long ago they would say things like don't go to that frat house say rofy that's an that's a thing they would say out loud and be like oh my God should we do something they're like no just don't go there that's it I got ruied at a party in college by accident but you know it still counts it's uh obviously was an accident no one at the party was like I'm going to rofy that hairy boy over there let me let me  a past that werewolf night that is male privilege right there isn't I just told a room full of people I got roofied I did not see one concerned face in here everyone in here is like I assume things worked out for you and they did still weird though here's what happened I was at a party and this guy handed a girl a drink and she said I'm too drunk and I said I'll drink it and he gave me this hateful look and I thought why is this guy so mad at me and then I chugged it and I woke up the next morning and I was like oh that guy's a sexual predator and my friend said you ruined his night and I was like that's not how I want to think about it you don't you don't want to think of yourself as a  block to some monster I prefer to think of myself as an accidental hero I have uh negative one rapes so you know statistically you know I can't you guys I can't take all the credit you know it's kind of like if I was driving drunk and I just swerved and accidentally hit a Mugger and some woman is like my hero and I'm like if you say so but I I might have a substance abuse problem so it's hard not to drink man it's very hard I work in a place where there's a bar every night I've been trying to be good it's very difficult I read this article it said uh try to replace drinking with another activity like tennis with a friend I was like yeah that's a very help full example that's always the crossroads I find myself at at uh 4:57 a.m. I can't tell you how often I'm coming out of a black out like  I should have done doubles instead that's I brought my Wilson Racket and everything that's you're tell me to replace an addiction with cardio that's very helpful I'm going to I'm going to start walking in the halfway houses full of crackheads like have you guys done Zumba it's so much better than crack they're like thanks we didn't know that was helpful of course you want to get  up have you have you have you tried living I'm happy and I want to get  up have you watched the news it makes you want to drink another mass shooting after another mass shooting it's always the same thing too it's always some guy who's like I heard voices in my head we all do everyone hears voices in their head good people just don't listen to them if I listen to all the voices in my head I would be sometimes Gay Street Fighter so I know it's it sounds like a confusing video game it's not you know why is he Honda butt  me well that's his finisher every Mass shooter it was a very quiet man that should be part of the background check for guns right you want this gun you better be  chatty do my podcast we'll see if you're an extrovert I don't trust it it's a sad time to live in with all these there's school shootings now it's horrible CU now getting held back is a real threat yeah do you want to go to summer school please I've already done two tours of freshman year I don't want to some of these jokes the content you're not going to like but structurally they're going to be really solid so that's that helps it does help with it look the uh these shootings are so senseless and horrible that sometimes these anchors try to make sense of them on the news and they try to sound profound it just comes out wrong I was watching this guy after a shooting and he said now would be a good time to be around people I was like yeah that sounds a lot like where the tragedy happened so uh I'm going to stay at home alone and if I die it's going to be from autoerotic asphixiation okay on my terms that's a better way to that's how I want to go peacefully in my own hotel closet that's a weird fetish right autoerotic asphixiation you got to choke yourself to come I don't know how do you even find out you're into that are you just jerking off in a turtleneck and you're like I like where this is going a little more press I was just in California they have a 10-day wait for the guns that's that's a good rule a gun should never be an Impulse by you should never be returning a gun like we made up so you know what's weird they always bring up the founding fathers every gun debate they bring up the founding fathers right they always say the founding fathers had guns they did they also had wigs it was a it was a long time ago that's how long ago it was they thought a powdered wig was a good look so that's my stance on guns you could have a gun but I think you should have to wear the wig right cuz at least then at least then I can tell who's dangerous from afar if I'm trying to get in my apartment at 2: a.m. and I turn around and see a Ben Franklin Looking   I just hope that's not an intelligent woman honestly but you know yeah yeah if you're going to go in the hood it's going to look like the cast of Hamilton but they always bring up the founding fathers they never mentioned the fact these people had a life expectancy of the mid-30s so it probably wasn't a big deal when they got shot I would assume most funerals were like look he had three to 5 years left top so that's like getting shot now in your 80s which would almost be kind of cool how would you rather die connected to tubes for 3 months would you rather go out like a g I want to die my ' 80s in a gang related incident I want my obituary to say comedian samarel was shot dead today at the age of 87 his last words thug life as he emptied the  CLP there's so much to be scared of too isn't there incels there new words you have to learn incels the involuntary celibates they don't get laid so they become terrorists and they look a lot like me it's very upsetting but that's a certain type of person cuz I have married friends that don't get laid they haven't made the jump to uh to Isis but maybe they should Isis lacks that type of diversity they don't have enough divorce men just a bunch of dudes death to the infidels a one guy like also Karen I mean we got a we got to kill Karen too right you ever read The Botch terrorist missions those are my favorites the ones who couldn't cut it there were these guys around 9/11 they were getting two drunk at strip clubs in Florida I love the fact that you come to this country hating us and then you go to a few strip clubs and you're like they're not that bad it turned out to be a false report though because it said they were going to strip clubs and dive bars and even college parties I was like oh man that's such a bummer cuz that's where you want to meet a terrorist like a mixer they're like we used to be Al-Qaeda now we're Sigma Kai so the objective is still vergins but you know I think about it all the time I think about you know all these scary ways you could die traveling I I've read this story about a depressed pilot who knows DOA plane and killed all these people on board so you know that's that's got to be a bummer you know what the first thing I say when I get on flights now is I say what a lovely day it is to be alive and I just I hope that positive energy trickles its way into the cockpit and they're like yeah it is good cuz I'll be on flight sometime and the pilot comes on he's cheesy and people roll their eyes but that's what you want that guy's still trying what do you want a down in the dumps Captain hey this is your pilot it's going to be a bumpy ride but you know that's life it's hard so uh says it's going to be a 6-hour trip we're going to land way sooner than that so uh buckle up or don't it doesn't matter I'm going to I'm going to murder you thanks for flying spirit depression man the depression is real it really is i i i someone sent me a very helpful article on depression recently it said uh it said these are the foods you got to eat if you're depressed which thank God that's if you're at that point just end it honestly is that has that ever turned it around for anyone I was going to jump off a roof but then I ate some dried mangoes and I'm feeling good they find your corpse on the sidewalk I don't understand he ate so many cashews why would you I'm not built for air travel I'm 63 I'm lanky I'm kind of weak you know I got a middle seat on my way back from La recently I get up to use the bathroom I come back the guy in the aisle is sleeping which is very annoying cuz you knew I was coming back there's no skydiving option on board okay I had to return and now I have to make the decision do I wake him up and piss him off or do I mount I think I'm more flexible than I am so I elected to mount and I have just horrible lateral balance I did not stick The Landing my leg comes down on his leg I'm on top of the guy as I'm on top I see his little sleeping mask come up what do you do you know I kissed him on the mouth that's what I did but you know there was nothing sexual about it it was a Godfather 2 Fredo kiss I said I knew it was you mostly cuz you were sitting here before but no I'm not I'm not built for this travel type lifestyle it's not working for me I had to see a sports medicine doctor about my back and he gave me muscle relaxers I said hey can I drink on these and he said absolutely I was like are you sure and he said I do and I was like that wasn't the question I said are you sure it's not going to mess my liver up he said it'll  it up real bad I like all right he's not my doctor anymore but we do hang out he's cool this guy text me all the time he text me the other day yo what the  is up and I was like what medical school did you go to I'm going to guess the Cayman Islands you know he tells me to swim at the rec center cuz of my back I love it I love the rec center I don't know if you've ever been there as a Jew it's fantastic it's just old Jews and Japanese men if you had it bad during World War II this is your spot okay fantastic every time I go swimming there's a morbidly obese woman on a noodle she's just floating horizontally across the lap lanes and we just swim around Her Like She's Not There part of the rec center code and I can tell when there's a new guy cuz he looks confused and I say that's Kathy I go right you go left we developed the system then on the wall it says rule number one no swimming with diarrhea which I'm like all right I agree I kind of wish it weren't rule number one one I don't know who that rule is for the most motivated human who's ever lived some guy at home like G I'm still going but rule number two must wait two weeks after having diarrhea to swim in the pool and I was like all right right out of the gate mostly diarrhea related rules you know clearly there's an incident that we're dancing around here you know you didn't pick a First Rate exercise facility when all the rules are like could you not  on our stuff it's been a  problem I love this place everything about it off I went to the bathroom I knock on the door and the guy in the bathroom yells out who is it that's not what you're supposed to say you're supposed to say I'm in here you're not supposed to be expecting company in the men's recck room bathroom but I figured I'd give it a shot so I said it's Sam and he goes no there was the right  answer you're going to hate this next show but I'm going to do it anyway this is how bad my back was I read a headline in the paper that said Graveyard worker had sex with over a hundred dead bodies and my first thought was that does a lot of digging you know I know that's a horrible person but that's also an unattainable Fitness goal for me and I would I would kill for that core strength how much True Crime is there going to be are you guys watching this like me it's so addictive yeah give it up for all these murderers for all this great content you you keep killing we'll keep watching that's what I say I don't want to point fingers here but you women are getting murdered at an alarming rate I don't know if you're paying attention I would recommend never going home with us ever if a woman goes home with you she really trusts you or she's taking a chance you know so whenever I open the door I always turn to her and I say hey thanks for rolling the dice you know I appreciate it that's all I watch is is murder and stand up I've been doing this for a while I see comic sometimes on Netflix I'm like this guy  stinks I wonder if murderers watch True Crime like this is pretty disappointing hly three murders in 5 years I should be the one on television we all do it we're getting desensitized you ever just watch four straight episodes of Law and Order SVU and it hits you you're like that was probably too much rape for a Sunday I don't know I'm not even paying attention I'm folding laundry and I'm thinking when did this become background noise in my life I should not be consuming SVU like it's smooth jazz you know the darkest plots you've ever seen I'm watching One the mom's pushing her baby in the stroller she turns around for a second then turns back around the baby's gone that's not even bad parenting that's incredibly efficient kidnapping by the way you got to give credit what credits do cuz she was crying I'm a horrible mother and I was like no you ran into one of the greats that was that was like the Steph Curry of abduction that was pretty Flawless see it on these dating sites too I read this article it said that you got to be careful on dating apps now because there these gangs all post pictures of really hot women and then you show up on the date and they just Rob and beat the  out of you that's got to be a bummer cuz it already sucks when it doesn't look like the picture that's going to suck actually you show up for your date at 2: a.m. at the bridge and uh eight dudes are walking toward you and you're like Kathleen I was in Uber right after breakup you ever just overshare with the driver he said how are you I said I had this breakup he said let me tell you some  about breakups and the second he said that I thought I might have  up you said you know what I did when my girlfriend left and I said what he's like I  everyone you think that heal and I said no and he said it did all right he said you know what else I did I called her up I told her all about it you think that heal and I said God no and he said I did and I said I'm going to stop guessing cuz you're very unpredictable went on for 20 more minutes I finally got the car I was like do you think that was helpful for me at all and he said probably not and I said it was one of the hard things about dating now is uh a lot of younger people are meaner they're very mean that's how they flirt I think it's called negging I was talking to go after a show my poster was up and she goes why you look really ugly in that picture I said oh that's not very nice and she goes you're a ComEd Ian I said yeah I'm also a human being so I enjoy Pleasant conversations as well and I was wearing a striped sweater so she goes nice sweater did you wear it on purpose or did you escape a prison she said prison which kind of bugged me I was like I feel like you don't know a lot about prison I said I'd like to escape this conversation she said that's all you got and I said I have to be meaner to you to communicate she said Hit Me With Your Best Shot Mr comedian I said rather not she said come on so I said all right you're very pretty and I'm very lonely and I would still rather masturbate than pursue this um yeah so we're back at my place and you know yeah it works negging works I'll tell you it really does I was making out with her and it hit me I don't even like this person I'm thinking what am I doing I'm making out with her I said maybe maybe we should stop and she goes what you're rejecting me and I said I don't think there's a good idea and she said I'm really turned on now you're saying no to me and I said you seem like a pretty unhealthy person she said no one's ever rejected me this is the most turned on I've ever been I said well then you're going to be super hot for this Uber I just called you okay hopefully get the guy I got he loves to  I went on a date with a girl she told me your last boyfriend was 60 which I thought was kind of shocking I said that's a pretty big age Gap she let me tell you something there difference between a 30-year-old dick and a 60-year-old dick and I said I haven't done the research but I feel like there is I'm going to go with temperament I think that's the difference a young dick is like an intern up at the crack of dawn overeager down for whatever an old Dick is like a CEO he's like this better be important okay I don't have a lot of time so we're on the date we're making out in the bar she starts going underneath my pant she just looks me dead in the eye and goes why aren't you a wed I was like a wct what are you a Transformer who talks like that I'll tell you why cuz we're kissing I'm not 14 have you seen the  that's out there you want to get me hard tell me you're a dental assistant your husband's coming home in 5 minutes I'm we'll talk you know I watch too much porn so I do it's it's I'm aware of it you notice that while you're having sex sometimes cuz we were having sex and it was good and while we were doing it I just said I will eat your butt and she said you don't have to do that and I was like thank you I overextended myself thanks for uh catching that one in realness back in you know his porn is just not good it's all these dark topics I saw a taboo link on a porn site so I clicked on it and it was incest porn I was like all right you call my bluff that is taboo you know then the next one was inter it was interracial and I was like they should divide these up a little better I don't know what kind of racist porn site every porn category is just  you should never do right like  your best friend's mom it's rude blackmail your boss it's a place of business it's criminal you know we need some positive porn categories to rewire us we need categories like um couple that's been together for a while  after autism benefit he be like all right well I'm not glad I jerked off at 2 p.m. but they raised a lot of money for those those kids yeah instead of the money shots just a link that says donate now this side of the room is really  into that joke huh and this side of the room is Christian they were raised well I don't know man I just uh I'm happy I'm doing this in New York you know cuz I'm I've been on the road a lot no I'm not I'm not Pander so no I'm I'm useless on the on the road I can't drive I can drive but if you were in a car with me you'd be like pull over I'm going to drive this is it's not good I'm bad and Reckless that's a bad combo you ever get cut off by a reckless driver then you catch up with them you got to see what they look like it doesn't matter what race or gender every time I see what they look like I'm always like I  knew it could just be a white guy my Classic this is a classic white  takes what he wants contributes nothing to society I'm only going to do the example for white people but you know you know don't want you to get uneasy I heard a guy yell at a cab driver the other day he said learn the goddamn language was that messed up right and guess what it's sometimes nice when they don't know the language right you ever call a car to the airport at 5 a. and you get a little Korean guy like oh this might be a nice quiet ride then you get in the highway and he's like weather's weird you're like   this jack off learned the language I'm a Yellow Cab man I don't like lift or Uber I don't I'm not my thing you know why cuz you rate them they rate you you're both on your best behavior it feels like a first date even the way they pick you up feels like a blind date right they're like are you Sam and I'm like yes I like a yellow cap it feels like a marriage neither of you are trying at all the second you get in he's mid-con conversation on speaker phone I'm in the backseat eating cariban street food we're both hammered you know no one's putting on airs you ask him hey can you drop me right in front of my apartment he's like nah I respect that good for you holding your ground there I did nothing all day man I did nothing I watched the news I saw an anti-smoking ad it's weird that they can do anti-smoking ads but you can't do pro cigarette commercials isn't that weird they don't give them a rebuttal and I'm not like a big cigarette guy but I like one when I'm drunk sometimes it's nice I thought of a good Pro cigarette commercial how about this for like a casual smoker a hot girl walks up to a guy in the bar and ask to bum a cigarette and he goes oh I don't smoke so then she goes outside and bums one from another guy and they go home together and they  and that's the whole commercial then at the end it just says wouldn't kill you to carry a pack you know Mal just in case all right I got some momentum let's break out the abortion jokes so if there was ever a Time my friend just had one her boyfriend didn't contribute to the cost which I thought was not cool you know she's going through yeah that's not a very Noble stance I don't think that is how low the bar is I'm like guy should pay a little bit for the abortion of women are like he's a hero he really is no even the most pro- lifee person I talked to was like Wow chivalry is dead that was the baby's name chivalry and you know dead I'm just saying that one that one's not for everybody that you did that joke the other night and someone yelled out boo I thought it was a baby's ghost but you know I'm just I'm just saying there's still gentlemen if I knock you up and you need an abortion it's on the house I'll throw my Delta Sky Miles Card right on the counter are you sure Sam I got this with all the rewards and benefits the Delta has to offer I'd be a fool to do otherwise I'm two to three abortions away from Diamond Medallion status so I'm losing some of you I'm going to take it a step further here I think I think you should get extra Sky miles points with an abortion CU that's one less crime baby on board you know that's yeah I don't me personally I don't like doing that part of the joke but I have a sponsorship deal with Delta and you know it's they get very upset when I leave it out they dock me Biscoff cookies love those cookies I was talking to a guy after a show he told me there's going to be an anti-abortion parade which I think he meant to say March you know I don't think there's going to be a parade but if there is I'll be there I want to see what the floats look like that one looks unfinished that's what we're going for so yeah backto back abortion jokes I got greedy guys I did I got a little greedy I'm a pretty liberal guy but some of my friends now are so liberal that everything it turns into like slavery or the Holocaust in every conversation you know what I'm talking about I was talking to my friend the other day and he goes Trump is Hitler I said all right look we don't know how hilarious Hitler would have been on social media that's not fair Hitler might have had a strong Twitter presence trapped in Bunker sad adol's trending I came across this article the other day on the internet just said fun facts about Hitler which I think is a great title I've always said there aren't enough upbeat pieces on the fur fun fact about Hitler didn't pay income tax was very bad at managing his money and I thought man it's too bad there wasn't a group of people that could have helped you know that's je so that's you know that joke did not hit Naples Florida okay terrible people my least favorite City I'll never go back I bombed four straight nights I got to an argument with an 80s something year old man I had a breakdown on the last show I finally just said I got to get out of Naples he goes well you're still here I said I'll be out in the morning you'll be in the casket soon and he said you'll have to put me there and I said that's not how time works and it kept escalating back and forth finally I hear a voice in the crowd yell out Grandpa enough that's Naples to me my dad called me to check in he said how are you I said I'm in  Naples and my dad goes Italy and I was like oh no these jokes are not taking me abroad pops I'm in Florida the bad part true story I'm on stage there I just out I just as a start to a bit I go so I'm a New York Jew and some of the cowd goes GH no not a yes or no question it's my Heritage also GH that's our sound that's cultural appropriation  okay not all gigs are this fun man my I think my mom worries about my career choice sometimes sometimes it'll be a bad gig I do casinos sometimes are the worst gigs ever you know they pay pretty well but they're Soul crushing you're just watching people stand up one by one and exit throughout the show some by scooter it's very jarring but uh and the casino is not even mad because they want these people pissing away their money on the gambling floor you know so I go to apologize to management they're like no you're doing a great job you should bust out the abortion jokes earlier tomorrow night cuz those went horribly but I think she worries my mom worries a lot I was with her the other day on the street we saw a dead bird and I said ew dead pigeon my mom goes don't touch it I was like what do you think happens when you're not around you think I'm just walking around let me grab this  right here hell yeah lunch  me I don't blame my mom for work and you know I I still get in trouble I I got assaulted in Burlington Vermont earlier this year which is not where you think it's going to happen a lot of open toad sandals everyone's High I thought it was safe honestly but they seem like nice people Bernie even seems like a nice guy I like Bernie Sanders you know why cuz he debates the way I've argued with every woman in every relationship I know I don't have a chance I just want to get my ideas out there you  know so I'm in Vermont and I'm out after the show I'm having a couple beers with some Comics we a bar two blocks from the venue some guy walks up to me I can tell something's off about him and he just looks at me and he goes University of Vermont and I said no and he goes master's degree and I said you're getting colder and he said I want to beat the  out of all of you but he's only looking at me yeah and I looked him up and down I was like ah he's bluffing so I turn around as I turn around he grabs by the shoulder takes a pint glass and smashes it over my head and I thought I poorly read that situation he he was not bluffing so he runs out they call the cops and the first thing I say after he hangs up with the cops is I yelled to the bar you all heard him call me Jew boy before he did it and they said I didn't hear that and I said I did and a JY Smet tail is born so they put him in the back seat the cops get him very quickly he wasn't getting far on foot he's in the backseat of the car the cops are examining to see how bad my injury is they're taking glass out of my hair and theop top asked did he smash a pint glass on your head and I said it could have been a pint glass it could have been a manora it happened very quickly okay and the cop asked do you see spinning I said like a drele it's pretty rough you know then finally I had to admit it wasn't a hate crime and they took the guy away and the bar manager turned to me and he said just so you know this never happens here and I was like yeah I figured that'd be pretty weird if you were like that was Scott so Scott does that I've unfortunately had a bad string of luck on the road some of it's my fault about eight years ago I was drinking too much I was a young comic on the road I was in Seattle I was hitting on a girl after the show every 30 seconds her friend would lean in and go not interested every 30 seconds she could do a bit better than you it would get progressively mean at one point she goes you're very unattractive and I was a drunk kid I just said get some more Botox you lizard I'm deeply ashamed of myself for saying that and it's completely appropriate although if you were there you would have been like he nailed it totally but she seemed Furious I couldn't tell by her face but she seemed very upset me and my friend were laughing as we're laughing I get popped in the face by her boyfriend I deserved it she was a lizard but she was his lizard and I thought it was cool that they stuck together you know but this was foreshadowing a month later I'm in Cleveland horrible time to be in Cleveland it was when LeBron left the first time okay yeah exactly I don't know if you guys remember but they did not not take it well and they made the mistake of having their whole economic plan of the time be um LeBron and that's it so it was rough and I I love Cleveland I've always had good times there I like the people it felt like the whole city got dumped because it was Valentine's Day too it was just a weird vibe and I met this hot older woman after the show and we hit it off but she's there with a guy friend who's just a friend but it's Valentine's Day there's that weird energy in the air he's kind of going for I'm going for and he's buying me drinks to keep an eye on me and I'm accepting the drinks because I lack character so he gets up to go to the bathroom and I asked her do you want to get out of here and she said yeah let's ditch him this is how stupid I am I take her to the barn next door that's my getaway plan I was like 7 feet to the left we got this so we're doing shots we're making out it's a very romantic night and I'm glad some people laughed at that but I can tell him in a shitty City when that doesn't get laughs at all well people like that's a very romantic night out that's Dr humping and Jagger shots that's that's how we did our 40th anniversary so I finally said hey do you want to do you want to leave and she said I want to go back to your hotel and I said all right then so we go outside the dude is standing right there and I was like oh no he goes so there you guys are where the  do you think you're going I said ah we're going to go back to my hotel and he goes oh yeah you're just going to  her and then fly back to New York and I said honestly yes that was a game plan I I was going to pitch it quite differently I was going to say something romantic like shall We Make Love before my Expedition or something and I was I was going to liven it up a little he gets close to me goes you want to  her you got to fight me first and that's the first time I noticed he was missing teeth and I was like oh no he's been down this road before and I'm not going to fight him cuz I've never had sex with anyone and been like that was better than teeth never after every one night stand I'm like man it's cool I could still eat apples after this this is is great you know I run down to the hotel lobby I grab me a Macintosh I go about my day so I said hey I'm not going to fight you and he said that's what I thought  come here babe doesn't say a word to me just calls her over she goes with them they clearly have a weird arrangement of some sort they start walking away as they walk away there's a guy behind me in a white sweatshirt mat matching white sweatpants very underdressed for Cleveland in February okay he's not quite sitting he's not quite standing he's almost perched and as they walk away he loudly says I wasn't going to let anything happen to  you uh who are you he walks over and he goes I police this part of town I said you're a policeman he's not this man is obviously not with law enforcement of any kind so I asked you work for the bar he said no and I said are you a vigilante of some sort and he said yeah and he's in white so I said what's your superhero name the snowflake and he said I go by the White Knight and I'm just drunk enough to be like hell yeah that's all it took I'm like this guy's legit he's got a name so we started chatting I'm kind of baffled I asked him you just wait outside and break up fights and he said I protect downtown Cleveland I said haven't you been hurt he said I've been stabbed twice I was like dude why do you do this he CU I  love Cleveland that's why and it's kind of touching honestly he's crazy but he's loyal they lost LeBron they got this guy it's a horrible trade don't get me wrong but this is what loyalty looks like it's not always pretty you know so we start taking a walk I'm taking a little stroll with the white knight and we passed the comedy club and my Poster's in the door and he said you're a comedian I said yeah he said I can never do what you do and I said I could never do what you do either it's um it's illegal and strange and quite alarming to be frank so there's a real Mutual admiration going on you could say and we started chatting for a while about life and love you know at one point he asked me why don't you have a girlfriend on Valentine's Day and I said probably my life choices and my career and he said me too and I said we're not so different you and I white night so he walks me back to the hotel and he said he's coming to my show tomorrow night and uh I said great so I'll see you then we exchange information as you do with Vigilantes and I wake up the next morning head poundy thinking did that even happen but of course it did you don't you don't Daydream the white night first email I see just says subject heading white night night and I thought I think it's him I don't I don't know that many white Knights it said Sam it was such a pleasure to meet you last night unfortunately something came up and I'm unable to attend your show this evening sincerely your new friend and fan the white knight in parenthesis Joshua that made me very happy Jews are very underrepresented as superheroes you know he's he's our black panther so I email him back it bounces back I email him again it bounces back to the point I'm like this guy's created a fake email account to contact me and then just disappear it's very it's very it's like in Batman when he's talking to Commissioner Gordon and he and he turns away for a second turns back and Batman's gone but you see the wind moving he did that to me via email it was always in the back of my head years go by never hear from but I always thought about it cuz I've had weird drunk nights but this one's particularly strange so it must have been six years later I get an email out of the blue different email address but it still says subject heading white night and I thought it's probably him I don't I don't have a large white knight Rolodex so all it said was saw you on Conan funny  white night and I wrote back hell yeah dude you're still out there white nighting I'm still doing comedy we're both still in the game and he wrote back oh no I no longer engage in white nighting I now have a wife and a little boy and we reside in the suburbs of Cleveland and I was like this traitorous   and then he wrote how are you and I said I'm in  Naples and he wrote back Italy and I was like yeah thank you so much for coming out guys you've been amazing I appreciate it very much all right thank you so  much  a for

they're always there for you the cabbies and the B Oh what is with the B oh and these guys how long are these shifts can we get this man a 10-minute break for a shower you're in the back it's coming through the glass you just know that when they put that cherry pop it stuff on the dashboard so you get the cherry Bo I don't know what that's supposed to be even fruit showers more often than this they're finding to me about being in these characters that when you're in Manhattan for some reason you don't get scared no matter how fast the guy goes well you know he's driving fast and recklessly but he's a professional it's got a cab drivers license I can see it right there I don't even know what it takes to get a cab driver's license I think all you need is a face this seems to be their big qualification no blank heads are allowed driving cabs in this time also helps to have a name with like 8 consonants in a row ever see some of the letters in these names what is the O with the line through it by the way what planet is that from you need to charter the elements if you want to report the guy yes officer his name was Amal and then the symbol for boron no it was not manganese I had the periodic chart with me at the time but I love to travel I love it whether it's a car or it's a plane like to get out there like to keep it moving I love airports feel safe in airports thanks to the high-caliber individuals we have working at x-ray security how about this crack squad of savvy motivated personnel the way you want to set up your airport security as you want the short heavyset woman at the front with the skin tight uniform that's your first line of defense you want those pants so tight the flap in front of the zipper is pulled itself open you can see the metal tangs hanging on for dear life then you put the bag on the conveyor belt goes to the little luggage car wash then you have that other genius down the other end looking in the little x-ray TV screen this ice tine has chosen to stand in front of x-rays 14 hours a day as his profession looking in that thing I I have looked in that TV screen I cannot make out one object he's standing there what is that a hairdryer with a scope on it that looks okay keep it moving some sort of bowling ball candle yeah I got no problem with that just you know we don't want to hold up the line so I go to the bathroom in the airport what is the story on the sinks in Airport bathrooms that they will not give us a twisted on twisted off human style faucet is that too risky for the general population too dangerous we better install the one-handed spring-loaded pain-in-the-ass Alcatraz style faucets you know those ones we got to go away for I got a little water there what is it that they think we would do with a foster turn them all on full run out into the parking lot laughing pushing each other into the bushes  come on the water's on let's go I turned it on oh yeah we're businessmen we're gonna miss our plane who cares water that's how they think we'll be hey do the people that work in these little shops in the airport have any idea what the prices are every place else in the world yeah $14 tuna sandwich we think that's fair that's what we charge in our country then you get on the plane pilot of course always has to come on the PA system this guy's so excited about being a pilot he can't even stand himself well I'm going to take it up to about 20,000 and I'm gonna make a left by Pittsburgh and I'm gonna make it right by Chicago then I'm gonna bring it down to 15,000 the whole route all his moves we're in the back going yeah fine you know do whatever the hell you got to do I don't know end up where it says on the ticket really  do I bother him with what I'm doing knocking on the cockpit door I'm having the peanuts now yeah that's what we're doing back here thought I'd keep you posted I'm not gonna have them all now I'm just gonna have a few I don't want to finish it because it's such a big bang then the stewardesses have to come out they have to do their little emergency equipment show you know that thing they do one of them reads it the other one acts it out hey we have seatbelts and oxygen man's things for you to use they show you how to use a seatbelt in case you haven't been in a car since 1965 oh you lift up on the bucko I was trying to break the metal apart I thought that's how it works I was gonna try and tear the fabric part of the belt I thought if I could just get it started  then they always point out the emergency exits always with that very vague point though isn't it where that where the hell were these places beaver just said planes at a 90 degree degree angle your hair's on fire you're looking for those now you think you're gonna do there she's thinking I'm getting out before you're getting out you're dead you're dead I'm going then they always have to close that first-class curtain - and I always give it that little look maybe if you would work a little harder I wouldn't have to do this  it's all tiny world on the airplane isn't it as always that little tiny table there a tiny computer and one's a little crab see tiny food tiny utensils tiny liquor bottles tiny bathroom tiny sink tiny mirror tiny Crossman's so he's a small problem gonna be a slight delay we're gonna be a little late I always go in the airplane bathroom even if I don't have to go I got to go in there it's nice it's like your own little apartment on the plane isn't it go in there lock the door the life comes on after a second cycle it'll surprise party but I've always impressed with the amount of equipment that they have in that place I mean it's a little but they got the tissues towels closets compartments tiny slot for used razor blades they always have done it who is shaving on the plane and shaving so much they're using up razor blades is this what's happening what is the Wolfman flying in there for chrissakes who could shave that much higher so I'm supposed to go down to Florida next week after we're done here that's where all my relatives live I don't really want to go Florida not old people down there you know they live in those minimum security prisons that's where they put all the old people what's with all the security there with the guard gate with the arm coming down everyone's got a uniform guns are the old people trying to escape or are people stealing old people what is the security problem I just can't drive around there you know how the old people drive the drive slow they sit low that is their motto state flag of Florida should be just a steering wheel with a hat and two knuckles on and that left turn signal on for when they left the house that morning that's a legal turn in Florida it's known as an eventual left you can signal this week turn any following year of your life what does that age that old people reach where they decide when they back out of a driveway they're not looking anymore you know how they do that they just go well I'm old and I'm coming back I survive let's see if you can one thing I do like about being with my older relatives it makes me feel like a kid again you know they're feeding you you're trying to steal candy candy was my whole life when I was a kid that was first ten years of my life I think the only clear thought I had was getting candy that was a family friend school they're just obstacles in the way of the candy I'm out for the candy here I'm just thinking it can't eat candy it can they get candy good candidate that's why you have to teach kids not to take candy from a stranger if they're playing in a playground because there's such candy  idiot brains it's just this man s candy I'm going with them goodbye I don't care what happens to me get candy again don't go they'll talk to you they'll kidnap you it doesn't matter he hasn't oh Henry I have to take that chance it can be get Danny get Danny so the first time you hear the the concept of Halloween when you're a kid your brain can't even process the information you can be like what what is this what did you say so what did you say about giving out candy who was giving out to everyone that we know is just giving out candy are you kidding me when is this happening where why take me with you I gotta be a part of this I don't do anything that they want I can wear that I'll wear anything I have to wear I'll do anything I have to do to get the candy from those fools they're so stupidly giving it away so the first couple years I made my own costumes which of course suck the ghost the hobo no good then finally third year baking the parents got the Superman Halloween costume not surprisingly cardboard box cellophane top mask included remember the rubberband on the back of that mask that was a quality item there wasn't it that was good for about 10 seconds before it snapped out of that cheap little staple they put it in there with you go to your first house trick or snap but broke I don't believe it wait up you guys I got a fixed safe hey wait up wait up that's what you say they don't say wait they say wait up hey wait up because when you're little your life is up the future is up everything you want is up wait up hold up shut up mom I'll clean up let me stay parents of course is just the opposite everything is down just calm down slow down come down here sit down put that down so I had my little costume I was physically ready I was preparing myself I did not try on the costume prior to Halloween do you remember this is an obscure one but on the side of the box I remember this on my Superman costume it actually said do not attempt to fly they printed that as a warning because kids were putting it on going off the roof I love the idea of the kid who's stupid enough to think he actually is Superman but smart enough to check that box before he goes off the roof wait let me see if it says anything about me being Superman oh wait a second here I so anyway but my hopes were up I was thinking that this is probably the same exact costume that Superman wears himself you put these things on it's not exactly the super fit that you are hoping for it looks more like Superman's pajamas is what it looks like it's all kind of loose and flowing and the neckline kind of comes down about there flimsy little ribbon string in the back plus my mother makes me wear my winter coat over the costume anyway I don't recall Superman wearing it Jack not like I had cheap corduroy phony fur boy I'm Superman but it's a little chilly out and I'm glad I've got this cheap little ten-year-old kids jacket so I'm going out I'm trick-or-treating but the mask the rubber band keeps breaking it keeps getting shorter I'm fixing it it's getting tighter and tighter on my face you know what it starts slicing into your eyeballs there and you you're trying to breathe through that little hole getting all sweaty I can't see I can't breathe oh we got to keep going we got to get the kid eight and a half hour into we just take that mask off how are they Bing bong yeah it's me give me that candy yeah absalom Ann look at the pant legs what do you care who are those the last couple years trick-or-treating getting a little too old for it still out there going through the motions Bing bong come on Lady let's go Halloween doorbells candy let's pick it up and then come to the door they always ask you those same stupid questions what are you supposed to be I'm supposed to be done by now you want to move it along with the Three Musketeers I got 18 houses on this block sweetheart just hit the bag we hit the road that's the way it works sometimes they give me that little white bag twist it on the top you know that's gonna be some crap candy doesn't have the official Halloween markings on it hold it lady wait a second what is this the orange marshmallows shaped like a big peanut do me a favor you keep that one yeah we have all the doorstops we need already thank you we're going for named candy only this food is so complicated as an adult that's just where you see people in the supermarket they're just sweating it out nobody knows what do I eat the protein the carbs and the fat content oh my god fat content you're just walking up to each other you look pretty good what are you eating maybe I'll eat that the whole supermarket itself is designed to break down your sense of having any life outside the supermarket it's like a casino there's no clocks no windows no easily accessible exits you ever not buy anything in the supermarket and try and get out of there it's impossible there's no way out you can see what happens to people when they're walking up to the supermarket they really have a whole sense of purpose I'm gonna get this I'm gonna get that I'm gonna pay for it I'm gonna get out of here go right back to my normal life you see that same person ten minutes later just what I was this why did I come up here I always noticing something new oh my god I'm in a mesquite flavor now what is Mesquite wonder if it's made from mosquitoes protists section I always find very challenging is always some special thing you're supposed to know you know about each fruit the summer time make sure your peaches are I don't know whatever it is you gotta fake it you know I'm shaking stuff holding it up to the light yeah that's a good one sure glad I found that one cantaloupes roll them down the aisle see the way that's fading left that one's not ready I don't want that one I'm very impressed with this seedless watermelon product that they have for us they've done it we now have seedless watermelon pretty amazing what are they planting to grow the seedless watermelon I wonder the melons aren't humping are they they must be planting something how does this work and what kind of scientist do this type of work I read a thing was 15 years in development in the laboratories with you know gene splicing or whatever they do there I don't know I mean other scientists working on AIDS cancer heart disease these guys ago and now I'm gonna devote myself to Mellon I think that's much more important sure thousands are dying needlessly but this that's got to stop you ever try and pick up a wet one off the floor it's almost impossible I really think we should devote the money to these studies milk is a big problem for people in the supermarket they're never quite sure if they have it if they need it they bury it way in the back in the supermarket you got to find it you got to hack your way through all the displays well there it is there's the milk do we have any mail people are never really sure if they have milk think you have milk we might have I know there's a carton in there I don't know how much is it well what should we do cuz you want to be sure there's nothing worse than thinking you have milk I'm not happy you know you got the bowl set up the cereal to spoon the napkin the TV the newspaper everything's ready to go you're gonna lift up the cart and it's too light to light or sometimes you think you need milk hey we better pick up some milk like many of you were thinking right now you know he's right maybe we should pick up some money so you'll pick up some milk on the way home and then you'll discover you already had milk and now you got way too much milk that's no good either now it's a race against the clock with the expiration date that freaky thing now you're eating giant punch bowls of cereal three meals a day you're washing your face with milk bringing cats in from all over the neighborhood hurry up and drink it come on it's almost get it back over here how do they know that that is the definite exact day you know they don't say like it's in the vicinity give or take roughly they brand it right into the side of the carton then that's your goddamn day right there oh don't screw with us we know what day is the final day and then it is so never have milk the day after the day scares the hell out of you doesn't it this spoon is trembling as it comes out of the bowl it's after the day I'm taking a big chance I smelled it you smell it what is it supposed to smell like smell like milk to me I don't know how they're so definite though maybe the cows tip them off when they're milking them July 3rd  you mean the only thing tougher than the supermarket is the drugstores drugstore is really challenging because you have no idea what they're talking about you know you're just looking at in Green's I had a cold a couple weeks ago so I go in there and I'm looking it's just like the entire wall is cold medication you know and you can't understand anything so you're just reading in greens you ever catch yourself reading ingredients in a drugstore no this has point O three tetrahydrozoline yeah that's a good amount of that but it's so hard to figure out sometimes you know they have like this one's quick acting this one's long-lasting when do I need to feel good now or later I don't know they always tell you how the medicine works on TV you know the commercials that's my favorite part where the guy says here's the human body so he's this guy you know this guy no face mouth open this is our drug company see the public he's always got the tube coming down here and then the circle area these are the complex inner workings of the human body I assume I'm sure when you go to medical school they put that up on the board the first day okay everyone now remember you've got your tube coming down from the mouth and that goes into your circle area that's pretty much all we know that's it for today don't miss tomorrow we're gonna practice making people wait in a little room in their underwear and then you'll all be doctors that's all there is to it then they have to show you the pain you know that part where they say here's where you hurt pain is usually represented by some sort of lightning attack in the guy glowing redness is popular sometimes parts of the guy's body will just burst into flames sometimes the whole guy is like out of focus I never had a doctor say to me are you having any pain yes I am are you having any lightning with the pain have you been in a funhouse mirror at any time then they tell you about the pain relieving ingredient there's always got to be a lot of that nobody wants anything less than extra strength extra strength is the absolute minimum you can't even get strength strength is out now it's all extra strength some people not satisfied with extra they want maximum give me the maximum strength give me the maximum allowable human dosage figure out what will kill me and then back it off a little bit and why does that pharmacist have to be two and a half feet higher than everybody else who the hell is this guy clear out everybody I'm working with pills up here I'm taking them from this big bottle then I'm gonna put them in a little bottle that's my whole job I can't be down on the floor with you people yes I'd like to get this prescription filled please all right but you wait down there no one comes up here but me that little bit of arrogance in the medical community I think we could all live without like when you go to see the doctor you don't see the actual doctor first you must wait in the waiting room there's no chance of not waiting that's the name of the room the doctors are all back though we can't take them now we've already got this room you sit there you pretend you reading your little magazine you're actually looking at the other people you know wonder what he's got that guy's a goner then they call it you get very excited when they call you cuz you think now you're gonna see the doctor but you're not now you're going into the next smaller waiting room now you don't even have your magazine now you got your pants around your ankles you're sitting on that butcher paper they pull out over the table sometimes I bring a pickle with me and I put it next to me right there on the table I don't know case the doctor wants to fold the whole thing up for it to go order get your pants off and get in there and I will tell you what I think doctors always want your pants off take your pants off doctor would like to see you with no pants just get them off it's my head I said take your pants off but I hate the extra way so I started maybe I'll start screwing around with some of his stuff you know maybe I'll turn that thing up a little bit whatever the hell that does take all the tongue depressors out lick them all put them all back there yeah two can play at this waiting King just once I'd like to say to the doctor you know what I'm not ready for you yet why don't you go back in your little office I'll be in in a minute and get your pants off then we'll see what's what why is the doctor need that little office for anyway you know his books little stupid aquarium I guess he doesn't want people to see him looking stuff up what the hell was that Jesus crying that was kind of gross that wasn't the tube or the circle my friend of mine is going in for nose job next week guy knows too you know what the technical term for a nose job is well what you do what's New York everybody rhinoplasty rhino now this guy is aware he has a bit of a problem he's obviously sensitive about it that's why he made the appointment do we need to compare him to a rhinoceros when you go for a hair transplant they don't say we're going to perform a cueball ectomy on you mr. Johnson we feel the chrome-dome iya has advanced to a level we terms can hediye these are all medical terms that you don't need understand of course everybody wants to look their best we're all out there money wants to look good guys gal sexuality I am a single guy by the way there are no other guys attached to me thank you very much thank you I love you too but I do feel the need to see other people I was uh I got engaged about ten or so years ago didn't want to get married that was the only closest I got I can tell you this if you're engaged and you don't want to get married it's a little tense it's like you're on that first Hill of the roller coaster but you don't really want to go on the ride you're just going click click click I was best man the wedding one time that was pretty good pretty good title I thought best man I thought it was bit much I thought wait up the groom and a pretty good man that's more than enough if I'm the best man why is she marrying him Adam wear the tuxedo which I'm convinced was invented by a woman well they're all the same we might as well dress them all the same the tuxedo also functions as a wedding safety device for the bride case the groom chickens out everybody could just take one step over when the ceremony continues that's why they don't say do you take Dave Williams to be your lawfully wedded husband they say do you take this man but men and women will never understand each other we all know that it's just not gonna happen just forget it I know I will not understand women I know I will never be able to understand how a woman could take boiling hot wax poured on her upper thighs with the hair out by the root and still be afraid of a spider I'm not spending any more time working on that and I know women don't understand men I know there are women that are looking at me right now going I wonder what goes on that little brain of his I bet you I could manipulate that brain I bet you you could I bet you would like to know what men are really thinking the truth the honest truth of what men are really thinking because I could tell you would you like to know alright I'll tell you  we're not thinking anything we're just walking around looking around this is the only natural inclination of man just kind of check stuff out we work because they force us to but other than that this is the really the only thing we want to do we like women we want women but that's pretty much as far as we thought that's why we're honking car horns yelling from construction sites these are the best ideas we've had so far honking the car horn amazes me this has got to be just the last living brain cell on this guy's skull that comes up with this idea I don't understand the guy Phoebe I think I made my point what is she supposed to do kick off the heels start running after the car grab onto the bumper car comes to a stop it's a good thing you honked I had no idea how you felt why do men behave in these ways why are we rude I'm not just getting drunk falling down peeling rubber making kissing noises out the window why are we like this I know what you ladies are thinking no no not my guy I'm working with him he's coming along no he's not he's not coming anywhere we men know no matter how poorly we behave it seems we will somehow end up with women anyway look around this room look at all the men you see with lovely women do you think these are special men gifted men one-of-a-kind men they're the same jerks and idiots that I'm talking about they're doing just fine men as an organization are getting more women than any other group working anywhere in the world today forever women are we have men looking into the situation right now we explored the earth looking for women even went to the moon just see if there was any women there that's why we brought that little car why would you bring a car unless there's some chance of going on a date what the hell were they doing with a car on the goddamn moon you're on the moon already isn't that far enough there is no more male idea in the history of the universe then why don't we fly up to the moon and drive around that is the essence of male thinking right there because all men kind of think of themselves as like low-level superheroes in their own world I'm not even supposed to be telling you this but when men are growing up and they're reading about Batman spider-man Superman these aren't fantasies these are options this is the deep inner secret truth of the male mind I'll give you a perfect example of what I'm talking about you ever see a guy out on the highway moving a mattress tied to the roof of the car without fail he's got the arm out the window holding the mattress this is classic male idiot superhero thinking this  believes if the wind catches this huge rectangle at 70 miles an hour I got it I got don't worry about I'm using my ah but I'm sure there are many dates going on in this room right now dating is not easy what is the date really but a job interview that lasts all night only difference between a date and a job interview is not many job interviews is there a chance you'll end up naked at the end of it well bill the boss thinks you're the man for the position why don't you strip down meet some of the people you'll be working with sex doesn't make anything any easier even only makes it more complicated women have two types of orgasms the actual"
Jerry Seinfeld,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAsBk9Eia8A,"Do you know what this is all 
about, do you know why we're here?   To be out, this is out, and out is one of 
the single most enjoyable experiences of life.   People, do you have people talk about ""we should 
go out?"", this is what they're talking about.   This whole thing we're all out now no 
one is home, not one person here is home,   we're all out. There are people trying 
to find us, they don't know where we are.   Did you read I can't find him where did he 
go he didn't tell me where he was going,   he must have gone out. You want to go out, you 
get ready, you pick out the clothes, right, you   take the shower, get all ready, get the cash, get 
your friends, the car, the spot, the reservation.   So you stand around what do you do, you go ""we 
gotta be getting back"", once you're out you want   to get back. You want to go to sleep you want to 
get up, you want to go out again tomorrow, right?   Wherever you are in life it's my feeling you've 
got to go. So I'm on in line at the supermarket.   Two women in front of me. One of them 
her total was eight dollars, the other   three dollars, they both of course 
choose to pay by the use of the   cheque. Now, the fact is if it is a woman in front 
of you that's writing out the cheque, you will not   be waiting long. I have noticed that women are 
very fast with cheques you know because they write   out so many cheques. The keys they can never find 
in their purse, they don't know where that is,   but the chequebook they got that they 
never fumble for the chequebook they've   got the chequebook comes out of a holster, 
who do i make it out to. There's my ID,   there's something about a cheque that to a man 
it's not masculine I don't know exactly what it   is i think to a man a cheque is like a note from 
your mother that says i don't have any money but   if you contact these people I'm sure they'll stick 
up for me if you could just trust me this one time   I don't have any money, but I have these, I 
wrote on these, is this of any value at all? So i move into the settling now i get ahead of 
this woman who felt for some reason i guess that   she thought that i cut her off so she pulls 
up alongside him he gives me the finger it   seems like such an arbitrary ridiculous thing to 
just pick a finger and you show it to the person it's a finger what does it mean 
someone shows me one of their fingers   and i'm supposed to feel bad is that the way 
it's supposed to work i mean you could just give   someone the toe really couldn't you i would feel 
worse if i got the toe than if i got the thing   because it's not easy to give someone the toe you 
got to get the shoe off the sock off and drive   get it up in the look at that toe buddy i mean 
that's really insulting to get the toe isn't it   most men like working on things. Tools, objects, 
fixing things, this is what men enjoy doing   have you ever noticed if a guy's out in his 
driveway working on something with tools   how all the other men in the neighborhood 
are magnetically drawn to this activity   they just come wandering out 
of the house like zombies   men it's true, men hear a drill 
it's like a dog whistle just you know they go running up to that living 
room curtain, ""honey i think Jim's working on something over there"" So, they run over to 
the guy now they don't actually help the guy   no they just want to hang around the area where 
work is being done that's what men want to do. We want to watch the guy we want to talk to him 
we want to ask him dumb questions you know, What, are you using a Philips there? 
You know, we feel involved. That's why when they have construction sites, they have to have those wood panel fences 
around them, that's just to keep the men out.   they cut those little holes for us so 
we can see what the hell is going on,   but if they don't cut those holes 
we are climbing those fences   right over there what are you 
using the steel girders down here? yeah that'll hold Went out to dinner the other night, check came at 
the end of the meal as it always does. Never liked   the check at the end of the meal system because 
money is a very different thing before and after   you eat before you eat money has no value now you 
don't care about money when you're hungry you sit   down in a restaurant you like the ruler of an 
empire more drinks appetizers, quickly, quickly!   It will be the greatest meal of our lives. Then 
after the meal you know you got the pants open   you got the napkins destroyed, 
cigarette butt in the mashed potatoes.   Then, the check comes at that moment People are always upset, you know?
Mystified by the check. What is this? How could this be? They start passing it around the table does this look right to you we're not 
hungry now why are we buying all this food? I'm always in traffic with the lame expert you 
know this type of person constantly re-evaluating   their lane choice never quite sure is this 
the best lane for me, for my life?   They're always little bit ahead of you can i get in over there, can i get ahead of you can i get in there? Yeah, come on over here pal we're zooming over here, this is the secret lane nobody knows about it.   The ultimate, I think the ultimate psychological 
test of traffic is the total dead stop not even   rolling and you look out the window you can see 
gum clearly but we know that in the future traffic   will get even worse than that, I mean what will 
happen will it start moving backwards i wonder.   I mean is that possible that someday we'll be 
going ""boy this is some really bad traffic now, boy   this is really bad I'm gonna try and get 
off and get back on going the other way"" My parents live in Florida now they moved there 
last year they didn't want to move to Florida   but they're in their 60s and that's the law. You 
know how it works they got the leisure police   they pull up in front of the old people's house 
with a golf cart, jump out ""let's go pop white belt   white pants white shoes get in the back drop 
the snow shovel right there drop it"" I am not   much for the family gathering you ever think 
the conversation is so boring it's so   dull and you start to fantasize you know you think 
what if i just got up and jumped out that window   you know just crashed right through the 
glass you know come back in this broken   glass everybody's all upset no I'm all right i was 
just a little bored there no I'm fine I came back   i wanted to hear a little more about that hummel 
collection, aunt Rose let's pick it up right there. I hate clothes, okay. I hate buying them I hate 
picking them out of my closet i can't stand every   day trying to come up with little outfits for 
myself i think eventually fashion won't even exist   it won't i think eventually we'll all be wearing 
the same thing because any time i see a movie or   a tv show where there's people from the future or 
another planet they're all wearing the same thing   somehow they decided this is going to be our 
outfit one piece silver jumpsuit v-stripe and   boots that's it. We should come up with an outfit 
for earth an earth outfit we should vote on it   candidates propose different 
outfits no speeches they walk out   twirl walk off we just sit in the audience 
and go that was nice i could wear that the bad thing about television is that everybody 
you see on television is doing something   better than what you're doing you never 
see anyone on tv like just sliding off   the front of the sofa with potato chip crumbs 
on their face some people have a little too   much fun on television the soda commercial 
people where do they summon this enthusiasm   have you seen them we have soda we have soda we 
have soda jumping laughing flying through the air   it's a can of soda have you ever been standing 
there and you're watching tv and you're drinking   the exact product that they're advertising right 
there on tv and it's like you know they're spiking   volleyballs jet skiing girls and bikinis and i'm 
saying maybe i'm putting too much ice in mine   well i painted my apartment again i've been 
living in this apartment for years and years   and every time i paint it it kind of gets 
me down i look around and i think well it's   a little bit smaller now you know i realize it's 
just the thickness of the paint but i'm aware of   it it just keeps coming in and coming in every 
time i paint it it's closer and closer i don't   even know where the wall outlets are anymore i 
just look for like a lump with two slots in it   kind of looks like a pig is trying to push his way 
through from the other side that's where i plug in my idea of the perfect living room would 
be the bridge on the starship enterprise   you know what i mean big chair nice screen 
remote control that's why star trek really   was the ultimate male fantasy just hurtling 
through space in your living room watching tv that's why all the aliens were always 
dropping in because kirk was the only   one that had the big screen they come over 
friday nights klingon boxing gotta be there i have to tell you that i did get some very 
exciting news recently and i don't know if   i should really tell you exactly what it is 
because it's really not a definite thing yet well i will tell you what i do know so far 
according to the information that i have   in the envelope that i received it seems that i 
may have already won some very valuable prizes   well thank you thank you very much well thank you 
that's very nice to hear that but in all honesty   i have to say i don't even 
know i was in this thing   but according to the readout it looks like i am 
among the top people that they are considering   you know that's annoys me about sweepstakes 
companies they always tease you with that   you may have already won i'd like once where 
sweepstakes come and have some guts come out   with the truth just tell people the truth one 
time send out envelopes you have definitely lost you turn it over giant printing not 
even close you open it up there's   this whole letter of explanation even we cannot 
believe how badly you've done in this contest whenever i see the news and they're 
uh they're hauling in some criminal   terrorist psycho maniac master murderer guy you 
know he's always covering up his face with the   newspaper with the jacket with the hat what 
is he worried about what i mean what is this   man's reputation that he has to worry about 
this kind of exposure damaging his good name   i mean i mean what is the upper big job 
promotion down at the office or something   and afraid the boss is going to catch this on 
tv and go isn't that johnson from sales he's up   in that clock tower picking people off one by 
one i don't know if that's the kind of man we   want heading up that new branch office he should 
be in bill collection i think he's got half two you know i tell you i gotta say that i'm enjoying 
adulthood for a lot of reasons and i'll tell you   reason number one as an adult if i want a cookie 
i have a cookie okay i have three cookies or four   cookies or 11 cookies if i want many times 
i will intentionally ruin my entire appetite   just ruin it and then i call my mother 
up right after to tell that i did it   oh mom yeah i just ruined 
my entire appetite cookies so whatever you ruined because as an 
adult we understand even if you ruin   an appetite there's another 
appetite coming right behind   there's no danger in running out of appetite i've 
got millions of them i ruin them whenever i want i was watching women in the department store 
the other day trying on clothes and i noticed   that they do it differently from men women don't 
try on the clothes they get behind the clothes   they take a dress off the rack and they hold it 
up against themselves they can tell something from   this they stick one leg way out because they need 
to know if someday i'm one legged at a 45 degree   angle what am i gonna wear you never see a man do 
that you never see a guy take a suit off the rack   put his head in the neck and go what do you 
think about this suit i think i'll get it   yeah it looks fine put some shoes by the bottom 
of the pants i want to make sure yeah perfect   now what if i'm walking. Move the shoes, move 
the shoes, move the shoes, move the shoes. Men uh flip around the television more than women 
I think men get that remote control in their hands   they don't even know what the hell they're not 
watching. You know they just keep going or even i   want to watch you hey guys what are you watching 
I don't care I got to keep going who was that I   don't know what it was doesn't matter isn't that 
your father, it doesn't matter I gotta keep going! women don't do that see now women will stop 
and go well let me see what the show is before   I change the channel. You see but men just fly 
because women you see women nest and men hunt   That's why we watch TV differently before there was uh flipping around before there 
was television kings and emperors and pharaohs   and such had uh storytellers that would tell them 
stories and that was their entertainment i always   wondered in that era they would get like 30 
storytellers together so they could still   flip around just go all right start telling me 
your story what's happening I don't wanna hear   anymore shut up throw the next day what are you 
talking about, is there a girl in that story, no   shut up. Go to the next guy what do you got
I don't want to hear that either shut up now   go ahead what are you talking about, I don't want to hear that. 
No the hell with you, get out of here, I'm going to bed. I'm on the street the other day, make a pay 
phone call go over time on the call hang up the   phone, walk away. You've had this happen? What, phone 
rings, it's the phone company, they want more money.   Don't you love this, and you've got them right 
where you want them for the first time in your   life you're on the street there's nothing they 
can do i like to let it ring a few times you know   let her sweat a little over there and just pick 
it up ""yeah hello operator, oh I've got the money I've got the money right here. You hear that, 
that's a quarter, yeah you want that don't you? I'm not a foodie. I don't oh this is too rare oh 
it's too salty just eat it and shut up. I'll eat anywhere,   whatever they're having, I have eaten rolls 
off of room service trays in hotel hallways   I have, that's not a joke, this is my life. I don't know, somebody left it what is this, why would 
somebody poison a roll, and leave it in the hallway   and some comic coming down at two o'clock in 
the morning, why would they do that? Sometimes you go to a nice restaurant, they put the check in a little book, what is this the story of the bill? Once upon a time there were some 
very hungry people, what is this?   little gold tassel hanging down am i graduating 
from the restaurant what is this about? It's very hard to find the store that you 
want in the mall, they have the directory, but the   problem with it is, even if you figure out where 
you are and where you want to go, you still don't   really know sometimes which way to walk because 
it's an upright map. If you had like suction   cup feet that you could just walk right up on it 
then you could tell you could just be on it going   all right I'm here i want to go to the gap that's 
down there all right and I'll just walk that way. But people would know, they would
see you walking down the wall going: ""That's one of those suction cup guys, I've heard about that guy. He's never lost."" you know there's like always one 
location in your neighborhood   one store location that's constantly 
changing hands everybody has this in   their neighbourhood it's a leather store then 
it's a yogourt shop and it's a pet supply   it's like constantly changing and nobody 
can do business there it's like some sort of   bermuda triangle of retail you know stores open 
up and then they just disappear without a trace   nobody knows what happened to him i guess 
eventually when like aliens land and the   mothership from close encounters the bottom will 
slowly open and all these store owners will come   wandering out and the day is going i thought there 
was going to be more walk-in traffic, didn't you? the transplant the hair plug is an interesting 
procedure it's really quite amazing hair that   was on your shower soap yesterday can be in 
your head tomorrow how do they do the first   transplant did they have the guy take a shower get 
his soap rush it in there by helicopter you know   keep the soap alive on the soap support system 
eventually move it over we got the hairs but   i think we lost the zest sometimes the 
body rejects the transplant with organs   is it possible that a head could reject a hair 
transplant the guy's just standing around somebody lands in someone's frozen yogurt You give me an explanation as to why the 
pharmacist has to be two and a half feet up   above everybody else what the hell is he doing he 
can't be down there on the floor with you and me   brain surgeons airline pilots nuclear 
physicists we're all on the same level   oh no he's got to be two and a half feet 
up look out everybody I'm working with   spread out give me some room the only hard 
part of his whole job that I could see   is typing everything onto that little tiny 
label it has to try and get all the words on   there keep the paper and the little piece 
of paper in the roller of the typewriter   oh no he's got to be two and a half feet 
up yeah I'd like to get this prescription all right you wait down there 
only I'm allowed up here. So i was in the drugstore the other 
day trying to get a cold medication   do you ever try and pick one of these out not 
easy it's a wall it's an entire wall of cold   medication you're standing there you're 
going all right all right all right okay this is quick acting but this is long-lasting 
when do i need to feel good now or later   it's a tough question and then we show you 
the commercials on tv where they show you   what's wrong with the guy you know and they 
always show you like all the problems that   he said first of all i always show you 
the human body which is usually this guy no face mouth open this is how 
drug companies see the public   and he's always in like a certain pain it's 
like a red wavy lines are going through him   you know or he's glowing parts of him are on fire 
sometimes lightning is attacking him i never had   a doctor say to me are you having any pain yes 
i am are you having any lightning with the pain   It seems to me the way they design the car 
alarm is so that the car will behave   as if it was a nervous hysterical person 
anyone goes near it anyone disturbs it   i don't know all crazy not everyone wants to draw 
that much attention to themselves wouldn't it be   nice if you could have a car alarm that 
was a little more subtle maybe just you every mall has a hot fritz in it i'm sorry there's 
got to be a little bit of a scary place to work   i don't know how you feel about it you want to be 
standing in there having people coming in all day   going i need knives i need more knives do you have 
any bigger knives i'd like a bigger knife a big   long sharp knife that's what i'm in the market for 
i like them really sharp you have one with hooks   and gouges like blades that's kind of serrated and 
that's the kind of knife i'm looking for i need   one i can throw i need another one i can just 
hack away with do you have anything like that when i was a kid my favorite ride was uh bumper 
car ride remember that ride going around in a   circle it was always one kid on the bumper cars 
that could not do it do you remember this kid   as soon as the ride gets started he'd 
be like stuck in a pack of empty cars excuse me excuse me it won't 
go come on it's almost over he always ends up with the attendant hanging 
off that big pole helping him steer it stop crying that other one other really 
bad car the helpless father and son team   this is another car just not going 
anywhere they're never organized   who's on the wheel who's pressing 
on the gas they're just oh women uh put on their perfume in an 
interesting way i love watching them   do that you ever notice that guys and they have 
those they're little key stratego little areas   places they think we're going and they always hit this one women are 
convinced that this is the most action-packed   area that could ever happen in the dating 
world what what is that lady what is happening   here is that in case you slap the guy or 
something he still finds you intriguing chanel i'm going to get a physical examination 
to me that you're in sample giving them that   that's always a pleasure isn't it then 
there's always the amount question i   don't know what you need i mean that's uh 
i gave you whatever i had there that's uh   i got more i mean whatever you need i can get it 
for you just let me know what you need i mean it's   no problem i mean but any kind of physical test i 
don't know what it is i always kind of click into   this thing i want to do really well you know if 
it's going to be a physical test i want to do well   you know like remember when you're in school 
and they do those hearing tests and you really   can really be listening you know trying to 
do really trying to do well i want to do   well you know i want to do unbelievable on 
the hearing test i wanted them to come over   to me after the hearing test and go we think 
you may have something close to super hearing   what you heard was a cotton 
ball touching a piece of felt   we're sending the results to washington 
we'd like you to meet the president i'll tell you i never really 
understood the importance   of the conductor i mean between you and me 
what the hell is this guy doing do you really   need somebody waving a stick in your face to 
play the violin does that really help you out   i can see how we need him at the beginning okay 
tap tap tap start okay i can see how you need   that but once we're gone okay once it's all 
happening what what do we need him for then i   don't see the chalice looking up go i'm confused 
i don't know what to do i don't know what to do   and the conductor go do this this like 
this oh okay thank you thank you very much   see to me you go in the health club you see 
all these people and they're working out   and they're training and they're getting in shape 
but the strange thing is nobody's really getting   in shape for anything the only reason that you're 
getting in shape is that so you can get through   the workout so we're working out so that we'll 
be in shape for when we have to do our exercise   this is the whole thing the other 
thing i don't get about it is   why we're so careful about locking up 
our dirty towels and smelly jock straps   what exactly is the black market on these 
disgusting gym clothes i'll give my car to   any valet guy in front of a restaurant because 
he's got a short red jacket yeah he must be   the valet i don't even think about it but my 
stinking putrified gym clothes i got one of these   got one of these locks you could put a bullet 
through it and it won't open that stuff is safe   do you think that the people at the airport that 
run the stores have any idea what the prices are   every place else in the world or do you think they 
just feel they have their own little country out   there and they can charge anything they want 
you're hungry tuna sandwiches nine dollars   you don't like it go back to your own country 
i think the whole airport airline complex is   a huge scam just to sell the tuna sandwiches 
i think that profit is what's supporting the   whole air travel industry i mean think about 
it the terminals the airplanes it's all just   a distraction so that you don't notice the 
beating that you're taking on the tuner phone i would say the concept behind the car 
phone and the phone machine the speakerphone   the airline phone the portable phone 
the pay phone the cordless phone the   multi-line phone the phone pager the call 
waiting call forwarding call conferencing   speed dialing direct dialing in the redialing 
is that we all have absolutely nothing to say   and we've got to talk to someone about 
it right now cannot wait another second   i mean come on you're at home you're on the 
phone you're in the car you're making calls   you get to work any messages for me you gotta 
give people a chance to miss you a little do you think that the security guards 
in the art museums really ever stop   anybody from taking the paintings i mean 
are they going up to hey hey what do you   think you going with that hey come over 
here come over here give me that saison   i mean look at the job that this man is hired to 
do he's getting five dollars an hour to protect   millions of dollars of priceless art with 
what he's got a light mocha brown uniform   and the usa today this is what he's got i mean 
crooks must look at this guy and go all right   all we got to do is get past the folding chair 
and the thermos of coffee we can get a rembrandt parking lots now they have this compact car 
only spot isn't that discrimination against   the size of your car if i want my ass hanging out 
of the back of my parking spot that's my business   there are people out there with real asses 
hanging out of their pants nobody's stopping them nobody goes hey hold it sir those are 
compact jeans you can't pull that in there i bought the ginsu knife i did buy the ginsu 
knife i know i can't believe it but i did i   swear i saw it it was late at night i'm watching 
the thing and and it started making sense to me   i'm thinking yeah cut through the shoe cut 
through the cane i want them so i called up   the number on the screen you know and i said i'd 
like to order the ginsu and the lady went really   i mean even against you people have given up it's 
really so sad you know i mean i guess to be honest   i mean if you need a knife that can cut through a 
shoe perhaps you're not buying the highest grade   of meat currently available you know maybe you 
ought to think about not getting the hook cut   once in a while it's amazing to me that 
people will move thousands of miles away   to another city they think nothing of it they're 
gonna plan boom they're there they live there now   that's why i'm living over there you know pioneers 
it took years to cross the country now people will   move thousands of miles just for one season and 
i don't think any pioneers did that you know   it took us a decade to get there and uh we 
stayed for the summer it was nice i had a   pool the kids loved it and then we left 
about 10 years ago and we just got back   we had a great summer and took us 
20 years and now our lives are over   parents like to drag kids to these 
historical sites uh on vacation i remember   going to uh colonial williamsburg you see 
the supposedly authentic blacksmith there   you know he's got the three cornered hat 
and the knickers and the def leppard t-shirt   my parents took me to the amish country which to a 
kid you know to see a bunch of people that have no   cars no tv no phone they go so what neither do i 
it's just a whole community that's been grounded   that's the way they should punish the kids after 
they take them home all right son get up to your   room that's it i've had it you are amish young man 
for the rest of this weekend did you hear me amish   don't come down do you make 
some noodles and raise a bar   my parents had two constant arguments while 
they were driving over either how fast my   father was going or how much gas was left in 
the tank my father had a standard defense for   either one of these it was always that's 
because you're looking at it from an angle if you were over here it looks from where you're 
sitting it looks like i'm doing 90 on empty   but that's because you're over there if you're 
over here you'd know i'm in the driveway with   the full tank it's an entire industry of bad gifts 
aren't they all those executive gifts any stupid   goofy brass wood thing they put a piece of green 
felt on the bottom it's a golf desk tie and stress   organizer dad well i mean nothing compares with 
the paperweight as a bad gift there's no better   way than a paperweight to express to someone 
that i refuse to put any thought into this at all   where are these people working that the papers 
are just blowing right off of their desks   or they're just screwed to the back of a flatbed 
truck going down the highway or something   what are they typing up in the crow's nest of a 
clipper ship what do you need a paper weight for   have you ever called someone up and you're 
disappointed when they answer the phone   you wanted the machine you know and you're 
always kind of thrown off you go oh i uh   i i didn't know you were there i just wanted 
to leave a message saying sorry i missed you   so here what we have is two people hate 
each other don't really ever want to talk   but the phone machine is like this relationship 
respirator keeping these marginal brain dead   relationships alive and we all do it why so that 
when we come home you can see that little flashing   red light you go all right messages people need 
that it's very important for human beings to   feel they are popular and well liked amongst 
a large group of people that we don't care for   i don't think people think of their office as a 
workplace i think they think of it as a stationery   store with danish you know what you mean you want 
to get your pastry your envelopes your supplies   your toilet paper six cups of coffee and you 
go home why do people that work in offices   have pictures of their family on their desk 
facing them do they forget that they're married   do they go all right five o'clock time to hit 
the bars and pick up some hookers hold it a   i second a wife and three kids i 
better get home completely forgot i think the idea behind a tuxedo is kind of the 
woman's point of view that men are all the same   we might as well dress them that way 
that's why to me a wedding is like   the joining together of a beautiful 
glowing bride and some guy the tuxedo   is a wedding safety device created 
by women because they know that men   are undependable so in case the groom chickens out 
everybody just takes one step over and she marries   the next guy that's why the wedding vow isn't do 
you take bill simpson it's do you take this man there's no easy way to break 
off any relationship i think   when you first start dating they ought to give 
you three get out of relationship free cards   you know what i mean so you could 
just go up to the person and go   uh here you go i'm sorry i'll grab the tennis 
racket don't even bother to get up have a good one which is fine unless of course the person you're 
in the relationship with happens to have a   eight more months of guilt torture and pain 
card uh hold up i got a little something for you you don't really want to visualize your parents 
having sex you know what i mean it's somehow   a very uncomfortable thing you know in your 
mind that they had to have sex at least once   to have you but you still kind of maintain 
the image in your head well i don't know i'm   not positive i can't prove it i don't know if 
that actually happened that's why i think if   i found that i was adopted that would really 
come as great news i'm a doctor that's great   i'd be happy to hear that that means technically 
it's possible that my mother and my father are   really just really great friends i mean sex 
is great but you don't want to think that   your whole life began because somebody maybe had a 
little too much wine with dinner have you noticed   that everything on planes is very tiny there's 
always tiny food tiny liquor bottles tiny pillows   tiny bathroom tiny sink tiny soap everyone's 
in a cramped seat working on a tiny computer   there's always a small problem being slightly 
a bit late if you could be a little patient   we're just trying to get one of those little 
trucks to pull us up a little closer to the   jet way so you can walk down the narrow hallway 
there'll be a man there in a tight suit he'll   tell you you have very little time to 
make your connecting flight so move it   so i went to a fashion show first of all the 
whole concept of modeling is counterproductive   to the fashion industry because when these 
women are around who's looking at clothes   i didn't notice any of the clothes we're all 
applauding yeah where are we employing there's   great looking women here yeah this is great 
i'm glad i'm here in this room with all these   great looking women anybody can design a shirt it 
takes talent to get all these girls in one spot   that's talent what is this goofy walk that 
the models do you know this walk that they do   down the runway this like they have to go 
somewhere you know they're walking like they're   like they're really on the way somewhere you 
know and then they get to the end and it's like   well i guess i'll just go back what is with the 
age gap hiring policy at most movie theaters every   night they never hire anyone between the ages of 
15 and 80. you know what i mean like the girl that   sells you the ticket she's 10 then there's the 
guy that ripped it he's 102. what happened in   the middle they couldn't find anybody it's like 
they want to show you how life comes full circle   you know you're 15 you're selling 
the tickets then you leave you go   out you have a family kids marriage career 
grandchildren 80 years later you're back   at the same theater three feet away ripping 
tickets took you 80 years to move three feet   what are lawyers really to me a lawyer is 
basically the person that knows the rules   of the country we're all throwing the dice playing 
the game moving our pieces around the board but if   there's a problem the lawyer is the only person 
that has read the inside of the top of the box   i think one of the fun things for 
them is to say objection objection   objection your honor objection of course 
is the adult version of frayed not to which the judge can say two things he can say 
overruled which is the adult version of freight so   or you can say sustained which 
is the adult version of duh the basic problem uh with the beginning of 
the relationship i think is that each person   has their own sexual timetable of what should 
happen when that the other person knows nothing   about that's why i really think we need some 
sort of sexual rule book where it's written   down and agreed upon sexual standard dating 
procedure you know what i mean so if there's   any problems you can go look honey i'm very sorry 
but uh we've been out three times and according   to article seven section five there's got to 
be some physical contact as you can see right   there otherwise i will report you to the board 
and they can put out a warrant for an embrace i am getting a little tired of pretending i'm 
excited every time it's somebody's birthday you   know what i mean what is the big deal 
how many times do we have to celebrate   that someone was born every year over and 
over all you did was not die for 12 months   that's all you've done as far as i could 
tell i know those astrology things where   they they tell you all the people 
that have the same birthday as you   it's an odd group of people too isn't it it's 
like ed asner elijah muhammad and secretariat   the life expectancy now is uh 72 i think for men 
75 or six or something for women it's amazing to   think that just a couple thousand years ago 
life expectancy was 30 which in our terms   would mean that you get your driver's license 
around five married at nine divorced at fifteen   in your late teens you moved down to florida i 
guess that's how spring break got started i don't   know and then eventually people are saying things 
about you like oh it's amazing he's 28 but he's   still very alert his mind is so sharp you would 
think you're talking to a two-year-old i don't   belong to a health club i have a strict limit on 
the number of naked men i need to see in one day zero that's it what is with the high level 
of security at the health club do you mean   the picture ids the security guards people 
signing in and out what is this the kremlin   i mean the people that have a membership 
go twice a year who's breaking in   is this a big problem people stealing exercise   and what if they catch the person what then they 
run it's a aerobic makes it even worse you can't   just have an adultery you commit adultery and you 
can't even commit adultery unless you already have   a commitment so you have to make the commitment 
before you can even think about committing it   there's no commit without the commit then once 
you commit then you can commit the adultery then   you can get caught get divorced lose your mind and 
they have you committed but you know some people   actually cheat on the people that they're cheating 
with which is like you know being in a hold up   and then turning to the robber next to you and 
going all right give me everything you have too whenever you ask for the doggy bag in a restaurant 
there's a certain sense of failure there isn't it   people always whisper it to the waiter excuse me 
i'm sorry you're gonna have to give me the donkey   back i couldn't make it and it is embarrassing 
because the doggy bag means either you are out   at a restaurant when you're not hungry or you've 
chosen the stupidest possible way to get dog food   that there is how about the doggy bag on a date 
that's a good move for a guy huh if you're a guy   you asked for the doggy bag on a date you might 
as well have them just wrap up your genitals too   you're not going to be needing those for a while 
either i have a friend that's about to get married   they're having the bachelor party and the bridal 
shower the same day so it's conceivable that   while she's getting lingerie he'll be at a nude 
bar watching a table dancer in the same outfit that is possible but to me the difference between 
being single and being married is the form of   government you see when you're single you are 
the dictator of your own life i have complete   power when i give the order to fall asleep on 
myself with the tv on the middle of the day   no one can overrule me when you're married 
you are part of a vast decision-making body   before anything gets done there are meetings 
committees have to study the situation   and this is if the marriage works i 
think that's what's so painful about   divorce you've been impeached 
you weren't even the president   to me the whole concept of fear of success 
is proof that we are definitely scraping the   bottom of the fear barrel you know we're gonna 
have to have aa type meetings for these people   hi my name is bill and the one thing i'm worried 
about is having a stereo and a cream-colored couch   according to most studies people's number one 
fear is public speaking number two is death death   is number two now this means to the average person 
if you have to go to a funeral you're better off   in the casket than doing the eulogy how about that 
seedless watermelon what an invention scientists   are working on this i mean other scientists 
devote their lives to fighting cancer aids   heart disease these as you know i'm focusing 
on melon oh sure thousands of people are dying   needlessly but this that's gotta stop try and pick 
a wet one up off the floor it's almost impossible   i'm devoting my life to that so i guess if they 
can get rid of the seeds the rind is going next   what do we need that for get rid of the rind 
they're not going to stop until they're making   in the ground ready to eat fruit cups growing 
right out of the ground there's no way that moving   in with your parents is a sign that your life is 
right on track there's no way that you could fake   this even yeah things are going great i've been 
a terrific girl i got a great job making a lot   of money and if everything goes according to plan 
i'm gonna be moving back in with my parents soon it's like getting busted on a parole violation and 
thrown back into the slammer in the opinion of the   board you'd need further rehabilitation i'm afraid 
and you know you go back into that little room   of yours you feel so huge it's like you could 
take your bed and just crush it in your hands   you can hold your parents between your fingers 
and going why were they so afraid of you people   when i was growing up i never get enough sleep 
i stay up late at night because i'm night guy   night guy wants to stay up late what about 
getting up after five hours late oh that's   morning guys bro that's not my problem i'm 
night guard i stay up as late as i want   so you get up in the morning you're warm you're 
exhausted groggy oh i hate that night guy   see night guy always screws morning 
gun there's nothing morning guy can do   the only morning guy can do is try and oversleep 
often enough so that day guy loses his job   and night guy has no money to go out anymore to 
me government is basically parents for adults   especially the irs the irs is like ward and june 
cleveland and we're all wally and the beaver and   your accountant is eddie haskell showing you 
all these neat tricks to get away with stuff   which is fine unless you get audited then 
you don't want some wise guy in the suit   just standing there going you have a very 
lovely office here sir because jail is the   government's way of sending you to your room 
and when you meet whitey and lumpy in the joint there's really going to be 
something wrong with the bathroom   if you look at a hospital the basic treatment 
everybody gets is to lie in a bed whatever is   wrong with human being lie down doctor never 
says to you well your condition isn't as bad   as we originally thought we want you to kind of 
lean against the door jam for seven to ten days   see how that feels all right it's always 
a bed unless you go to the emergency room   then it's a chair you've been shot you can stag 
you can run over have a seat there's always a   very uh interesting cultural ethnic mix of the 
hospital staff isn't it it's like a local news   team in there the doctor's like the anchorman 
he's got the white hair he's in charge the nurse   is like the feature reporter you know you listen 
to her but it's always a now back to your doctor   when the orleans come in with the food and the 
bedpans and that's like your sports and weather   professional tennis to me i don't understand all 
the shushing why are they always just shh don't   the players know that we're there so we duck down 
behind the seat so they don't see us watching them   to me tennis is basically just ping pong 
and the players are standing on the table   that's all it is and that goofy scoring you 
win one point all of a sudden you're up by 15.   two points 30 love 30 love sounds like 
an english call girl that'll be 30 love and could you be a little quieter next time please   die glasses when i was 10 years old anybody beat 
that anybody got them younger than that seven two born with glasses actually come out of the birth canal and go 
that was a hell of a delivery i'll tell you that   can i clean these stuff does anybody have one 
of those old snails i just i was just born the old-fashioned barbershop is unfortunately 
becoming a thing of the past now what went wrong   well first of all it is a twenty thousand dollar 
chair to make a three dollar tip i say cut back   on the chair update the magazines why do barbers 
always display that license there's no laws in   hair cutting except show every customer the back 
of their head that's the one law i don't want   to see the back of my head why do i want to see 
something that i'm never going to see at any other   time when i buy pants two salesmen don't lift me 
up by the legs and go how do you like the crotch   if i wanted to see everything 
i would have been a fly   if there's a serial killer loose in your 
neighborhood it seems like the safest thing   is to be the neighbor they never killed a neighbor 
the neighbor always survives to do the interview   afterwards right uh he was kind of quiet i 
love these neighbors they're never disturbed   by the sounds of murdering just stereo chainsaws 
people screaming fine just keep the music down   when i'd always fall in love with the 
serial killer they write to him in prison   here's a woman that's hard to disappoint i guess 
she's only upset when she finds out he stopped   killing people and she goes you know sometimes i 
feel like i don't even know who you are anymore you can always tell what was the best year 
of your father's life because they seem to   freeze that clothing style and just ride 
it out to the end don't they and it's not   like they don't continue shopping it's just 
they somehow managed to find new old clothes   every father is like this fashion time capsule 
you know what i mean it's like they should be on a   pedestal with someone next to them going this was 
1965. to me the worst thing is shopping for pants   i hate dressing and undressing in that little room 
what men need is a place to shop where you go in   you check your pants at the door you just walk 
around the store in your underwear that would be   the best way then you'd really have to lie to the 
salesman need some help no just getting some air   you know doctors supposed to be such a 
prestigious occupation but it's really   like one of the only jobs where you have to have 
your diploma right up there on the wall it makes   him seem so insecure doesn't it i really am a 
doctor you know you think i'm not just check it   i don't know out they need these little bits 
of psychological leverage over us all the time   go in that little room take your pants 
off wait 15 minutes and i'll give you my   penny and after that anybody that comes 
with pants on seems like they know what   they're talking about any difference 
of opinion pants always beats no pants whale's supposed to be such an intelligent 
uh animal you know you always hear about how   they can communicate by song from miles away 
how extensive their vocabulary is i would say   from the rate we are pushing the whales 
off the beach back into the ocean the words   shore and close do not appear to be in their 
vocabulary i would say the whales concentrate a   little less on the singing a little more on the 
approaching cuervo beach volleyball tournament   you want to maintain that brainy mammal 
image it is my opinion that we never should   have landed a man on the moon it's a mistake now 
everything is compared to that one accomplishment   there we go i can't believe they could 
land a man on the moon and taste my coffee   i think we all would have been a lot happier if 
we hadn't landed a man on the moon then we go   they can't make a prescription bottle top that's 
easy to open i'm not surprised i couldn't land   a man on the moon things make perfect sense to 
me now neil armstrong should have said that's   one small step for man one giant leap for every 
wine and complaining sob on the face of the earth   i love these nature shows i'll watch any kind 
of nature show and it's amazing how you can   always relate to whatever they're talking about 
you know like you're watching the african dung   beetle and you're going but his life is a lot 
like mine and you always root for whichever   animal is the star of the show that week like 
give us the antelope and there's a lion chasing   the ants let me run handle up run use your 
speed get away right then next week it's the   lion and then let me go get the antelope eat him 
bite his ass trap him don't let him use his beam   mannequin's kind of an insult to your imagination 
you couldn't possibly visualize a sweater   so we'll show you on this life-size snotty 
puppet i guess when they're finished with them   they become crash test dummies that's the end of 
the line for a mannequin whatever happened to bob   have you seen that new volvo commercial he's got a 
bull's eye right in his face panties are only used   for car accidents and fashion i guess these are 
the two situations that it's impossible for us to   imagine ourselves well dressed or getting killed 
i'm sure some pro-mannequin organization doesn't   even like you to use the term mannequin hey 
they're not mannequins they're the life deprived   the bus is the single stupidest fattest slowest 
most despised vehicle on the road isn't it you   know when you get behind the bus people in 
your car go what are you doing get away come   on the back of the bus it's like an eclipse 
isn't it people are just like the sun where's   the sun it's like this huge metal ass just 
taking up the whole windshield of your car   when it pulls out it even sounds like 
a fat uncle trying to get out of a sofa i think of all the places that you go all 
the time the dry-cleaning relationship is   one of the most bizarre because you 
keep giving each other the same thing   back and forth over and over again he gives it 
to you you give it to him he gives it back to you   it's like it's half his shirt and way he has 
it as much as you do you want to go shopping   with him what do you think of this shirt 
that would look good with a light start the only warning label people 
really respect is dry clean only   you know what i mean speed limits lung cancer 
cigarette warnings your very life is at stake   with it but dry clean only oh the dope with that 
in the wash it's dry clean only are you crazy   i really feel as human beings we need more 
training in our basic social skills conversational   distance don't you hate these people that talk to 
you they talk into your mouth like you're a clown   at a drive-through and hand shakes is the worst 
there's absolutely no guidelines for handshakes   you don't have people too strong too weak 
sometimes they give you the three-quarter   handshake just the fingers early release 
late release sometimes people will dispute   your release you let go they are hanging on i have 
actually said to people hey the handshake is over   too many pumps coming in too 
high too sweaty from too far away   sometimes a guy will give you a strong 
grip late release and pull you in for   the too close conversation to him i 
say that's three strikes you're out   doing the thing about birthday parties is that 
the first birthday party you have and the last   birthday party you have are actually quite similar 
you know you just kind of sit there you're the   least excited person at the party you don't even 
really realize that there is a party you don't   know what's going on both birthday parties people 
kind of have to help you blow out the candles you   can't do it you don't even know why you're doing 
it what is this ritual what is going on it's also   the only two birthday parties where other people 
have to gather your friends together for you   sometimes they're not even your friends they make 
the judgment they bring them in they sit them down   and they tell you these are your friends tell 
them thank you for coming to my birthday party   i find a human fascination with water is 
amazing we're constantly going to beaches pools   lakes rivers we're swimming we're snorkeling we're 
we're scuba diving we bathe in it our bodies are   mostly made of water everyone's carrying around 
these bottles of water we can't get enough water   unless it rains then we're like oh look i'm soaked i am literally drenched for 
some reason we have a huge   problem with small flying water it'll just 
stop us right in our tracks oh i felt a drop we're gonna get caught in it let me cover it seems pretty hard to justify at this 
point in human history the existence of   men and their handkerchiefs i mean they 
open it up blow their nose in it and then   put it back in their pocket with their other 
valuables wild keys mucus yup got everything is it because men can't give birth or they're 
just proud of anything that comes out of us well actually have a monogram son 
andre what is the source of pride here   you actually have it sticking up out of a 
breast pocket of our jacket i have a snot rag i've always wondered why baseball is so associated 
with sex he's playing the field who we scored he   didn't get to first base i struck out why 
she wanted a diamond it's always baseball   always baseball as far as baseball goes i prefer 
the fat umpires i feel if you're on the field   you're not in the game you should be in the worst 
physical condition a human being could possibly be   they should be allowed to eat during the game we're a little too into sports in this 
country i think we got to throttle back   you know what i mean people come home from 
these games we won we want no they won you watch i find it fascinating uh when you go in the 
stationery store that they're manufacturing   millions of pens constantly we're all buying 
them i must have bought six thousand bits in   my life i've used up maybe two of them 
where is the rest of them when you move   your refrigerator there's always a couple 
back there but that doesn't account for it   where are all the pens that's why it's 
so embarrassing if you don't have one   you gotta borrow and we always have 
to wish burgers it's so humiliating   i don't have a pen you're making millions 
of them every week i know where are they there's something very sincere about these 
greeting cards that we send back and forth to each   other all the time they're like these little one 
dollar folded paper emotional prostitutes isn't it   i don't know what my feelings are so 
i'll just pay some total stranger a buck   to make up this little hallmark hooker to do the 
job for me so i can go uh here i didn't write this   but uh whatever they wrote uh i think the same 
thing would it be better if we just had one card   that covered every occasion for everybody in 
one shot just happy birthday merry christmas   happy anniversary congratulations it's a boy and 
our deeper sympathies signed the whole office   i think the thing i admire most about 
the chinese is that they're hanging in   there with the chopsticks because if you think 
about it you know they've seen the fork by now   i'm sure they've seen the spoon they're going 
yeah they're okay we're gonna stay with the sticks   i mean i don't know how i missed it thousands 
of years ago chinese farmer gets up as his   breakfast with the chopstick goes out and 
works all day in the field with a shovel   hello shovel not going out there plowing 
40 acres with a couple of pool cubes loveseat is an interesting little item there i 
guess some guy thought well if we can't get him   to sit closer to us why not just shorten the 
furniture my other favorite furniture brand is   the lazy boy this is very flattering to the 
prospective customer isn't it why don't we   just call it the half conscious deadbeat with no 
job home all day eating cheetos and watching tv   reclining i mean it goes back so far that thing 
i mean go to bed already it's over your wife i've never been able to figure out why 
they make these bizarre toilet seats   that they have you know like those clear 
lucite ones with all the the coins in it   it's a lovely tribute to our 
past president by the way   it's not bad enough lincoln got shot in the head 
we got to pull down our pants and sit on it too   it's just incomprehensible that you would buy a 
thing like this you install it on your toilet seat   and this says what about you well i can't afford 
to just throw money down the toilet but look how   close i am you have a close friend and they get 
involved with someone in a relationship it affects   your friendship doesn't it because like you're 
a comedy team and now there's this third person   you know what kind of throws off the timing who's 
on first i don't know uh dear who who do you think   is on first in fact whenever a friend of mine 
starts with a new girlfriend he should just say   i look like the person you used to know but i've 
been modified to survive in this relationship   in other words if we're having an argument and 
she's there i may say i totally disagree with you   but what that means is i'd like to help you 
out but i'd rather continue to see her naked   car names are so stupid aren't they 
no baron has ever owned a lebaron   or the ford ltd ltd limited it's limited 
edition what do they make 50 million of those   yes it's limited to the number we can sell 
or when they try and mangle a positive word   into a car name you know how they'll do 
that the integra oh integrity no integra   the supra or the impreza well i hope it's not 
a lemona or you'll be hearing from my lawyer I don't even know what what is 
supposed to be so attractive   about her why does a man want to see a woman 
infer men want women to shave their legs shave   their armpits block their eyebrows and then 
before we go out we dress them up like a bear   to me the only reason to wear fur would be if you 
were trying to sneak up on another animal you ever see   those tribal hunters where they wear the fur and 
then they have the other animal's head on top   of their head you know i'm sure there's a moose 
looking at that going yeah that looks real good   yeah i'm gonna turn my back on this goofball with 
the extra head because there's nothing fishy going   on there i'll just keep drinking from the stream 
i've seen a lot of two-headed tigers with knees The Christmas tree certainly 
seems to inspire a love-hate   relationship all that time is spent 
selecting it and decorating it   and then a week after it's just thrown 
somewhere you see it by the side of the road   looks like a mob hit the car slows down the door 
opens and this tree just rolls out the bumper people snap out of that christmas spirit 
like it was a drunken scooper they just   wake up one morning and go oh my god there's 
a tree inside the house just throw it anywhere tennis is the only sport where the uniform is what 
you would wear under your clothes in any other   sport you're actually out there in your underwear 
unless in the old days you know they would wear   those long pants and the big heavy sweaters how 
long would it take them to get over that we're   out here in the hot sun running around after 
a ball what exactly are we all dressed up for   maybe that's why they started keeping score like 
that point you know what make it 15. i'm dying in   this sweater here another one got behind me take 
another 10 points let's just get this all the way   loyalty to any one sports team is pretty 
hard to justify because the players are   always changing the team can move to another 
city you're actually rooting for the clothes   when you get right down to it you know i mean 
you are standing and cheering and yelling for   your clothes to beat the clothes from another city 
fans will be so in love with the player but if he   goes to another team they boom this is the same 
human being in a different shirt they hate him now different shirts the big new accessory with 
eyeglasses uh seems to be that strap that   connects in the back so you can take 
them on and off which i don't get because   i thought if you have glasses isn't that because 
you need to wear glasses you need glasses isn't   that what they say i mean an eye doctor doesn't 
say would you care for some glasses when people   have crutches they don't have like a little chain 
attached to their belt so they could just let go   of them every now and then why not get a toupee 
with a rubber band for when you water skiing the whole concept of the wanted poster 
has got to be the most wildly optimistic   crime fighting idea i mean so how does it 
work okay i'm online at the post office   i see the guy i see the list of offenses 
i check the guy standing in line behind me   if it's not him that's pretty much all i can 
do okay it's not that i don't want to help   you know the annoying thing is i think why 
didn't they hold on to this guy when they're   taking his picture no we don't do it that 
way we take the picture and we let him go   until we get the front and side shut 
front is his face the side is him leaving now i was thinking the other day about hair and 
that the weird thing about it is that people will   touch other people's hair you will actually kiss 
another human being right on the head but if one   of those hairs should somehow be able to get 
out of that skull and go off on its own it is   now the vilest most disgusting thing that you 
can encounter the same hair people freak out remember a few years ago in new york we 
had the doorman strike they have a union   in the fancy buildings and they went out on strike 
now you would think if any group of people would   not want to demonstrate what life would be 
like without them it would be dormant let's   see how they do without us there's no doorman 
people open the door they walk in this you know   who's gonna walk out next you know 
the guys that clean your windshield   at the traffic light with the dirty rag 
we demand shorter yellows and longer reds   buying shoes is one of the great shopping 
challenges has ever seen someone put on a   new pair of shoes they turn into a zombie as 
soon as they start walking around the store yeah these are pretty good then they have that little one foot high 
mirror there what is that about so i can   see what cats will think of my shoes what 
is that angle bum passed out on the curb   hey what do you think of these i just got 
them i've seen them from that angle myself you know these pest control companies they 
call themselves exterminators but they can't   really do it the best they can do is get 
the bugs to go to somebody else's house   they just relocate them you know what i 
mean they're bug realtors is what they are   uh i think you'll be happy here 
there's a lot of crumbs not much light   they usually sleep through the night so you'll 
really have your run in the place most of the time   nobody really cares about killing insects 
even the animal rights people don't care   you could probably walk into an animal rights 
organization meeting and hear a speech like   the only way to stop the cruelty of the scientific 
testing on animals is to boycott these companies   the worst part about a car breaking down 
is when you're out on the road you're a guy   because now you have to get out and 
pretend like you know what you're doing i'm going to go check it out walk 
around the front open up the hood   that's good because it obscures her view 
that's the main reason you want to do that   you're looking in there you know you're hoping 
you're going to see something in there so simple   so obvious so incredibly easy to fix even you can 
handle it like a giant on off switch turned off how about the little scam the airlines have going 
now with these uh special clubs 150 a year to sit   in the room eat peanuts drink coffee and soda and 
read magazines excuse me isn't this the flight   i already got four hours of this coming to 
me what am i paying for how about it i got   all my luggage club can i get into that where 
is that from i would like to join that club airlines love to divide us up into classes 
you know like when you're sitting in coach   they always have the students always 
closes that stupid curtain you know   they always give you that little look like 
maybe if you had worked a little harder monkeys are really the end of the line 
in the pet world i think when you're at   the monkey level of pet ownership i have a 
kid i mean come on i mean you're so close   if you need a pet that can roller skate and 
smoke cigars it's time to think about a family monkeys of course were the first astronauts in 
the 60s which i'm sure made perfect sense in   the monkey brain i feel that is the next logical 
step for me because i've been working with the   italian guy in the crank organs and i think i'm 
ready to handle the maximum re-entry geforces   i've never been any place in my life where there 
was absolutely no coffee and people are constantly   trying to give you coffee who's having coffee 
was like sometimes i'm gonna give you something coffee is one of the only things you can have 
that people continue to try and give it to you   wages are always coming over can i fill 
it up can i warm it up can i top it off   it's like you can lift up a manhole cover we 
just made a fresh pod would you like something this liquid is taking over humanity there 
are coffee machines we have to call mister coffee anyone hey that's mr coffee to you see like every morning when you wake up 
it's like you're being born all over again   you ever have that feeling because you can't 
see you can't talk you're on your way to the   bathroom you're trying to remember how do i 
walk i mean it's like you've never been alive   before but if any invention marks the decline 
of human civilization i think would have to be   the snooze alone the smooth alarm is based on 
the idea that when the alarm goes off you are   not getting up and you're not even awake you're 
already a failure they should sell the snooze   alarm with an unemployment application a bottle of 
tequila just make it a complete pathetic loser kit i always feel bad for the silver medal winner 
in the olympics i mean how do you live with that   the rest of your life people are going to keep 
asking how much did you lose by i don't even know i trained i worked out i exercised i did 
everything i was doing push-up sit-ups i   never did anything but exercise and workout 
for 20 years i flew away around the world that was it was a photo finish silver 
gold if i had a pimple i would have won   yes i'm very lazy eater and that's why i like 
soup first of all it looks half digested when   they put it down in front of you so so you feel 
like half the work is done already i'm hoping   campbell's comes out with like an iv line of soup 
so you could just jam right into your arm you know   campbell's tomato intravenous mainline gumbo   everyone just sitting around at dinner with their 
soup iv just hanging on the hook there you know how's yours grandpa? Oh chunky stuff. i really guys trying to use that cash 
machine now don't they we're just   like chickens in an experiment waiting 
for that pellet to come down the shoe   you see people with the cash 
machine they're just there waiting for the sound you know the sound you're 
waiting for the sound that's what we're trained   to hear the here comes the money sound you 
know it's exciting don't you get excited   it's coming it's coming i'd like to know when tic-tac-toe became 
the pound sign that's what i'd like to know   why they call it what it really is leave you a 
numeric message now and then press archie's head   and what does that redial but let's face it you're 
either going to get the person the machine or they   have call waiting who is redialing and redialing 
this is like the harassment key for people in   a fight you know hey i'm not through you can't 
do that to me and another thing can be so vain   don't you know i have a friend wears eyeglasses no 
prescription in the glasses because he thinks it   makes him look more intelligent now why why do we 
think that glasses makes us look more intelligent   is it from the endless hours of reading and 
studying and researching that this person   supposedly blew out their eyeballs 
and that's why they need the glasses   it's just a corrective device if you see 
someone with a hearing aid you don't think   oh they must have been listening real good yeah 
to a lot of important stuff no they are death   they can't hear i think gum is one of the 
weirdest human inventions it's not liquid   it's not solid it's not a food what is it it 
isn't really anything you know i mean it's like   a stationary bike for your job remember when you 
were in school and teachers would get all riled up   if they caught you with gum when you were a kid 
you there was a big deal but as an adult i can   understand it because when you're chewing gum 
you don't look like you're too thrilled with   anything anybody has to say oh world war ii that 
was an important historical event yeah i'm sure   they landed a man on the moon 1969 yeah right yeah i buy that teacher i don't know why people are surprised when someone 
gets hit in the head with a golf ball if you ever   watch these tournaments on tv you got 600 people 
crowding around a hole that big and no one can   believe it when a titleist gets bounced off of 
someone's coconut you know you throw a rock into   a crowd that's considered terrorism but if you 
have a nice follow-through you know let's go   i'm always impressed actually with the golf 
camera man whose job it is to follow the golf   ball when it's in the sky you know it makes a 
little white ball it's doing 100 miles an hour   on a white background i got it off so i got it 
so i got it i lost it why bother aim the camera   at the sky aiming at the ground take a ball out of 
your pocket throw it down who's gonna know where   the hell it came from i love it when people 
are complimented on something they're wearing   and they accept the compliment as if it was about 
them nice tie well thank you thank you very much   if the compliment is for the tie it's not for you 
but we take it and that's kind of job of clothes   to get compliments for us because it's very hard 
to get compliments based on your human quality   right let's face it no matter how nice 
a person you are nobody's gonna come hey   nice person it's much easier to be a 
bastard and just try and match the colors up oh people in florida they drive slow and 
they sit low right that is their motto   the state flag of florida should be like a 
steering wheel with a hat and two knuckles on it and that left turn signal on from 
when they left the house that morning   right that's a legal turn in florida it's 
known as an eventual left and all people   get to a certain age where when they back out of 
the driveway they don't look you know what i mean   they just feel like well i'm old and i'm 
coming back i survived let's see if you can   you get to a certain point with your parents 
where really the only thing you can do with them   is eat you can't talk anymore but you want 
to at least try and keep your mouths moving   and they're so anxious for it you know you 
come in how was the plane you must be hungry   how did you sleep are you ready for 
breakfast my mother will argue with me   about what i like can i have a piece of pumpkin 
pie you don't like pumpkin pie yes i do since   when what's the difference can i have it no i 
have never seen you eat a piece of pumpkin pie then the pilot always comes on with his 
little announcements i'm going over this   i'm going over that i'm taking a left 
i'm bringing it up i'm taking it down   i'm going right i'm going this way i'm going 
that way and we're back then yeah that's all fine   just do whatever the hell you got to do 
i don't know what the hell is going on   do i bother him do i go knocking on the 
cockpit door i'm having the peanuts now   just thought you might like 
to know what we're doing the other thing i love is when you're in 
the middle of a dream and your alarm goes   off you incorporate the sound of the alarm 
into the dream so you can keep sleeping   and you'll make any adjustment in the dream to 
do it i was with marie antoinette in a dream   last night and she was on the guillotine the 
blade came down her head fell into the basket   it rolled over and she started 
singing neil diamond solitary men and i thought that is not my alarm 
going off this is actually happening   i was thinking about the wig historically i 
guess the revolutionary war was the last war   fought in wigs and it seems like that must 
have been hard you know they're going into   battle you think well do i have my bullets do i 
have my bobby pins now you got to make sure you   have everything a lot more to worry about 
what if i get killed is my wig on straight   i don't know when the whole wig thing came into 
style for a minute but i know when it went out   when the mirror was invented the guy is 
looking in a mirror powdering a thatch   of horse hair on his head going 
alright let's go wrap to the lady have you noticed that every little place you 
go into lately has that tip jar on the counter   what is the service that this tip is for anyway i 
mean isn't the man basically just turning around   isn't that really all it is i think we're 
tipping people now just for the absence of   outright hostility thanks very much and 
here's a little something extra for not   taking my head and smashing my face through 
the glass countertop really good service here let me get your car back from the car place and 
it's got that paper mat on the floor like they're   so obsessed with cleanliness i don't even want 
their shoes to touch the carpet meanwhile the   mechanic comes out he looks like al jolson he's 
covered in goo from head to toe you can't even   see him although i prefer that to when they have 
the lab coat the clipboard the nice glasses now   you know you're getting screwed can i see it 
you better not it's idling quietly right now   i think it should stay overnight we want to keep 
an eye on it we want to keep the bill running up the whole concept being separated to 
me is strange it's like you're engaged   to be divorced we're gonna try 
and make knocking together work   first we were separated then we met and then 
we were together now we're gonna try being   separated again we think actually some sort of 
giant rubber band might be the best solution   of course when you were a kid in school 
you get separated for having too good a ton   if you two kids don't stop laughing and 
having fun i'm gonna have to separate you   and the kid finds out his parents 
are breaking up and he thinks it's   because they got caught fooling 
around which is probably true i think if the wedding invitations were left 
up to the men we'd just drive around sticking   flyers and windshields you know not even typed 
up either just magic markers xerox you know arty what's needed is a divorce announcement 
mr mrs fred johnson uh question of your   presence at the returning of their 
daughter back to mr mrs fred johnson   it seems like whenever these uh office people 
call you in for a meeting the whole thing is about   the sitting down i would really like to sit 
down with you i think we need to sit down and   talk why don't you come in and we'll sit down 
because sometimes sitting down doesn't work   people get mad at the sitting you know we've been 
sitting here for i don't know how long how much   longer we just gonna sit here i'll tell you what i 
think we should do i think we should all sleep on   maybe we're not getting down low enough maybe 
if we all lie down then our brains will work you"
Jerry Seinfeld,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea2AcOKjsAg, i am karl reiner and i'm sick of people sitting at home and flipping around their channels first this important word  with their little remote control see i've seen the show that we're about to see now and i know the work that went into it and i know how brilliant it is and it would make me sick if you flipped those channels while the show was on so i'm going to have to ask you to please give me your remote controls i'm going to have to ask you to confiscate them please may i have your remote controls   i don't believe that this is all of them so those of you who are holding out we're going to render them useless they won't work so don't try it well you're in for a treat ladies and gentlemen mr jerry seinfeld  thank you good night it sounded like the end didn't it all right well look at this look at your lives this is your life you're right in the middle of it right now you're not home that's about it so far that's all you've accomplished but that's a pretty big thing isn't it to be not home except for those of you out there on tv you haven't even accomplished that you just paid your cable bill that's all you accomplished there's not much i can do about that and i think that's the most important thing about these shows you go to a show you're just not home that's it you want to go out isn't that the feeling how many times do you feel that you feel that you know that i gotta get out right i gotta get out and you go out you stand around somewhere for a little while and you go i got to be getting back i've been out i've got to get back i've got to go to sleep i've got to get up i've got to go out again tomorrow that is the feeling in life you've got to go all the time you get to your job what is your first thought i want to get home but you get home you feel cooped up you got to get out you're out of sight you got to get back wherever you are you've got to get the hell out of you gotta go all your life gotta go how many times a week do you say people gotta go i gotta go you gotta go let's go would you let me go i've gotta go we don't even ask each other where can you say gotta go go ahead okay i don't care what happened to that guy i don't know we had to go he said that he had to go he's going to go into the movies tonight i'm sure many of you considered that option could have gone away especially selected theater you could have gone to a theater near you i don't even know how these theaters know where i am  getting tired of getting ripped off on the candy are you you know we're getting killed on that candy especially when you see it in the glass case the jewelry case for candy i go up to the guy i'd like to see something in a milk dud if i could sometimes the guy will take out one milk dud put it on the black velvet display panel boy that's a beauty honey what do you think that's a two two-carat dude take a look at that and who is buying that horse bucket size of popcorn i don't need that much roofing insulation you know it comes with ear hooks you can put it on wear like a feed bag if you want come on let's go hello i'm jerry seinfeld how do comedians come up with material for years comedians have jealously guarded the secret of where material comes from it's been confidential until now the fact is almost everything is funny you just have to have a way of looking at it these are comedy x-ray specs they already know designed so that for the first time in history the general public will be exposed to the way comedians view our world for the next hour it will be as if you the viewer have stolen a comedian's brain how can this be i'll demonstrate let's just say we put the comedy x-ray specs right on the lens of the camera see that funny huh i think that's enough i said that's enough i'm glad you all enjoyed that now can we get on with this i'm from long island that's where i grew up thank you thank you that is the correct amount of applause i grew up there my folks just moved to florida this past year they didn't want to move to florida but they're in their 60s and that's the law they have those leisure police golf carts that pull up in front of your house now all around the country all right pop get the golf clubs get in the back let's go just drop the snow shovel right there pup i don't want any trouble moms i love my mom let me just say that but she's into things which is great she's into things she's into wallpaper she thinks wallpaper is absolutely riveting she every time i see her she pulls a little swatch out of her pocketbook what do you think about the whole house and this every room floor ceiling this pattern what do you think hey wait i'll put it up against the wall maybe you can imagine it better now what do you think do you think this or maybe or this one's better this one's better i thought this one was better whatever you think mom whatever you think but i try and get involved i want to you know i want to be involved i go to the wallpaper store i try and you know talk with the salesman or something there and what is the difference say between the semi-gloss paint and throwing myself off a building what would be the difference there you realize how dull you are to talk with has anyone ever told you that and what happens is i walk around the wallpaper store and you know when you get bored your feet just kind of start to drag and you just mom can we get out of here already please can we go they don't have it they don't um come on let's go they don't have them the guy talked to the other guy no no i don't think they're in the back i don't even think they have a back here let's just get out of here all right really i'm fading mom please just give me help me of course when you're a little kid and you get boys you can't support your body weight at all you have to really just lie down wherever you are when you're five and you get into one of these situations just lie down and wait it out that's what i would always support your parents they take you to the bank that was the classic one i mean their parents take me to the bank they turn around from the teller and i was just flat out on the floor just can't make it mom and they get so upset would you get up off the floor please get up i can't get up mom it's too dull in here you better get me one of my comic books i'm in a lot of trouble why do people come to the bank mom it's so dull in here and then she always tries to pick you up with that one arm but you just keep spinning around would you get up now but this is ridiculous you aren't embarrassing me do you realize that i wish i could help you mom i really do it's just too dark i really feel that that's one of the big powers of adulthood is the ability to be totally bored and remain standing i think that's why they can set up the dmv that way it's just the only exciting thing i ever remember when my parents would drag me along in these little errand things is when they would sometimes in front of a store they would have like the two red metal horses do you remember those and i would get so excited because that was something for kids mom they got them here mom come back they got them right here a dime one dime i can't remember what i can't remember is what is the fun of those rides what was the fun to vibrate for a minute and a half is that anxious just sit down there and go you get off i feel a thousand percent better mom thank you very much i feel totally refreshed and revitalized in fact i'm ready for the wallpaper store now you want to go back there lamps furniture i'm into it let's roll because that's what happens with parents what happens actually is that the roles begin to reverse with you and your parents you know that moment i don't know when it happens there's just that moment that all of a sudden you're in the mall and you're in charge and they wander all around the store like little ducklings you know that moment all of a sudden you're running around mom we lost dad he's down by the uh tools dad mom is going to be over there do you want to get it together or should we do you want to meet later and they're just quack

are you gonna do you just saw some of my material now let's try it with the specs and i'll show you why it seemed funny to me in the first place why do we have to get here late every year yeah you're sure you're betting here you know they're putting in there well that's good for you how do they do that well it's it's in the mix why can't you get the directions every year i've never had one meal here i think i was invisible to them you don't write anything down i play candy land i put on fire you know i believe i'm losing weight i'm swimming that's the way the world is you can't win no you can't what'd you think what time supper normally i could barely take these scenes but i didn't mind today the tickets to my all-time favorite tv show had finally arrived the howdy duty show i was going to the peanut gallery a dream come true twenty thousand dollars of plastic surgery they say i'm still not done yet i've always felt that it takes time what are you gonna do it's yeah time will honey hand me my cigarette no not yeah i heard murray's in the hospital you heard anything i don't like him very bad he should drop dead oh you should drop books they should all drop time for all seasons who's got the time i wish i had the time now it says here they're taking howdy duty out there  oh yeah they're taking hearty duty off the air i'm not surprised he looks very good i don't even know what off the air come here you goofy kid your undies all in a bundle over a puppet come over here now now you listen to your uncle lou all right i was in the same situation myself the other day on the phone to one of my main suppliers jack kramel from american attention envelopes the client right there in my office nothing to deal with my problem you know what i did i lied i always lie lied right in his face bald face lie right in front of the client it didn't bother me i always lie see that's how i get started in business i can be lying to you right now not even though you're just a kid it was different when i was a young man we had to be men at that time anyway i had to walk to school was uphill both ways it's like an escher print figure that out but i'll tell you one thing hey hey hey wait a minute hey why don't you tell me you were there i would huh yeah tell him i'm buffalo bob i'll vouch for you hey i'm a lot older than you are and i don't know if i ever told the truth once

person who says that my friends family i'll tell you one thing though yeah i love what she's done with them oh it's beautiful hey there's a whole other room in there it's again just like me and he looks very bad sure so that's why i never liked family gatherings because that's what all of that serves to explain why i don't know i had a lot of good tourists but the best toy was always something you can get on your own like a cardboard box if you're five years old you get one of those big boxes comes in from the refrigerator when you fire that's the closer you're gonna come to having your own apartment you crawl in you cut a little hole for the window mom dad you must come over sometime really i'm so convenient to where you live it's the fridge today building apartment one the entrance is right around the front i played with toys had a yo-yo which was interesting i don't know if you know the yo-yo was originally a weapon invented in the philippines i'm not making that up they really did i don't know how they used it as a weapon i think that's kind of interesting though that nations warring with yo-yos i don't know how they accomplished that planes flying low over enemy villages they lean out the door hey i think i got the chief enemy tribes on the ground you know that really hurt why are they doing this yo-yo crime in the city all right buddy up against the wall i got a dunkin butterfly in my pocket one false move i rocked the baby right here  don't make me go around the world speaking of armies the swiss have an interesting army 500 years without a war pretty impressive also pretty lucky for them you ever see that little swiss army knife they have to fight with not much of a weapon there corkscrews bottle openers come on buddy let's go you get past me the guy in back of me he's got a spoon back off pal i got the toe clippers right here i'll clip that pinky toe down and up it i hope you're starting to see what a powerful tool these can be they can also adjust the world a little more to your personal taste let's take one more look at that living room and see how much fun it could have been if the atmosphere had been a little looser  rack them up dad that kid came in his fantasy living room come on dad you give it a try i just loaded it up with fresh clocks all right  try it with this hey get this hammer from my toolbox oh yeah and i'm gonna put it back wherever i want i've got no problem with that you know when i was a kid we used to play outside yeah yeah just go already all right i don't believe you two you know that's my favorite piece now that's enough playing around you guys go wash your hands the chocolate's almost ready for dinner oh and jerry please bring your frog to the table okay okay boy what a you're glad i don't have school this year come on dad let's go wash up i love that kid  fathers have you know very specific things that they like to do and one of their favorite things i think is to move heavy furniture you know they pretend that they hate this when they get the job when they hear that something very heavy has to be moved they pretend oh but they love it they do love it because they're in charge of this whole tremendously complex thing the father's love to say come on give me a hand with this you want to give me a hand something very very heavy give me a hand my father never moves a sofa unless he's got a cigarette in his mouth burned down or a quarter of an inch long the smoke goes right in the eye i don't know why this is how he likes to move things have you got your in there  i can't see anything because you want your eyes blinking and tearing when you're going backwards down a staircase holding a couch that's the easy way to do it isn't it that's his other big advice to me easy i don't know what the hell that means every time we lift up something heavy he goes easy now take it easy easy easy it's not easy it's very difficult okay you want easy leave it here in the hallway that's easy if we're going to move it it's very difficult why don't you say what you mean when you pick it up just go difficult difficult it's very difficult this is very difficult this really hurts and it's difficult and i don't like doing this it's impossible put it down impossible impossible impossible you can't move that other part that gets me is the head fake when you've got the sofa in the air they wait until you've got it up then they explain the complex maneuver up the stair and around through the doorway right it's like all right angle it up now bring it back the way you got it it's never going to go it's got to come back and then over and then around and then bring it up angle it in corkscrew then up and then back on an opposite obtuse angle more back to the other way put it down now wait a minute i'm not getting enough smoke in the eye hold it no no the cigarette is out i'm losing smoke here let me go start up the car i'll stare into the exhaust pipe for about 30 minutes i want to get that eyeball like a radish that's what i like i like to be completely blind and move heavy furniture that's what i really really like  furniture what else do dads like they like uh they like car trunks you ever try and help your father affect the trunk dad where does this go just set it down right there it goes in some special way that only i understand no one could help him aliens could come from other galaxies to help him he would go would you all just let me do this please i know what i'm doing here dad from another galaxy i think they know how to travel not with your mother they don't just get the rest of the stuff and let me handle it here the thermostat is another big dad area i don't think i touched a thermostat till i was about 28 years old actually he had me so freaked out about it just don't touch it don't touch it what the hell is it i was in a hotel room when i finally got up the guts to just move it a little bit the whole night i was afraid he was gonna burst in the door who touched the thermostat in here you know i set it there for a reason what is the secret reason of the theorist i waited my whole life to find out finally one day he did he sat me down he told me this whole story the sperm the egg intercourse i said dad who cares get to the part where the thermostat comes in fathers nobody seems to know what to do with these guys they wander around the house nobody really knows how to operate them wouldn't it be great if there was some sort of a guide yeah a guide to the family dad good morning class all right continuing now with the guide to the family dad you are responsible for these new dad terms they go on your dad term to kid meaning glossary your mother and i means i have a little job for you this will take hours of your valuable time you have to be careful with these  i'm gonna watch a little tv i'm gonna fall asleep in a chair i'm gonna look at the paper i'm gonna fall asleep in a chair all right now one of the most important things to know about dad ownership is dads feel they know enough about the world to start their own civilization that's what the family is to them the fathers think the hell with life i can invent my own people my own rules for fashion my own health and diet have you ever had your father stick a big jar of high test super cheap horse radish under your nose  and then he says this cleans the system out right down the line they believe in this roto-rooter probably the trickiest part of that ownership is gift giving does anyone have any suggestions yes how about one of those executive decision makers like the 8-ball fine and you know what you'll get for your birthday robitussin someone else yes monogram shirt honey i know it's his shirt he knows it's his shirt who else needs to know whose shirt it is someone else oh oh oh yes i know how about a tie out but get out i don't believe i stand up here and talk till i'm blue in the face and i have to deal you belong in intro to dads that's room 101 down the hall i'll be back oh i see we got the family trip simulator in today i believe tommy wyman practiced on it earlier if you'd like to give us a little demonstration  all tommy now first thing get that seat belt off you can't possibly annoy your sister strapped in like that you're in heavy traffic on a sunday afternoon it's hot you're antsy you're moving around oh nice move to the floor of the car and that teasing's paying off your sister's starting to cry that means good point he's looking in the rearview mirror nice move with the comic books did you see that he protected himself with the book you're almost in the bonus round if you can just move the radio off his favorite station oh he's had it with you crazy kids he's hanging over he'll have both hands free in five seconds get out of the car you're in serious trouble getting out of the car nice going good scores on agility and aggravation but saving this slinky was risky and could have jeopardized the entire mission i'm sorry to have to be so rough on you kids but remember a dad is not just a job it's an adventure dad salute dismissed those are very special kids pets dogs are uh pets dogs are the pets that really dogs want to be people do you ever feel that from your dog you walk by him he's just sitting there in the living room with that look on his face like he's thinking i could do that he's not that good look he tripped on the carpet edge over there and they get up there in the front seat of the car this is of course i think the ultimate dog experience to ride in the front seat of the car the human being did you ever take your dog out like that saturday afternoon sunday afternoon you've got nothing to do he's generally free he's not gonna go i did have the bone scheduled for today i uh i could push it into monday but that kind of backs me up with the rawhide chew toys but i can't really no i'm just all jammed up here so they get up in the front seat of the car i think the first thing they notice is that your head and his head are the same height and he thinks hey maybe no one will know i'm a dog just those two heads going down the street he watches the road what is he looking at why is he watching the road are you going to turn there i would turn there he sees his doggy friends don't bark at me now i'm with people don't ever park at me when i'm with people and they try they want so badly to fit in you know so they try to accommodate their body to the car seat you know they stand up they sit down they try this position you know or they send it whichever way you turn he's not ready no he's not ready for any kind of return you crank that wheel he drops right out of sight he's just he's gone he's just gone he just hey ho hey hey hey what happened take it easy over there i can't get a grip i've got no thumbs shake it out pal that's a poor baby three circles some of them kind of start to get good at that you know they kind of get that leaning those front pores are trembling terribly what is happening but then you get hungry you know and then you know you just kill it from because you get hungry you stop at some place you get a hamburger and a drive-through or something this just blows his mind instant food his life's goal he looks over too like how did you get that that's the greatest thing i've ever seen in my life dogs can't get one they can't get anything they have no money dogs are broke their entire lives you know why they have no money no pockets they have no pockets they see change on the street there's nothing they can do about it  remember the x-ray specs are fully automatic do not attempt to adjust your attitude towards more sympathetic or more cynical we will control why something is funny dogs do want to be people and they think they're going to be they all have their little human accessories they've all been taught human behaviors sit shake why does he have to learn to shake he's not closing any big business deals all right i'm gonna go in the store you wait here i'll be right back the window don't forget the window air dogs need air and open the window a little bit this code isn't van line you know  i could do this wouldn't hurt my social life any great meal i'm stuck kibble  so uh maybe you'd like to go for a walk later oh by the way  these are for you you know you smell fantastic are you wearing perfume no no  i guess i just love that smell so have you tried the new gravy tray oh no i'm still on cycle too i'm pretty active wow i try and keep in shape uh mostly walking i chase my tail when i get the chance oh here he comes you miss me fella yeah like the mange no biscuits boy if i could run this fast i'd be king of the dogs  you like the car don't you boy hey duke spot muffin it wasn't the vet i'm okay i'm each in the yard i like dogs i do but they're they're really not that bright either i mean let's examine the dog mind the way it works first of all every time you come home he thinks it's amazing he can't believe you've accomplished this again you walk in the door the joy of it almost kills him he's back again it's that guy it's that guy that was here before the same guy you're that guy they have the whole little celebration dance that they do you know but if you go out for five minutes and you come back he goes through the whole routine all over again you're back again i have no concept of time i'm uh i'm not married just hanging out gets a round of applause but it takes nothing to accomplish that really i was engaged one time being engaged is a pretty tense situation i don't know if you've been engaged the word engaged itself is a pretty tense word you're engaged it's like suddenly you're part of a gear you know  boy and uh but i didn't get married but that was you know being being engaged you know what it's like to me it's like being on the first part of the roller coaster where you're just going up tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick boy this looks pretty scary you got get to the top to give you the ring and a piece of cake and you go   your friends are on the ground going boy look at him go cut me another piece of cake here he comes again so i had to get out i wanted to get i didn't want to be married so what do you do what do you do there what do you do you just say no i can't be there in fact that whole week is bad for me i've got my fear of commitment classes that week my i don't want to grow up training seminars in there relationships are tough you ever ask someone about their relationship they just you just ask me about it so how's it going with judy it's very tough well even if it's going great they always touch their face that's what i noticed with people you know what you said asking brother how's it going it's going all right no it's good but how long you been going now a little while just tuesday night middle of the week not too much cologne we can tell what day of the week it is by the cologne content of the room i'm wearing cologne right now actually i don't even know why i don't even know cologne is everything about cologne i mean it's a pretty deceptive thing i mean am i hoping people will think i really smell like this or that i sweat brute somehow or something i got this whole gibson i'm really just trying to use it up i got cologne after shave soap on a rope that comes in handy a lot of times i'm in the shower i want to hang myself who thought of that hey people love soap they love rope let's put them together we can sell millions of these why because it rhymes i don't need shaving cream on a wooden bean my favorite is the underarm deodorant with the cologne smell that is the ultimate stub right you got the cologne face and neck but you feel you need the same smell shooting out from under the arms i think once the woman's got her face in your armpit the seduction is pretty much over i would say she likes you women have their things they have what do they have their cologne perfume toilet water there's another dynamite name for a product what the hell was going on at that meeting why don't we name it after the water in the toilet that is the most disgusting thing i've ever heard i think they'll like it then we can come out with a cesspool body splash yeah men and women we're different the bathrooms are certainly different men's bathrooms women's bathrooms women's bathrooms are kind of neat actually the public ones there you have a door says women on it women just keep coming out of it i like that right there men always said anywhere to meet women i say there you go there's a door what could be clearer than that it says women they got to be in there fans room on the other hand is a pretty nauseating disgusting place and every man in there is a sickening revolting human slime as far as i'm concerned you don't want to know anybody when you go in there you don't even want to use your hands you operate everything with the feet toilets faucets candles you become an orangutan they ought to put ropes in there so you could swing in pee swing out i think that would be fun  women's bathrooms at home are a whole another deal there when they're working in that bathroom don't attempt to get in there no it's like trying to get in to see the wizard of oz you know she's like no the woman behind the bathroom door silence who's there olsen i have your fertility bouquet oh it's you oh come on up i'll leave the door open i'm just finishing up in the bathroom hello  cats they always give me that just because you know her doesn't mean we

supermarket as an adult and get what i want and if i don't want something i put it back wherever i am in the supermarket too because i don't work for the supermarket i don't care if the store manager is looking right at me yeah those are my peaches on top of the pennzoil what about it it's impulse not buying my friend too many weird items in there too many thai detergent is improved have you seen this they are still working on time that blows me away they are still working untied somewhere people are working laboratories weeknights weekends pay me the file bill maybe if we sharpen the granules they'll get into the dirt more now they show you how detergents get out blood stains on television pretty violent image there i think if you've got a t-shirt with blood stains all over it maybe laundry isn't your biggest problem right now maybe you ought to get rid of the body before you do the walk oscar meyer is expanding his little area it's not little anymore is it oscar meyer is now a huge monstrous place that area that whole section there keeps getting bigger and it's and for him it's not easy to come up with new products you realize we're asking mine to come up with a new product he has to invent meat folks there is no olive loaf animal as far as i know i've never seen a pig with little pimentos in the south some of them i don't even think he knows what he came up with they gave him those vague you know oscar mayer names like lunch and meat we grabbed him we threw him in the package we never got a real good look at him we were in the woods it happened fast uh i had the ears frank had his legs he was trying to get away trying to wrestle him there and then he slipped out all we know is it's some kind of meat you should eat it around noon that's pretty much all we figured out tonight for that other one head cheese whoa  the guy who invented head cheese was hungry i think we know that i've always felt the words head and cheese should never be close together for any reason  it doesn't look like cheese i mean it can't be cheese it's got to be some kind of meat but they call it head cheese i guess because even oscar meyer knows nobody's gonna buy head meat i don't care what your background is you will steer clear of the head meat you'll get great nuts or something nobody really knows what the hell that is either the open the box no grapes no nuts what's the story there everyone wants to know what's in this that's the big thing in the supermarket's ingredients you see people in reading ingredients what's in it what's it ever seen may contain one or more of the following may contain what is that additive roulette what if it's important what if you have diabetes does it have sugar maybe we're not saying food as an adult i think is a great thing because you just pick whatever you want you know when you're a little kid when you're in the supermarket it's humiliating remember you have to beg for food in public from your own family they're so horrible mom please can have these i have the chocolate on the inside i'll eat them i promise i will okay i'll put it back all right i'm putting it back i'm putting it back now how about these are

box of cereal was a big deal the equivalent of landing a job for an adult my greatest kid dream was to someday actually get a job in that field i wasn't picky plate design crunch analysis or maybe the editor in chief of serial world magazine well then who is causing the contents to settle during shipping great caesars ghost hold on fresh team each morning can you hold please steve how far are you

subject of laundry first all right to me clothes spend most of their lives waiting if you look at it in the closet in the hamper in the drawer the shirts in your house right now going he never picks me laundry day is their only exciting day because the washing machine is the nightclub of clothes it's dark bubbles happening they're all kind of dancing around in there sure grabs the underwear come on babe let's go you come by you open up the lid they all go we were just soaking could you close that door please there's always an article from someone else's laundry ends up in there by mistake hey who's that i have never seen her before sometimes i take the clothes out they're all twisted together i don't even want to know what happened socks are the most amazing article you do a big laundry go to the dryer take them out count them up one of them got out the son of a  took off on his own what the hell are his chances out there one sock on the run pulling himself along where does he get button sewn on his face join a puppet show what can he do how many times he walked down the street and see a dirty sock just lying there in the street he only made it a couple of blocks he took that risk they do they they will take any risk they hate their lives that much they're in the shoes with stinky feet they're in the drawer they wait for the dryer that's their one chance the night before in the hamper they go tomorrow the dryer are you with me i'll go it alone the dryer door swings open the sock is always waiting up against the side wall he hopes you don't see him then he runs or he grabs onto your sweater gives him a little head start that's how they get away that's how i'm going to get away thank you very much again i really appreciate it thank you oh  thank you very much thank you thank you okay okay i was just over there talk about fear of abandonment so you have any questions for me as long as we have this little time together just to have a laugh or sing a song  oh i love it i love david letterman and i love that show the one thing i do not understand about talk shows is why talk show hosts never have any idea how much time is left in the segment have you ever noticed that they're always going around they're always looking off camera do we have time we out of time do we need time we have time for this yeah it's their own show they have no idea what's happening you never see magnum p.i go should i strangle this guy we're going to take a break i'll punch him in the head we'll take a break we'll come back i'll drive real fast in the car how about that uh what do i miss most about new york i i like uh riding in cabs in new york it is an amazing experience because you're riding these cars these guys they take unbelievable chances with your life you're totally calm and relaxed in the backseat he's flying around the road you're just sitting there it's all happening on television boy that looked dangerous i wouldn't try that in my car never seen an old lady jump straight up like that they really have some spring at that age then you're five minutes late you start rooting for the guy you know he's up on the sidewalk you're going this is a good move he killed the guy we're on time or the dumbest thing of all i think you can think of new york campus well the man knows what he's doing i mean he is driving a little fast but he's a professional cab driver he's got a cab driver's license i can see it right there i don't even know what it takes to get the cab driver's license i think all you need is a face and a name with like eight consonants in a row you ever check out some of the letters in these names the oh with the line through it is my favorite what planet is that from i need a chart of the elements just to report the guy yes officer his name was amal and then the symbol for boron that was not manganese i had the periodic chart with me at the time you've been a great audience thank you very much   you
Jerry Seinfeld,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbIEjy_ww90,we'd like to be a happy meal if that's at all I was in London about a month ago the World Cup is going on I enjoy any sporting event where nations get involved find that the most exciting the Olympics is really my favorite sporting event although I think I have a problem with that silver medal I think if I was an Olympic athlete I would rather come in last then win the silver if you think about it you know you win the gold you feel good you win the bronze I think well least I got something but you win that silver that's like congratulations you almost won of all the losers you came in first of that group you're the number one loser no one lost ahead of you and they don't lose by much you know these short races three hundreds of a second two hundredths of a second I don't know how they live with that the rest of their lives because you got to tell the story everyone wants to hear the story Wow congratulations silver medal did you trip did you not hear the gun go off tell us what happened it's a hundredth of a second you peoples have what was the difference in them in the march in there what was it well it was like from now was like mountain matter now now now is it now - no now no no no no no no no no how was it it was all I trained I worked out I exercised my entire life I never had a date I never had a drink I never had a beer I was doing push-ups insigh was a fetus I flew halfway around the world everybody I knew in my whole life was there like I said I think and they always had that photo finish you know the photo finish was always silver gold this is the whole race gold silver bronze dead last greatest guy in the world never heard of them guys gotta be thinking if I had a pimple I would have won so many events the Olympics don't make sense to me I don't understand their connection to any reality like like in the Winter Olympics they have that biathlon you know that one that combines cross-country skiing with shooting a gun how many Alpine snipers are into this but ski shoot a gun ski bang bang bang to me it's like combining swimming and strangle a guy why don't we have that that makes absolutely as much sense to me just put people in the pool at the end of each lane for the swimmers  and that other one the that I love is the luge you know the lose with a guy where's the slick suit this is what this is on the bobsled run but it's not even a sled it's just Bob it's just a human being hanging on for their life this is the whole sport just oh he pointed his toes oh this guy's a tremendous athlete Baloo's is the only sport I've ever seen that you could have people competing in it against their will and it would be exactly the same you know if they were just grabbing people off the street hey hey hey what is this I don't want to be in the luge now you put the helmet on him you wouldn't really hear him screaming just you're in the luge buddy  well record didn't even want to do it I want to see that event next year the involuntary ludus I consider myself something of a sportsman I like sporty type things scuba diving did that in Australia that was a lot of fun another great activity where your main goal is to not die it's really all I was thinking about the entire day just don't die don't die don't die don't die is a fish is a rock who cares not done I don't want to die let's swim and breathe and live because living is good and dying not as good so I go with this guy mr. scuba guy takes me to the store make sure I buy everything I need I had the waterproof wallet I got now nylon in case we run into a sea turtle that can break a 50  waterproof watch that's important G and completely out of oxygen and look at the time geez now I'm dead and I'm late I like these somewhat high-risk things the scuba the I've gone hang gliding I've gone skydiving I like a little bit of risk I don't maybe that's why I do this I saw a thing actually a study that said speaking in front of a crowd is considered the number one fear of the average person I found that amazing number two was death death is number two this means to the average person if you have to be at a funeral you would rather be in the casket than doing the eulogy skydiving was definitely the scariest thing I've ever done let me ask you this question in regards to the skydiving what is the point of the helmet in the skydiving I mean can you kind of make it you jump out of that plane that chute doesn't open the helmet is now wearing you for protection later on the helmets talking with the other helmets going it's a good thing he was there or I would have hit the ground directly you never jump out of a plane unless you got a human being strapped underneath it that's basic safety there are many things that we could point to as proof that the human being is not smart the helmet is my personal favorite the fact that we had to invent the helmet now why did we invent the helmet well because we were participating in many activities that were cracking our heads we looked at the situation we chose not to avoid these activities but to just make little plastic hats so that we can continue our head cracking lifestyles the only thing dumber than the helmet is the helmet law the point of which is to protect a brain that is functioning so poorly it's not even trying to stop the cracking of the head that it's in at least the helmet is functional clothing I appreciate that clothing to me for the most part it's just a tremendous pain in the ass if you think of the amount of time mental effort physical energy that goes into your clothes picking them buying them is that go with that I don't think I can wear that I'm missing a button this is dirty I gotta get something new that's up my ass can't go I think we should all wear the same exact clothes because it seems to be what happens eventually anyway any time you see a movie or a TV show with these people from the future or another planet they're all wearing the same outfit I think the decision just gets made alright everyone from now on it's just gonna be the one piece silver suit with the V stripe and the boots that's the outfit we're gonna be visiting other planets you want to look like a team here individuality thing is over the dry cleaner I can't stand cuz I don't think he's doing it I don't know what goes on back there but I cannot conceive of such a thing as actual dry cleaning we all accept it cuz we see the stores everybody but think about dry what what is dry you can't clean something dry what do they do tap it shake it blow on it there's gonna be some kind of a liquid back there you ever get something on your clothes and get it off with a fingernail that's dry cleaning that is the only dry clean I brought this guy in a suede jacket got spots on it cuz I was in the rain says there's nothing we can do water ruins leather no aren't cows outdoors a lot of the time when it rains or the cows go up to the farm house hey let us say we're all wearing leather out here hey open up man I'm suede I'm living suede dry clean only is definitely the only warning label that human beings actually respect you know they look at cigarettes this look if you can to kill you kids everything ah screw it I'll do whatever the hell I want don't drink this medicine and operate heavy machinery out glug glug glug glug who cares that's what people don't know what the hell are doing I'm a pro but if you have something that's dry clean only and someone goes to put it in the wash machine no but into why frankly are you crazy Eddy of mine it is amazing what people will believe I mean I watched these infomercials late at night if it gets late enough the product start to look good to me I have actually found myself sitting there thinking you know I don't think I have a knife that can cut through a shoe I don't think any of my knives are good enough to cut through shoes I'm gonna get this knife and cut my shoes up that seems pretty good I think the dumbest thing you can think late at night is you know I'm gonna get this thing in get in shape you know it's like 3:00 in the morning you got potato chip crumbs on your shirt there you got one eye open one sock hanging off of the foot you know yeah I'm gonna start working out with this thing I'm gonna order this thing this is all I need to get in shape this is a fantastic device just rip off can't stop getting ripped off we're gonna get ripped off we think we're not we think we're very clever we think we're gonna foil the crooks you know we go to the beach go in the water put your wallet in the sneaker who's gonna know what criminal mind could penetrate this fortress of security I put it down by the toe they never looked there they check the heels they move on well you have a move a TV set in the backseat of your car then you got to leave the car on the street for a few minutes so you put a sweater over the two it's a couple of sweaters that's all one of them is square with antenna coming out of it so feeble the things we come up with the foil crooks you don't like the wanted posters at the post office your ear there you got your package you're trying to mail something this guy's wanted in 12 states yeah now what okay you know I checked the guy standing in line behind me if it's not him that's pretty much all I can do why don't they just hold on to this guy when they're taking his picture the guy's there with you come out from behind the camera grab now we don't do that we take their picture we let him go that's how we get the front and side shot the front is his face the side is him leaving why don't they put the pictures of the criminals on the postage stamps let the postman look for him he's out there walking around all day he's got the uniform on can he do something we got another letter for you here mr. Johnson I think that's him so we really did have a good time on this is the end of our of a long tour and when you're on the road you always have to do whatever anyone suggests that day because you have nothing to do and you have no ideas so you do whatever I want anyone suggests so a couple weeks ago we go to the track I haven't I did that a couple of times in my life betting on the horses you can't possibly win I don't even understand what we're betting on I mean to the horses know that it's a race are they aware what is going on here after the race of the horses walking back to the stable I was third I was first I was nine I think they're thinking oat bag I get my oat bag now oat bag time I got a bet on this idiot I mean I'm sure the horses have some idea that the jockey is in a big hurry I mean he's on him he's hitting him with the thing he's going come on come on this is obviously he he's in a hurry the jockeys in the hurry but the horse must get to the end and go where he was just here what was the point of that this is where we were that was the longest possible route you could take why did we just stay here we would have been first I'll tell you one thing the horses definitely do not know they do not know you should accidentally trip and break your leg at any point during the race we blow your brains out I think they're missing that little tidbit of information I think if they knew that you'd see some mighty careful Stepan coming down that homestretch take it easy take it easy you win all place whatever
Jerry Seinfeld,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT7bIWDJ5w0,"- Socks are the most
amazing article of clothing. They hate their lives. They're in the shoes with stinky feet, the boring drawers. The dryer is their only chance to escape and they all know it. They do escape from the dryer. The plan it in the
hamper the night before. Tomorrow, the dryer, I'm going. You wait here. The dryer door swings open, the sock is waiting up
against the side wall. He hopes you don't see him
and he goes down the road. Dun dun dun, dun dun dun. They get buttons sewed on
their face, join a puppet show. So they're showing me on television the detergents for
getting out blood stains. Is this a violent image to anybody? Blood stains? I mean, c'mon, you got a t-shirt with blood stains all over it, maybe laundry isn't your
biggest problem right now. You gotta get the harpoon
out of your chest first. The dating world is not a fun world. It's a pressure world,
it's a world of tension, it's a world of pain. And you know, if a woman
comes over over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom
ready cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I don't know what they need. I know I don't have it, I know that. You know what they need? Women seem to need a lot of cotton balls. This is the one, always been one of the
most amazing things to me. I have no cotton balls.
We're all human beings. What is the story? I've never had one. I never bought one, I never needed one. I've never been in a situation
where I thought to myself, I could use a cotton ball right now. I could certainly get out of this mess. Women need 'em, and they
don't need one or two. They need thousands of them. They need bags, they're
like peat moss bags, have you ever seen these giant bags? They're huge and two days later
they're out, they're gone. The bag is empty, where are
the cotton balls, ladies? What are you doing with them? The only time I ever see 'em is in the bottom of your little wastebasket. There's two or three and
they look like they've been through some horrible experience. Tortured, interrogated, I don't
know what happened to 'em. I once went out with a girl. She left a little zip lock baggie of cotton balls at my house. I didn't know what to do. I took 'em out and put them on the floor like little tumble weeds. I thought maybe the
cockroaches would see it, figure this was a dead
town, let's move on. The dating world is a world of pressure. Let's face it, a date is a job interview that lasts all night. The only difference between a date and a job interview is
not many job interviews there's a chance you'll end
up naked at the end of it. You know, well Bill, the boss thinks you're the man for the position. Why don't you strip down and meet some of the people
you'll be working with? I swear, I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking. I don't get it, okay? I admit, I'm not getting the signals. I am not getting it. Women, they're so subtle,
everything they do is subtle. Men are not subtle. We are obvious. Women know what men want,
men know what men want. What do we want? We want women, that's it. It's the only thing we know for sure. It really is. We want women. How do we get them? Oh, we don't know about
that, we don't know. The next step after that, we have no idea. This is why you see men honking car horns, yelling from construction sites. These are the best ideas we've had so far. The car horn honk, is that the beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? The man is in the car. The woman walks by the front of the car. He honks (car honking sound) This man is out of ideas. How does (car honking sound) I don't think she likes me. The amazing thing is that we
still get women, don't we? Men, I mean men are with women. You see men with women. How are men getting
women, many people wonder? Let me tell you a little
bit about our organization. Wherever women are? We have a man working on
the situation right now. Now he may not be our best man. Okay, we have a lot of areas to cover, but someone from our
staff is on the scene. That's why I think men get frustrated when we see women reading articles like 'where to meet men.' We're here. We are everywhere. We're honking our horns
to serve you better. So I'm on line at the supermarket. Two women in front of me. One of them, her total was $8. The other, $3. They both, of course, choose
to pay by the use of the -  Check. - Check. Now. The fact is if that it is
a woman in front of you that's writing out the check,
you will not be waiting long. I have noticed that women
are very fast with checks, you know cause they
write out so many checks. The key is they can never
find in their purse, they don't know where that is, but the checkbook, they got that. They never fumble for the checkbook. The checkbook comes out of a holster. Who do I make it out to? (Seinfeld Theme) There's my ID. There's something about a check that, to a man it's not masculine. I don't know exactly what it is. I think, to a man, a check is
like a note from your mother that says 'I don't have any money, but if you contact these people, I'm sure they'll stick up for me, if you just trust me this one time. I don't have any money but I have these. I wrote on these. Is this of any value at all?' Apparently Plato, who
came up with the concept of the platonic relationship, was pretty excited about it. He named it after himself. He said yeah, I got this
new thing. Platonic. My idea, my name, calling it after myself. What I do is, I go out with the girls, I talk with them, don't do anything, and go right home. What do you think? I think it's going to be big. I bet you there were other guys in history that tried to get
relationships named after them but it didn't work. You know, I bet there were
guys that tried to do it. Just went hiya, my name's Rico, would you like to go to bed immediately? Hey, it's a riconic relationship. You know, I think that, even if you've had a
relationship with someone, or let's say especially if you've had a relationship with someone, and you try to become friends afterwards, it's very difficult, isn't this? It's hard, because you know each
other so well, you know. You know all each others' tricks. It's like two magicians trying
to entertain each other. You know, one goes, look a rabbit! The other one goes, so? I believe that's your card. Look, why don't we just
saw each other in half and call it a night, okay? So, I move into the center lane now I get ahead of this woman, who felt for some reason, I guess, she thought that I cut her off. So, she pulls up alongside of me, gives me the finger. It seems like such an
arbitrary, ridiculous thing to just pick a finger and
you show it to the person. It's a finger, what does it mean? Someone shows me one of their fingers, and I'm supposed to feel bad. Is that the way it's supposed to work? I mean, you could just give
someone the toe, couldn't you? I would feel worse if I got the toe than if I got the finger. Cause it's not easy to
give someone the toe. You gotta get the shoe
off, the sock off, drive, and get it up in the,
look at that toe, buddy. I mean that's really insulting,
to get the toe, isn't it? I got ripped off for about the, 18th time. Now the first couple of
times you go through it, it's very upsetting, and your first reaction or
one of your friends will say, call the police. You really should call the police. So you think to yourself,
you know you watch TV, you think yeah, I'm calling the police, stakeouts, manhunts. I'm gonna see some real action. Right, you think that. So the police come over to your house, they fill out the report. They give you your copy. Now, unless they give the crook his copy, I don't really think we're
gonna crack this case, do you? It's not like Batman where
there's three crooks in the city, and everybody pretty
much knows who they are. Very few crooks even go to the trouble to come up with a theme
for their careers anymore. It makes them a lot tougher to spot. Did you lose a Sony? It
could be the Penguin. I think we can round him up. He's dressed like a penguin. We can find him, he's a penguin. One of the problems in life is that when you're a kid you have a certain way of working out disagreements, and those laws do not
work in the adult world. One of the man ways that
kids resolve any dispute is by calling it. One of them say, I got the front seat. I wanted the front seat. I called it, and the other kid knows
he's got nothing to say. He called it, what can I do? If there was a kid court
of law, it holds up. Your Honor, my client did
ask for the front seat, and the judge would go, did he call it? Well, no, he didn't call it- Bang. He has to call it, case closed. Objection overruled. Most men like working on things. Tools, objects, fixing things. This is what men enjoy doing. Have you ever noticed if a guy's out in his driveway working
on something with tools, how all of the other
men in the neighborhood are magnetically drawn to this activity? They just come wandering out
of the house like zombies. Man, it's true. Men hear a drill, it's
like a dog whistle, just. You know they go running up
to the living room curtain and go honey, I think Jim's
working on something over there. So they run over to the guy. Now they don't actually help the guy, no. They just wanna hang around the area where work is being done. That's what men want to do. We want to watch the guy,
we want to talk to him. We want to ask him dumb questions. Are you using a Phillips head? You know, we feel involved. That's why when they
have construction sites, they have to have those
wood panel fences around it. That's just to keep the men out. They cut those little holes for us so we can see what the hell is going on, but if they don't cut those holes, we are climbing those fences. Right over there. What are you using, the
steel girders down here? Yeah, that'll hold. As a guy, I don't know how I
can break up with another guy. You know what I mean? I don't know how to say Bill, I feel I need to see other men. Do you know what I mean? There is nothing I can do. I have to wait for someone to die. I think that's the only way
out of this relationship. It could be a long time. You see, the great thing about guys is that we can become friends
based on almost nothing. Just two guys will become
friends because they're two guys. That's almost all we
need to have in common, cause sports and women is
really all we talk about. If there was no sports and no women, the only thing guys would ever say is so, what's in the refrigerator? No, I do not like the bank. I've heard the expression laughing all the way to the bank, I have never seen anyone actually do it. And those bank lines. I hate it when there's
nobody on the line at all, you know, you go to the
bank and it's empty, and you still have to go
through the little maze. Could you get a little
piece of cheese for me? I'm almost at the front. I'd like a reward for this, please. I've come to the conclusion that there are certain
friends in your life, that they're just always your friends and you have to accept it. You see them, you don't
really want to see them, you don't call them, they call you. You don't call back, they call again. The only way to get
through talking with people you don't really have
anything in common with is to pretend that you're hosting
your own little talk show. This is what I do. You pretend there's a
little desk around you. There's a little chair over there, and you interview them. The only problem with this
is there's no way to say hey, it's been great
having you on the show, we're out of time. Went out to dinner the other night, check came at the end of
the meal as it always does. Never liked the check at
the end of the meal system, cause money's a very different thing before and after you eat. Before you eat, money has no value. You know how you don't care
about money when you're hungry? You sit down in the restaurant, you're like the ruler of an empire, more drinks, appetizers, quickly, quickly. It will be the greatest meal of our lives. Then after the meal,
you got the pants open, you got the napkins destroyed, cigarette butt in the mashed potatoes. Then the check comes at that moment. People are always upset, you know, they're mystified by the check, they're- What is this? How could this be? They start passing it around the table. Does this look right to you? We're not hungry now. Why are we buying all this food? I think the only reason
we go to the dry cleaner is so I can say to the dry cleaner, well, it's ruined, and of course the dry cleaner can respond, it's not our fault. We're not responsible. We just ruin the clothes, that
ends our legal obligation. See, the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that
this is actually possible. Right, they're cleaning our clothes, but they're not getting anything wet. It's all dry. I know there's gotta be
some liquids back there, some fluids that they're using. There's no such thing as dry cleaning. When you get something on your shirt, every get something on your shirt and you try to get it off like that, that's dry cleaning. I don't think that's what
they're doing back there. They don't have 80 guys going c'mon, hurry up. There's a lot of shirts today. I'm not an investor. People always tell me you should have your money working for you. I've decided I'll do the work, I'm gonna let the money relax. You know what I mean? Cause you send your money
out there working for you, a lot of times, it gets fired. You go back there, What happened? I had my money, it was
here, working for me. Yeah, I remember your money. Showing up late, taking time off. We had to let him go."
Jerry Seinfeld,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuO0NCGyOwI,"remember the first time you heard about Halloween is the idea of it is just more than a kid brain could even handle this information they're giving out what who is giving out candy who who is giving out candy what do I have to do take me with you I'll do anything they want I want to be a boy I can wear that I'll wear anything maybe that Halloween mask another rubber band on the back of that Halloween mask I was good for about 10 seconds the cord snapped out of that cheap little staple they put it in there we go to your first house trick boys snap it bro thank you wait up and that mask that was brutal who are trying to breathe through that little air hold and use like a hole punch from a loosely thing here breathe through that for eight hours that all sweaty in there and the mass kept snapping you have to keep picking pull the string through it kept getting tighter and tighter for things slicing into your eyeballs man can't breathe can't see eventually your eyeballs pop out in front of the mask that point just take the mask all that hell with it Bing bong yeah that's me yeah yeah candy what do you care stupid charade they really got us trained to use that cash machine now don't think I mean no just go right up to that thing and people are just it's like we're like chickens in an experiment just waiting for that pellet to come down the  you see people the cash machine they're just they're just tick tick tick tick tick tick waiting for the sound you know the sound you waiting for the sound that's what we're trained to hear the here comes the money sound you know what's exciting exciting is anyone even working in the bank anymore what are they doing is it just pretending you know shuffling papers around talking on phones that aren't even plugged in i think that bank building is just a charade that they have to keep going because they need that two feet of wall to hold up the cash machine I think my favorite dog thing is when you have to leave him in the car and he's just sitting there in the front seat cuz the dog see the dog body in the car seat is the only time that your head in his head are at the same height you know what I mean cuz they n they love when they're up there and the front they go this is more like I think you and I should be together often except when they turn when you turn they can't handle it turns you know got no thumbs take it easy dog stick their heads out doing late they love that in the car nothing I don't know what it does for him but there's just no doubt this is the thing you know when they are doing that I don't know what they're thinking like boy if I could run this fast does anybody have a dog where they clean up after him on the street do you do that really you do you have to you don't allow it so how big is the dog right now he's just like a Hindenburg Doug you don't allow it this dog is trained ladies and gentlemen you are not allowed to go Lisa send away for everything in the back of every single cold cereal box even the prizes that were void where prohibited I took that risk well what do they want to prohibit a little bag of plastic monkeys what is it danger we don't want these monkeys in the northwest we want to avoid them in that area send away for it anyway you so have nightmares the police are gonna come over my house you order these little monkeys son do you realize you're living in a prohibited zone here these monkeys are void in this area used to be the box tops you all remember sending in Box Tops and then at one point they switched to the proof of purchase seal we didn't trust us with the box tub apparently they thought they needed more proof what happened you think that we're getting some forgeries down there at Battle Creek run these Cocoa Puffs flesh through the infrared scanner one more time Jim I think this little Timmy might be trying to pull a fashion but I think to me the scariest thing in food is that expiration date on the milk they really they scare you with you know never have milk the day after the day you know and the spoon is trembling it's a how do they know that that is the exact day you know what I mean it's just so definite they brand it right into the side of the card that's your day right there the cows tip them off when they're milking a minute July 3rd I think they sat around the Beef Association how about bonkers beef syndrome what are you thinking up no no no it doesn't sound serious enough silly Mead condition no no no look come on Frank it's 11:00 let's get out of here how about mad cow mad cow on with the mad cow just you know I don't know what the hell it is we're doing a show where Lane decides she has had it with the lines in the ladies room you know what I mean ladies you hate those lines don't you you look at the men's room and you think I could go right in there so Elaine decides to do this anyway that's what the shows about but I like the idea of the women's room you have a door says women on it and women come right out of it what more do you want men say to me where to meet women I say there you go there's a door what could be clearer the head says women they gotta be in there the men's room on the other hand is a nauseating disgusting place and every man in there is a revolting perverted human slide men don't want to meet relate or deal with any other man in the men's room we don't even use our hands we touch everything with the feet toilets closets and those we become a Ranga tango says we're gonna make Noah go to put ropes in there so we could swing in PE swing in I like the hand blow it takes a little bit longer but I feel when you're in a room with a sickening stench you want to spend as much time as you can you don't want to race outta there you want to linger socialize meet people hey nice shoes sorry I feed on I don't think dry cleaners are doing it you know dry cleaning as if that's even possible we all accept it well I'm gonna get this dry-cleaned I'll take it to the dry cleaner that's just part of the language and we all assume this is being done how what are they doing dry what could you do dry totally dry to get something clean I give you shirts got tomato stain on it get it out dry what are you gonna do I want to see what you're gonna do tap it shake it blow on it what can you do to clean something dry we had a show where dry cleaner was wearing something of mine which I think that they do I wouldn't think wanna mean but imagine bumping into your dry cleaner at a party and he's wearing

we pack it in the glacier put it on the back of the frozen truck driven by a polar bear by the time it gets to you it's one degree below room temperature that's the best we could do why the drink culture Gatorade now three different Gator races the new commercial Gatorade series you need three to survive one to prepare one to perform want to recover I just went from the fridge to the couch how many electrolytes that I lose they're always got stuff for us too I went to the movies the other day so there's a new announcement in the movie theater mixed in with the trailers please pick up the garbage from around your seat after the movie oh okay maybe I'll bring my orange jumpsuit and it wouldn't stick with a nail in it too face I want to work my way down the highway after the credits I'm not picking nothing uh I'm the one that threw it down why would I throw it down and then pick it up there is an agreed-upon deal between us and the movie theatre people whoever the hell they are and that deal is understood by every single person in this room the deal is you're ripping us off okay we get it we're fine with it trying to overpriced oversized crap we shouldn't be eating to begin with fine it's all fine in exchange for that when I'm done with something I opened my hand that roll down eight rows not sticking my arm down into that dark scary hole see if I can pry out three goobers that have been soda welded there since the Shawshank Redemption what have they done for us a cup holder that is the only feature they have added the cup holder growing out of the armrest while you're resting your arm you certainly won't be able to hold a cup the cup holder defines American culture at this point we can't hold the cup people getting a guy where is the cup holder in this car this is insane we don't want to grip things hands-free is everyone's looking for hands-free everything whenever I go on Amazon I reset that one-click ordering right one click that's it you need me to click twice I don't even want it anymore I'm not clicking get some wheels on the luggage get me a belt clip for my cellphone get me an earpiece too and not one that you're taking it out drill it right into the side of my skull you have a dog and the dog they give you a leash with this extra leash wound up inside the case the dog pulls it you hit the button let the lion out like he's a Marlin nobody wants to nobody wants to do anything with lion bed anything if you're not in bed it's work even death even death people want to be in bed I always read that he died in his death bed I always read that in the paper why would you even buy a bed like that how are you going to start feeling better sleeping in a death bed where is that section of the furniture store these are our death beds over here we also have a dead side table death reading lamp is that a death clock radio yes but there's no snooze either you get up or you know hurry so anyway I'm thrilled we back here in New York I love that certain things about New York never change they're always constant they're always there for you the cabbies and the Bo what is with the Bo and these guys how long are these shifts can we get this man a 10-minute break for a shower you're in the back it's coming through the glass you're just going what in the world Madeline when they put that cherry pop it stuff on the dashboard so you get the cherry bo I don't know what that's supposed to be even fruit showers more often than this the finding to me about being in these caves is that when you're in Manhattan for some reason you don't get scared no matter how fast the guy goes well you know he's driving fast and recklessly but he's a professional he's got a cab drivers license I can see it right there I don't even know what it takes to get a cab driver's license I think all you need is a face this seems to be their big qualification no blank heads are allowed driving cabs in this town also helps to have a name with like 8 consonants in a row ever see some of the letters in these names what is the O with the line through it by the way what planet is that from you need a chart of the elements if you want to report the guy yes officer his name was Amal and then the symbol for boron no it was not manganese I had the periodic chart with me at the time but I love to travel I love it whether it's a car or it's a plane like to get out there like to keep it moving I loved airports feel safe in airports thanks to the high-caliber individuals we have working at x-ray security how about this crack squad of savvy motivated personnel the way you want to set up your airport security as you want the short heavyset woman at the front with the skin tight uniform that's your first line of defense you want those pants so tight the flap in front of the zipper is pulled itself open you can see the metal tangs hanging on for dear life then you put the bag on the conveyor belt goes to the little luggage car wash then you have that other genius down the other end looking in the little x-ray TV screen this I'm stayin has chosen to stand in front of x-rays 14 hours a day as his profession looking in that thing I I have looked in that TV screen I cannot make out one object he's standing there what is that a hairdryer with a scope on it that looks okay keep it moving some sort of bowling ball candle yeah I got no problem with that just no we don't want to hold up the line so I go to the bathroom in the airport what is the story on the sinks in Airport bathrooms if they will not give us a twisted on twisted off human style faucet is that too risky for the general population too dangerous we better install the one-handed spring-loaded pain-in-the-ass Alcatraz style faucets you know those ones we got to go hey boy I got a little water then put on a couple drops what is it that I think we would do with a foster turn them all on full run out into the parking lot laughing pushing each other into the bushes come on the water's on let's go I turned it on oh wow you idiot we're businessmen we're gonna miss our plane who cares water that's how they think we'll be hey do the people that work in these little shops in the airport have any idea what the prices are every place else in the world yeah $14 tuna sandwich we think that's fair that's what we charge in our country hey you get on the plane pilot of course always has to come on the PA system this guy so excited about being a pilot he can't even stand himself well I'm gonna take it up to about 20,000 and I'm gonna make a left by Pittsburgh then I'm gonna make a right by Chicago then I'm gonna bring it down to 15,000 giving you the whole route all his moves we're in the back going yeah fine that's all you know do whatever the hell you got to do I don't know this end up where it says on the ticket really why bother him with what I'm doing knocking on the cockpit door I'm having the peanuts now yeah that's what we're doing back here don't I keep you posted I'm not gonna have a mall now I'm just gonna have a few I don't want to finish it because it's such a big bad then the stewardesses have to come out they have to do their little emergency equipment show you know that thing they do one of them reads it the other one acts it out hey we have seatbelts and oxygen man's things for you to you they show you how to use a seatbelt in case you haven't been in a car since 1965 oh you lift up on the buckle oh I was trying to break the metal apart I thought that's how it works I was gonna try and tear the fabric part of the belt I thought if I could just get it started then they'd always point out the emergency exits always with that very vague point though isn't it where that where the hell with these places B which is sad planes at a 90 degree degree angle your hair is on fire you're looking for this how do you think you're gonna do there she's thinking I'm getting out before you're getting out you're dead you're dead I'm going then they always have to close that first class curtain - I always give you that little look maybe if you would work a little harder I wouldn't have to do this it's a whole tiny world on the airplane isn't it is always that little tiny table their tiny computer was in little crab see tiny food tiny utensils tiny liquor bottles tiny bathroom tiny sink tiny mirror tiny fossils so he's a small problem gonna be a slight delay we're gonna be a little late I always go in the airplane bathroom even if I don't have to go I got to go in there it's nice it's like your own little apartment on the plane isn't it go in there lock the door the life comes on after a second it's like a little surprise party but I'm always impressed with the amount of equipment that they have in that place I mean it's a little but they got the tissues towels closets compartments tiny slot for used razor blades they always have that who is shaving on the plane and shaving so much they're using up razor blades is this what's happening what is the Wolfman flying to never crash sex who could shave that much higher so I'm supposed to go down to Florida next week after we're done here that's where all my relatives live I don't really want to go Florida not old people down there you know they live in those minimum security prisons that's where they put all the old people what's with all the security there with the guard gate with the arm coming down everyone's got a uniform guns are the old people trying to escape or are people stealing old people what is the security problem I just can't drive around there you know how the old people drive they drive slow they sit low that is their motto state flag of Florida should be just a steering wheel with a hat and two knuckles on and that left turn signal on for when they left the house that morning that's a legal turn in Florida it's known as an eventual left you can signal this week turn any following year ladies and gentlemen the great Jerry Seinfeld thank you so nice to be here so happy to do this and I just wanted to say before I even started talking about TM I had a horrible thought on my way down here a horrible thought and I have to tell you about it I had a thought that perhaps the Amazon drone idea and let me apologize in advance for how horrible this thought is could possibly be a cynical marketing exercise to get us thinking about Amazon between Thanksgiving and Christmas I know that sounds crazy and I know it's highly unlikely but isn't it quite a coincidence that on Cyber Monday Amazon's all over the goddamn news with a stupid project that will never happen no one wants their chewy was attacked by drones how could this possibly ever be anything but all it takes is a bad kid and a rock and it's over the whole thing is in the toilet does is there not who needs a diaper in ten seconds that we can who's planning there like that badly it's just I know it's horrible to think that a company of such integrity would do something like that but I just wanted to say that I had the thought anyway so I want to talk to you about TM which I have now been doing 41 years 40 41 years I don't remember exactly how I started it was a some kid I knew I had just gone to college and you know we were still kind of in the flush of the feeling of the 60s and I just wanted to try any new thing that I heard about and so I went and I and I learned TM and I do remember the very first time I did it and I remember that I was up the entire night because I never felt that good before and I had terrible acne I was I think I was about 18 and it just it all just went away and and I became a world famous comedian that's my story that's the entire story of my life and now here's the tragic part of my TM story slightly tragic so I'm doing TM from 1972 and I started and I didn't do the morning once you're supposed to do with twice a day and I stopped doing the morning one pretty early in me doing it because I didn't understand getting out of bed and then resting I had trouble with that concept to get out of bed now rest okay so I don't know maybe I did it for a couple of months and then I just stopped but I was very regular with my afternoon meditation and when I was doing the TV series in which I was the star of the show the executive producer the head writer casting and editing for 22 to 24 episodes on network television that cable network for nine years okay that's a lot of work and I'm a regular guy pretty much you know I'm not one of these crazy people that has endless boundless energy I'm just a normal guy but that was not a normal situation to be in and so what I would do is every day when everybody would have lunch I would do TM and then while we'd go back to work and then I would eat while I was working because I had missed lunch but that is how I survived the nine years it was that 20 minutes in the middle of the day would save me because you know and you also you got to imagine and I don't I don't mean I know everybody's life is hard and every job is hard enough but I mean when it's your name on the goddamn show the pressure is it's it's intense and then the show got successful and everybody expected each week to be even better than the last and it was a lot of pressure and I loved every second of it but it was a lot of pressure and a lot of work and was all great but never could have accomplished it without TM but I was not doing the morning one as I told you and this past January Bob Roth who everybody loves he taught my kids TM and so one day we were standing in my kitchen and I was signing was telling about something that I was doing he says you know you really should try doing the morning one forty-one years in I find out I'm not doing it right that's the tragic part of the story oh so now I do the morning one and now okay so my life now which is you know apologized I don't like to take up too much time but you know so I've got a wife I've got three kids I do stand-up comedy almost every weekend I I fly out Friday I'll do a show in one city then I'll fly to another city I'll do a show in another city I'll come back like Saturday night like four or five in the morning and then I have three little kids and and I do this other little internet show and so I'm very busy and now and I'm 60 by the way I'm 60 years old and I really thought well it's the time has come I'm 60 the time has come to kind of throttle back the output that I'm you know of life I need to work less I need to do less because I'm old and you know let's cut the engines and glide a little bit well so Bob introduced me which I should have known 40 years ago but I didn't to the morning TM and my entire energy and focus and ability to function all day and come home and have the family I'm 60 year old guy with little kids it's all screwed up it shouldn't be like this and now I am functioning on this level that I really did not think was possible for someone my age and at that you know I just thought it would be too much so that's how my life changed dramatically this year meeting Bob and doing TM properly and I can't tell you and I and I've become obsessive also talking to people about and I've my press officer is here I got him to do it I got my assistant every person I meet now I'm just grabbing them by the lapels and going you got to do this because it's it's just a dumb way to live not doing it it's just dumb I'll quote a line from Richard Pryor there's one of my favorite lines is it's actually from a bit heated about racism and he starts the bit and he says before we even talk about racism he says you know it's hard just being a person forget about having to deal with racial hostility just being a person is hard and that that would be my introduction to people who don't think they need TM being a person is hard now all these people that we just saw these are people that really have some enormous challenges but all of you here by virtue of the fact that you here I know your yourse laminate you're killing yourself and that's fun and great but you don't need to die for what you want to accomplish and that's what TM is about and nabob and I did a show we did I think it was ABC Good Morning America and I came up with the line that TM is like you have a cellphone and someone gives you the charger and you go oh this is now I can keep using this thing and it will work all the time the other way that I described it so there are a lot of people here that don't do TM that are just just here to kind of learn a little bit about okay so the other way I'll describe it to you is then I can see from the faces who does it and doesn't do it by the way the other way I will describe TM to you is do you know how three days a year you get a good night's sleep and you wake up and feel like oh this is how I should feel all the time but you can't get more than three good nights sleeps a year because of the circumstances of your life well TM you can you can have that every day that every day you're just the bar on the cell phone is all the way up you leave the house and the charger is full you know that tremendous feeling of power when your phone is fully charged and somebody calls you go I want to hear every detail of this story I am loaded with juice that that's what TM is I will now take questions I realize anything you want to answer I'll take a couple of queries they taught me just to do five minutes I think I just did it but anything you want to ask me about - I do it and here's the other thing that's crazy okay here's a crazy TM thing well look I am only getting five hours sleep as it is I'm not going to get up earlier than that to do TM it works it's better you'll get you'll feel better asleep in four and a half hours and doing that 20 because that's deeper than anything you get when you're sleep and look at your bed when you get out of it what does it look like it looks like a war went on in there and that's not restful all you did was stop and you took the fight from your day into the bed but you're fighting all day you're fighting all night you need a break folks you need a break that's what TM is thank you very much you candy was my whole life when I was a kid that was first ten years of my life I think the only clear thought I had was getting candy that was a family friends school they're just obstacles in the way of the candy I'm out for the candy here I'm just thinking good candy get candy get can they get can to get candy that's why you have to teach kids not to take candy from a stranger if they're playing in a playground because there's such candy  idiot brains it's just this man s candy I'm going with him goodbye don't care what happens to me I can take it can't eat a family gift Anna don't go they'll talk to you they'll kidnap your doesn't matter he has no Henry I have to take that chance it can they get their  Kenny so the first time you hear the the concept of Halloween when you're a kid your brain can't even process the information you can you're like what what is this what did you say so what did you say about giving out candy who was giving out to everyone that we know is just giving out candy are you kidding me when is this happening where why take me with you I gotta be a part of this I'll do anything that they want I can wear that I'll wear anything I have to wear I'll do anything I have to do to get the candy from those fools they're so stupidly giving it away so the first couple years I made my own costumes which of course suck the ghost the hobo no good then finally third year begging the parents got the Superman Halloween costume not surprisingly cardboard box cellophane top mask included remember the rubberband on the back of that mask that was a quality item there wasn't it that was good for about 10 seconds before it snapped out of that cheap little staple they put it in there with you go to your first house trick or snack but broke I don't believe it wait up you guys I gotta fix it hey wait up wait up that's what you say they don't say wait they say wait up hey wait up cuz when you're little your life is up the future is up everything you want is up wait up hold up shut up mom I'll clean up let me stay parents of course just the opposite everything is down just calm down slow down come down here sit down put that down so I had my little costume I was physically ready I was preparing myself I did not try on the costume prior to Halloween do you remember this is an obscure one but on the side of the box I remember this on my Superman costume it actually said do not attempt to fly they printed that as a warning because kids were putting it on going off the roof I love the idea of the kid who's stupid enough to think he actually is Superman but smart enough to check that box before he goes off the roof let me see if it says anything about me being Superman oh wait a second here I so anyway but my hopes were up I was thinking that this is probably the same exact costume that Superman wears himself you put these things on it's not exactly the super fit that you are hoping for it looks more like Superman's pajamas is what it looks like it's all kind of loose and flowing and the neckline kind of comes down about there flimsy little ribbon string in the back plus my mother makes me wear my winter coat over the costume anyway I don't recall Superman wearing a jacket not like I had cheap corduroy phony fur boy I'm Superman but it's a little chilly out and I'm glad I've got this cheap little ten-year-old kids jacket so I'm going out I'm trick-or-treating but the mask the rubberband keeps breaking it keeps getting shorter I'm fixing it it's getting tighter and tighter on my face you know when it starts slicing into your eyeballs there and you you're trying to breathe through that little hole getting all sweaty I can't see I can't breathe oh we got to keep going we got to get to get it and a half hour and we just take that mask all that how are they Bing bong H me give me the candy yeah I'm Superman look at the pant legs what do you care for those the last couple years

always ask you those same stupid questions what are you supposed to be I'm supposed to be done by now you want to move it along with the three musketeers I got 18 houses on this block sweetheart just hit the bag we hit the road that's the way it works sometimes they give you that little white bag twisted on the top you know that's going to be some crap candy doesn't have the official Halloween markings on it hold it lady wait a second what is this the orange marshmallows shaped like a big peanut do me a favor you keep that yeah we have all the doorstops we need already thank you we're going for name can be only this year everything about the life of clothes what is the life of clothes really what does it come down to it's waiting isn't it in the closet in the hamper in the drawer the shirts in your closet right now going he never picks me they're either on you or home hoping to get picked tomorrow and their whole existence it's just a steady decline isn't it when they first come in the house they're new they got price tags I'm gonna rap a little tissue paper they're the big star then after a while they start to fall out of the rotation during the back of the closet there has forms it's so tragic one day they're being shown off at parties nightclub next day they're using a clean painter of New Year's needs a hanger life is that you've never gone into you guys you know it's always like the Dick Van Dyke Blanc take another crack here's the thing how many times have you seen chicken of the sea tuna and never stop to go look al kind of insulting name is what do they think I don't know what the hell of fish is what are they chicken of the Caesar well you think of it as a chicken okay in the see it's not really a chicken of course but you think of it as a chicken because we don't want to go through the whole explanation of aquatic life to you idiots so think of it it's kind of like a chicken but in the water dribbling a couple years ago we had to save the three stupidest whales in the entire world up here in Canada there under that frozen lake we'll go under the ice I mean aren't there some intelligent whales that we can help out do we have to always help these idiots we'll go under swimming alone  out I read the scientists estimated it would take these whales six extra months to complete the migration down to Mexico the idiots I mean the other way also have to be going hey where were you guys the stupid whales ago did you see us on TV we're doing a show this week where are a couple of interesting storylines one of them is that I'm involved with a masseuse masseuse masseuse masseuse and what is plural masseur thank you very much you are dismissed from the SAT finals here we will not meet you for the college ball reunion I don't know what is the plural of masseuse masseuse is female masseur is male but what's what's the plurals masseuse masseuse is masseuse I miss I vote it's the same for both it's like fish one fish two fish so I I was talking to a bunch of masseuse today that's what you say I don't think so who's ever doing that though it doesn't come up that often that you meet a bunch of masseuse those ads late at night for the run the craftmatic you know the contour chair get your legs up he's better but it's always sold with the fitness perspective you know are you suffering from weak muscles bad Bank poor circulation you're probably not lying down get a thing where you have to do that you know get the automatic we're gonna say the one with a chair that's got the motor in the cushion that just launches your ass right honey got that old woman who takes in like 45 minutes time's up Cameron watch got up just I mean isn't that dangerous getting that short-circuit or something well good night grandma grandma grandma went to bed she she was tired she went to bed she she went through the wall she really anxious to get to bed cut out do you want my favorite advertising things that I see them do is this uh no payments until March you have you ever seen this how stupid are we supposed to be like Oh Oh March it'll never be March the guy in March he'll pay for it whoever he is I don't have any money but in March they'll be money something that guy will pay ahead of it somebody in the hospital it's always a tough visiting someone in the hospital you're walking down that Carter you don't want to get a real good look at any of those rooms as you're walking isn't it amazing how you only really care about your person when you're in them visit someone in the hospital you know you meet the person in the next bed you want them to get better but if they don't man that's a race why can't the people in the hospital where their own pajamas why do all the patients have to dress alike are they a team I don't think so pajamas and TV that's how you get over any illness this system has been working for you your entire life and then when you're in the hospital and you really want to get better you have no pajamas the TV's on the ceiling and the last night wonders I have to beat what I'll make it the only way you know that men have been at all able to even the score when this fake orgasm thing is that it was a man that invented the cubic zirconia that balances it out a little bit you can't tell we can't tell or even what would you say is the dumbest Winter Olympic event ballerina skiing yeah that's dumb I've never heard of that one ballerina skiing with snow bowling yeah that's a good one snow balling yes they actually have snow bowling with a sweep in front of it yeah it's like it's like a maid competition here we go I like the lose you know the luge the luge is uh it's that it's the one that's done on the bobsled run but if the guy it's not even on a sled it's just it's just Bob's what it is it's just it's literally Bob and he's hanging on for his life and I I feel like you could have people competing in the sport against their will and the times would be pretty much the same you just grab people you put them in the helmet so you wouldn't hear him screaming you throw them down the thing and they're in the luge who would even know the difference just you can't see them doing anything you know are they aim their feet or something it's stupid or the biathlon you know this one this is the one that combines cross-country skiing with shooting a gun how many Alpine snipers are into this it's like combining swimming and strangle a guy when we have that that makes as much sense to me you love airports feel safe in airports thanks to the high-caliber individuals we have working at x-ray security about this crack squad of savvy motivated personnel"

put on the worst shows they'll still watch it reality television give me a break there's no there's no reality in the reality television have you ever seen people hanging from rubber bands eating bull anuses in reality i don't recall ever coming across that i've watched the apprentice yeah yeah it's fine for a few minutes i can't believe nobody talks about his hair on the show isn't that the elephant in the room on that show where is your hair coming from we see that you have hair there's no question that he has it but where is it coming from and where is it going it has no visible source or end point it's just like standing too close to a train that's just going by you it's just there's hair going by i don't know where it's going but it's definitely hair well you know sometimes i watch those shows on vh1 behind the morons where they tell you the history of some pathetic music act every time the show as you're watching alright halfway through time for the band to break up

trying to determine here this is a science experiment trying to figure out if  are interested in money didn't we figure that out about 5 000 years ago i can't watch the news because the strip that runs along the bottom that never stops it drives me crazy that strip used to be you turn on the news listen to the guy the guy has the news he's the news guy he's got all the news i listen to him now the news guy comes out he starts telling you the news then the strip comes on oh no he's not the news we're the news down here this is the real news so i'm trying to listen to trying to read the ship i didn't hear the guy trying to listen to the guy i can't see what it says on this trip i cannot listen and read at the same time don't these idiots that run these network news shows understand we don't want to read that's why we're watching tv if i wanted to read i'd pick up a comic book i'm not an idiot it's always a breaking story of breaking news it's always breaking it never stops breaking the news is breaking is constant breaking they flash breaking we have it it's breaking right now breaking weight don't leave it's breaking it may have already broken they have their special correspondence they chopper them into the scene well jim there's nothing happening here yet there's no one here i have no information and i can't see a goddamn thing i don't even know if this is where i'm supposed to be back to you in the studio they cut back to the studio where they've already come up with a logo for the crisis the logo sits in the corner of the screen for the entire length of the crisis so that you can never forget that there's a crisis you can tell it is a really intense crisis because the letters in the word crisis begin to crack and break apart chunks and pieces the word crisis is in crisis from the crisis and that's when it's time to take an instant poll on the internet please go to our website and give us your ideas so we can get the opinion of people whose lives are so empty they got the tv computer internet everything all going at the same time so their hands are too busy to grab a gun and blow their brains out from the boredom  if life to you is what's on tv online on the phone and on your email i got an instant message for you open a window this place is getting kind of funky sometimes the news guy will turn his head to the side you see that little wire coming down his neck you can see that you're not supposed to but sometimes you can and it's coiled for some reason the wire like a telephone so that it can expand why does it need to expand how far is this guy's head going is he a newsman or a jack-in-the-box i'm going to sit here my head's going to go do the weather what a beautiful day in the inner harbor inside the outer harbor here in baltimore beautiful day today no argument about the weather today there's no argument even when it's nice people got to talk always nice today yeah it's really nice today do you think it's going to stay like this no i don't this is earth where have you been it's a variable temperature environment the first thing they give you when you're born is a blanket that's the situation i never want to hear another human being say to me can you believe this weather yes i can these are the same people can never leave the time either really is it three o'clock already i can't believe it's three o'clock well it is stop talking about the weather you'd know the time why don't you stand in front of the bank sign all day and every time it goes from time to temperature you can go i don't believe it i don't believe that one either and there's no five day forecast either how long have they been yanking us with this one with the little romper room raindrops and the cloud with the sun peeking out from behind oh cut the crap nobody knows what the hell the weather's gonna be there was a five-day forecast the weather report would be once every five days the only thing these weather people have figured out so far is a bunch of cover your ass weather words like partly scattered mixed with chance of and likelihood don't tell me there's a chance of rain we all know there's a chance terrorism always in the news my favorite suicide bomber is the guy who accidentally blows himself up without injuring anyone else this is wiley coyote in real life i would love to just see that moment where he goes oh oh oh no i guess eventually they'll have those big rockets and wear roller skates on their back the road curves they go straight off the cliff the suicide bomber the new dumb in the world human beings ever probing the limits of dumb beyond any dumb that has previously existed although the suicide bomber i mean the japanese did it of course in world war ii the kamikaze pilot they call them a pilot i don't know how good a pilot they really were i mean i would think if you have a fighter pilot who can shoot down enemy planes without getting shot down himself we're probably going to hold on to that guy but wing hua over here who has busted three sets of landing gear this week because he doesn't listen we got a special program for you wing yes your training is just about done right through that door and you won't need your helmet for this one one of the things it seems that we have on our side in the war against terrorists is we have a lot of films of the terrorists training in their camps i don't know where we got these films but we have quite a bit of footage on them in their camps and it seems that they are very focused in their training on the monkey bars  i don't know why they seem to believe this is all coming down to a playground at some point where this is all going to be settled what the hell do the monkey bars have to do with anything i need a volunteer to advance on the plastic horse with a giant spring underneath it kind of war is this i think we ought to focus more on the seesaw on our side because we got so many fat kids in this country who could sit down on one end of a see-saw hold those skinny terrorists up in the air on the other end that's some terrorism when you don't know whether the fat kid is going to jump off the bottom of the seesaw that'll scare the hell out of you what a great country what the way we fight wars dropping bombs and food at the same time the way we do it now bombs and food at the same time this is an american idea only we could even conceive of something like that would we even what if we drop get them some food while we're bombing them this is the way we think it's beautiful we're going to drop some bombs on you we're going to drop some food on you too it's not going to be all bombs we're going to mix it up it's going to be kind of a war-tossed salad certain things will be exploding other things will be delicious you will have to work it out they must have been on the ground or is that a jumpsuit or a grenade i don't know i can't really see it what should we do i'm going to hit the deck but i'm going to keep my mouth open just in case nice to be in the city we play all over the country all kind of big town small town it's nice to be in a city i live i live in new york and uh one of the problems that i have living in new york is what is this there's a certain thing that happens when you walk out of a building sometimes there's a person right there walking the exact same speed and direction as you when you were together there's nothing you could do about it jeff against one of these merged walks happened to me yesterday i walked out of the building suddenly i was with this old guy he was walking his schnauzer we were this bizarre gay couple that had been together for years no one could stop it waiting for this dog to take a crap so we can get back to the apartment get the banana bread out of the oven or whatever they do why do people people find themselves in situations no one knows how they got there there's always somebody in a raging river how is a person end up in a raging river who would jump into a race can't you see that it's raging there's always a dog on the banks barking even the dog knows not to jump into the raging girl what is the strategy you think of these prescription drug companies where they don't want to tell you what the medicine does or which disease it's for i want to understand how that works for them to just they come up with a good medicine it does something we're not going to tell you what we're just gonna give you the word and then we're gonna show you some people climbing on rocks that's gonna be the whole commercial i'm on the purple pill why are you on the purple pal does it make your hands sticky so you can climb on the rocks better why are the people with acid reflux and heartburn hanging out on the edge of a volcano don't they want to get away from some of these hot regurgitating liquids i love these doctors on tv that have these pads on their desk that say itching burning redness with a little check off box next to each one who would get pads like that professionally printed up walk into a printer i need itching burning redness pads this is happening a lot in my office yes who is next come in you have itching yes burning yes redness yes you've got all three congratulations thank you for helping me use my little pad good luck with your disgusting situation do you love these words that they make up for these medicines my doctor said cram it all really yes ask your doctor about cram at all well what the hell do i ask him yeah they told me to ask you about the cram at all sorry to pull you out of surgery like that seemed pretty important it was on tv now they're advertising this uh cialis the new viagra cialis on tv the guy says the announcer says if your erection lasts longer than four hours call a doctor immediately well i think i knew that i'm not calling anybody if that happens what the hell is he going to do about it he's going to go jesus christ and just hang up put the service on in case that guy calls back what the hell does he want me to do my mother takes all these prescription medicines my mother is uh lives in south florida she's a fantastic person she's old she lives in one of these minimum security prisons that they like to build down there for them to live in they i don't really understand what the security issue is in these places that the old people like why they have the guard gates and the boots and the uniforms who is stealing the old people my mother is just one of these amazing people she's uh grew up in an orphanage she's had cancer heart attacks she doesn't even count the number of things that she's had they just keep dragging her in the hospital she keeps marching back out again do what you got to do i got a bridge game today the only thing my mother fears at this point in her life that i can perceive is that the air from a vent would hit her directly oh this is trouble like you can't imagine she freaks out jerry the air is on me the air it's on me when my mother says the air is on me it's the equivalent of a normal person saying a bear is on me it is the same emergency in her mind 89 years old still driving not good i've had her car fitted with a cataract windshield the glass is about a foot thick everyone's head in the car looks huge now people think it's a car full of sports mascots coming down the street they all start pulling over we better get out of the way it must be a big game today that is good baltimore water i'll tell you that that must be from the inner harbor we're building an inner harbor it's going to be a harbor but it's going to be inside the harbor another harbor within the harbor and we're going to build a micro harbor inside the inner hall we're going to keep making the harbors smaller and smaller anyway it's good to be here so uh let's see i'm 49 years old i got married a few years ago at the age of 45 that was a little late breaking news 45 yeah 45 i admit a little late to get married clearly i had some issues but now i'm married i did it i got there i don't know how the hell i did it thank god that women are as conniving and duplicitous and manipulative as they are because we're not doing it without the woman's help we need the woman's help so because i got married so late as a result i am a little bit behind in the marriage as well i don't really know what's going on most of the time had no idea there was going to be this many questions from the wife i thought do you take this woman was going to be the last difficult question well do you yes i do am i done no you're not there are a lot more questions it's so easy for a woman to stump a man with a question well if you knew why didn't you call you asked that to any man all we see is a blank screen with a cursor flashing if i knew why didn't i call that's a tough one to me being married is like being on a game show every single day of my life i feel like i'm at the podium i got my little hand clicker thing there i'll take movies i think we saw together for 200. i'm going to take some wild guesses here the woman of course is the returning champion from last week i'll take details of a 10-minute conversation we had at three o'clock in the morning eight years ago and i'd like to bet everything i have on that alex this will be for the win the guy of course never has a clue sorry sir you did not win the sex package or the guilt-free televised sporting event thank you for playing because you don't listen and don't forget to take your garbage with you on the way out yes i was very happy to get married i was 45 i was so sick of myself hearing yourself say certain things so would you like to come up to my apartment and have some wino shut the hell up with your wand nobody wants any more wine from you just gets hard to listen i just can't listen anymore that's what it became you know he's just like he's trying to figure out what people are talking about you can't even hear anymore what is this your sister's thinking of leasing a hyundai elantra what the hell are you talking about no i don't want another drink i'll take a ritalin if you have it you know i'd really like to sleep with you but i don't think i'm gonna make it yeah i like being married didn't want to live together some couples like to live together why should we jump into a marriage why jump in to a marriage and we can just live we could live together to me to live with a woman who wants to get married that's like living with a murderer in the house you know they're in there you don't know when they're planning their next move keep waking up in the middle of the night i think i heard something downstairs what was it i don't know sounded like a caterer setting up oh go back to sleep you imagining things no i'm telling you somebody's making an ice sculpture down there we uh we have two little kids i'll tell you a little bit about them not a lot i won't tell you a lot because i know i don't want to hear anything about your kid the amusing things that they do and how you don't know where he gets it from i'll tell you where he gets it from he gets it from you because you're boring he's boring your whole damn family is boring when you are a new parent you cannot see the line of annoying conversation it is very easy to cross i will attempt to not cross it we have two little kids i have a a two-year-old which you know what a two-year-old is like it's kind of like having a blender but you don't have the top for it you can use it but there's an extensive cleanup at the end of every day we have a six-month-old boy still crying quite a bit have to give him the pacifier i don't really like to give him the pacifier but figure by the time he's dating all the breasts will be fake anyway might as well get used to it sorry kid this looks like the way it's going when you go visit a new baby you go into that little room it's the nicest little room you've ever been in in your life it's always so quiet and peaceful in there and they have the puffy cloud wallpaper there's a little lamp with a with a tiny shade and a low wattage bulb and everything is soft and clean and quiet and you look at the little babe and you think this human being's getting the most perfect start a person could possibly ever ask for in life any being could ever ask for and yet somehow 35 years later this same little sweet baby is the most annoying jerk-off jackass son of a  scumbag anyone has ever met in their entire life what happened what went wrong do you think this possible that maybe the puffy cloud wallpaper is pissing these babies off maybe what they're thinking is the first thing i ever saw in life was a lie there's no clouds on that wall the cartoons the puppets are all fake and now that i'm grown up i'm getting even with everybody maybe that's what the babies are thinking i don't know they are sweet they're cute they're lovable but let us make no mistake about why they're coming here they're coming here to replace us that's their mission their first words are mama da da bye bye next time you're around a baby look at those sweet little baby eyes you will see one thought and one thought only only a matter of time my friend all i got to do is watch this mobile and wait your tired old ass out every birthday you have is baby off in the corner going yeah happy birthday happy birthday to you mofo yeah have another piece of cake that's a good idea oh am i drooling i'm sorry i was just looking at all your stuff yeah go ahead and laugh at all my amusing baby antics we'll see who's wearing the diapers when this is all over i don't like the other kids that they bring over my house as much as i like my own kids why are they always bringing other children into my home i don't find them cute other people's kids never look quite right do they is that boy's head supposed to be like that i'm sure he's fine it just looks strange to me i can't quite understand it it's an odd bulbous quality don't you think i don't care if they hurt themselves well sure you're crying you just drove your head into the side of that tv set that was the damnedest thing i've ever seen by the way you lowered your head and ran straight into it i'd pick you up but i'm not your father and i'm glad you have a very unusual head are you trying to slam it back into normal shape you've got to be when the baby was born also this is another greatest show on earth that you cannot miss i was there my wife was there she was in that launcher that they have set up for it she was strapped in had the helmet on ready to go i was advised that i would be remaining in the northern territories during the birth i would not be entering the southern states that was fine you do what you're told in these types of situations so i'm standing there and watching the sheets like a big huge sheet it's like it's like a drive-in movie or something and watching the sheet all of a sudden the baby was born the doctor just picked her up her head just popped up above the sheet it was like a kukla friend and ollie's show so instead of focusing on the most poignant moment in human life i'm thinking this is the greatest puppet show i've ever seen and that is not the right thing to be thinking but they are fantastic little kids what else is going on i'm always waiting for someone's phone to ring when i stop i like to embarrass people people get upset when their phone rings and when it's not supposed to mean they feel so bad oh my god my phone that was my i'm sorry why should you feel that's your phone so it's a phone you have a phone how could you have a phone and then just let people call it why the outrage of it why do people talk like the person on the other end of the cell phone is trapped in a submarine on the ocean floor you're breaking up hang on what is this apollo 13 you're at the mall you're talking to somebody at the food court pretzel place that you can see from the escalator as you come down the cell phone so obsessed

comes come comes in listen i don't know how much time i have i could lose it any second tell everyone there i'm sorry it was my last call technology was supposed to make us seem more smart doesn't it

me back who was that people still telling you to wait for the beep 21st goddamn century i think we're all up to speed on the beam i think the messiah tribesmen of the african plain know about the being they don't leave a message till they hear mum  there's a certain paranoia about the phones in our world nowadays especially the phone at home the phone rings at home why it's not the same as

as big a problem with the exercise as we think i think we don't wanna stand up that's the core issue why should i get out of a chair no one wants to get out of a chair we hate to get out of the chair the chair is the most perfect place the most perfect situation the body almost seems like it was made to be seated doesn't it look at the way it bends right where you've been look at how your knees go over the front of the exact right ankle you have an ass what do you think that is it is a seat cushion growing out of your body in the exact perfect spot the ass is the first indication that we are slowly evolving into chairs we began as primitive creatures crawling on the ground then for thousands of years we crouched finally we stood fully upright came to our senses and sat right back down again all people really want out of life is to go from chair to chair to chair home chair car chair work chair movie chair restaurant chair car chair back to the home chair i'm exhausted i've been changing chairs all day i need to sit down people hate to get out of the chair the entire entertainment and sports industries is nothing more than people sitting down watching people standing up that's how impressed with it we are when you're in your chair you don't want to be disturbed would you hand me that please i don't want to have to get up come on you're up your life is already ruined don't ruin this for me the only thing that makes a human being willingly get out of a chair is to go to a bed the bed is the only thing that beats the chair nothing can beat the bed the bed is the ultimate the bet is like royalty that's why it has names like king and queen no one is getting out of bed unless you absolutely have to you ever get a call at night somebody wants to go out you're already in bed you're like are you out of your mind i'm in the bed and the people that called feel awful for having oh my god he was in bed he was in bed i called him he was in it hate to get out of the chair ever be in one of these tight movie theaters you see somebody coming down your row you get all upset about it oh look at this can you believe these people are coming in here now look what are we gonna do they get up to you always have to make that little noise as they go by why do we make that little noise i don't even know what means i think it's the word  condensed down as far as it'll go i think i'm not positive yeah the bed is the place to be even death they have a that's where you want to die in bed they have a special bed for it death bed that's where you want to die you don't want to die standing up hanging on to the drapes pulling those little rings off one by one you want to die like that you want to die in your deathbed make your subtle little deathbed hand gesture and you get a nice smooth exit out of town i've been hearing the word cremation being talked about a lot recently i don't know what this means why are americans getting interested in cremation and suddenly becoming a very popular form of burial what does it mean certainly seems like a change in how we look at our lives that we led people used to want a big thick granite stone their name carved in it with a chisel i was here god damn it and here's when i was here too get a load of that cremation's like you're trying to cover up a crime burn the body scatter the ashes around as far as anyone's concerned this whole thing never happened who are you looking for never heard of that person i don't know what you mean no nobody around here by that name i want the real funeral thing when i die everybody i know is going to be there i want to be there too right up at the front dead as a door nail laid out like a six-foot party sub that's what i want let them all sit there and have that creepy funeral feeling that makes you think all kind of crazy things when you're sitting at the funeral like what if he just got up right now what you think they would stop they would have to stop it if he sat up and of course if the person did just sit up they could flow right back in the living couldn't they because they're dressed their hair is done they're made up they look fantastic once the screaming stopped i think everybody would be fine with it but you'd never have a thought like that at a cremation would you no you walk into a cremation you go well that ashtray's full this party's over  why do you have crazy thoughts like that this is something i think about a lot why is your brain constantly supplying you with an endless stream of totally insane ideas that you really don't want even to hear you can't use them you don't want to be in the middle of a conversation with somebody and have a thought pop into your head why i could kill this guy right now i could technically do it he'd never see it coming he asked me to hand him that scissor i could take this scissor and i could just stab what the hell am i thinking that for i'd never do it i might pick up the scissor in some strange way that only i noticed here's that scissor you wanted just to give myself a little thrill but i'm that kind of person that feels bad if i think i've been rude or impolite to anyone in any situation so at the same time i hold the door open for people i also consider slamming it and crushing their skull to beds i don't know why the brain works like that why do i have suicide fantasies to go along with my homicide fantasies why is it anytime i step out onto a balcony or a terrace i always have to go right up to the edge think to myself i can blow the mind of every person at this party right now oh they would freak out oh my god he killed himself i don't believe her i was just about to stab him with the scissors kids are starting to talk about pets now not too happy about that i guess that's something you have to deal with as a parent isn't it i had a dog i love my dog i just feel like isn't the dog thing kind of over the giant bags of food the endless ball throwing haven't we had enough of this you know what i don't like about the dogs i find them manipulative this whole thing that they do where they bark at another dog what are you kidding me it's your own species what am i supposed to believe here you're freaked out by your own species you're a dog it's one of you you know they got the uh poop scoop law in new york you know you got to pick up after the dog you got that here tim i can't do that people do it they have faith in these glad sandwich bags i don't know what the hell they think that bag has made it what do we know about the glad sandwich we know it locks in freshness which is the last thing you're going to have to worry about because believe me what he's leaving for you is fresh he is making fresh daily i just don't quite get it but you got to deal with him you got to do i love it though i like the complexity of the wife and the kids and all the difficult things because i was single my brain was just it was simplified the single brain is a simple brain all i thought of when i was single is i'd like to go out with her i'd like to buy one of those and i hope these guys win that's it that's why sporting events have cheerleaders and some sort of a new car that drives out in parks in the middle guys is it they're going game girl car car girl game car girl game car girl game four hours of that and they just pass out so happy that baseball has started we were going to go to the oriole game and there's no game tomorrow we were going to go i love baseball i watch any game much i don't know what it is with the game got to get into the game see the game was the game hey there's a game i want to see the game when i get into that game i got to see that whole game too i got to see from the very beginning the very end i don't answer the phone i don't answer the door i watch every commercial i don't even blink when the game is over i need to see the highlights don't change the channel they're going to show highlights now i want to see them before i watch them again later on sportscenter so i can wake up the next morning tear the newspaper apart get to the sports section and go aha i know what i saw is what happened when i was watching it and then i'll read every story about the game that's what happened that's what happens exactly what happened what is the urge to get information we already have why is it when i'm in my car and i drive past a mirrored office building i look in the reflection to see if i'm at the wheel isn't this information i already have what would i do anyway if i looked over and it was a small korean woman driving my car hey i'd have to stop that car wouldn't i'd have to get out go up to the mirror and if it was still a small korean woman i'd have to go well i guess i stand corrected apparently i am a small korean woman who wants a manicure when i was single i was not aware that i spoke in many different tones i have since learned as a married man not only do i speak in many different tones i am often speaking in the incorrect tone i thought it was a marriage apparently it's a musical it's your tone my tone yes your tone what tone that tone what is wrong with my tone i don't like your tone what do you want me to do you better change your tone why is the male tone so much higher at the beginning of the relationship when the male initially pursues the female our voice always up here isn't it we bringing up a couple octaves you know because chinese food or italian sounds great or perhaps we could take a drive or go for a wall why do we talk like that in the beginning seems to relax the female reassure her it also makes her think that we will fit in well with the other little stuffed animals on her bed which is where we want to go but then the male tone always comes down in the relationship doesn't we get down here you hear this tone this is one of the ones they don't like but we men need our lower deeper tone because that is our business working trying to convince other men we know what the hell we're talking about you can't make any money talking like this i say we expand come on my actual speaking voice that i am using right now to communicate with you is not welcome in my house that's why i'm out here if i was to walk in my house and go all right i got to get something to eat any guy i know would say fine what do you feel like any woman will say why are you yelling at me i'm not yelling i'm just hungry you're being mean i'm starving i hate your guts feed me it's over the woman's voice also changes over the course of the relationship oh yes oh yes the women are included in this too why is it whenever there's an argument between a man and a woman and it reaches its peak emotional point the woman always finds it necessary to imitate the voice of the man and they always do it in that same way oh you always say oh no i can't do the things that you want to do oh because or because you're not you're present my friends aren't like my friends in your who the hell is this guy i have never heard anyone who speaks like this that's because you don't hear how you sound yes i do i don't sound like that nobody else does either maybe you should just shut up how has every woman on earth met the same imaginary man so i've been married for three and a half years a lot of people say to me jerry what's your secret well communication kids you know that it's all about that good dr phil communication that's what you got to do do it like dr phil shave your head and pull your chair right up close i find if uh my advice that i give to men on marriage are thinking of getting married do not let the woman get bored if you want to marry the woman that's fine you will be happy but do not let her get bored that's the key take her places leave her places do whatever you have to do because when the woman gets bored they begin to invent games to play to alleviate the boredom but they're not fun games like you and i think of as games games where there's a chance of winning it's not that kind of game women like games like the do you think this makes me look fat shell game yeah it seems like an easy game doesn't it but it's not a game it's a scam a woman will say i'm going to put on an outfit that is completely wrong for my body type and i would like to get your opinion of it don't put that on i don't want to play oh come on it's not that difficult is it do you think this makes me look fat no i don't because you're not fat so that would be impossible but if it did make me look fat would you consider lying to not hurt my feelings well i would never want to hurt your feelings then you might be lying i could look fat that's it game over you lose again  would you like to play do you think my friend is pretty roulette that's not even russian roulette there's a bullet in every chamber that game to the women you have it just a little bit easier i would say if you are in a situation where you own and operate a man men are a little simpler the only thing you really have to know about men is leave us alone that's really that all there is to it that is the only thing it says in the mail owner's manual leave me the hell alone men are a basic life form we think basic we act basic male relationship software is 1.0 and there are no upgrades  you just got to do it this way just the downloads are slow i know that's the way it is a lot of women ask what do men want from their relationships anyway i'll tell you men wants the same thing from his underwear that he wants from the woman in his life a little bit of support and a little bit of freedom that's it ladies let your man swing like a boxer but hold on to him like a brief this coffee situation is uh i don't understand the the excitement over the coffee some something happened ten years ago and everybody the whole country went berserk everybody's got to have this huge giant crazy coffee they need more coffee where's the coffee i thought they were having coffee here i need my coffee i know people that are stopping for coffee on the way to starbucks or four bucks as my friend calls it who are these i gotta keep moving folks i can't stop at each one who are the people that go into starbucks they get one of these big crazy coffees and then they open up their laptop their palm pilot their day planner a cup of coffee is not a job trying to make it look like you got a lot going on with your half calf mochachoka yaya whatever the hell it is does anyone remember the original idea of coffee was a 10 minute break in the middle of eight hours of work we are now drinking eight hours of coffee doing ten minutes of work i think we're more proud of the coffee people cross the street when they have one of these big coffees they hold it up like they've really got something don't they i believe i have the right of way here i have a very large coffee they protect it like it's their kid it's chilly out so i want you to wear this little brown cardboard sweater till we get home it's getting out of hand with the coffee my friend has a cup of coffee the second he wakes up you know this type of person that doesn't pee doesn't talk i can't talk now i have to have the coffee first we always have an argument i was saying why do you need coffee the second you wake up he says to me because when i wake up i feel groggy yeah well he just got up maybe if you give it a little time no no he says he says i need to be perked up first thing in the morning the last kind of person i want to be around is someone that is perked up first thing in the morning to me the best part of waking up is shutting the hell up i don't want to get into it with the orange juice people drop a cannon now on the side of the cart and says even more like fresh squeeze used to be more now it's even more i'm drinking i'm thinking you're so close just squeeze it already what is stopping you squeeze the goddamn oranges i don't need balls first thing in the morning that's what i'm talking about folks like from quaker roads how do you call a cereal life where do you get the balls to call a little brown cross-hatched oat square of cereal life don't you think that's maybe a touch grandiose of a title what was going on in that meeting if i was there i would have said why don't we call it odies squaries brownies oh no no no this is much bigger than that why why this is live what are you crazy what with the other names in contention how about almighty god that seems just as reasonable who wouldn't want to wake up in the morning to a nice big bowl of almighty god or new almighty god with raisins and if you don't like it you can go to hell i see the raisin bran people are still caught up in their own personal madness still convinced we are not happy yet with the number of raisins every time i go in the supermarket they got a new box with a new announcement we got more scoops now wait giant scoops millions is a trillion raises all raisins one flake come on no one cares about the raisins it's raisin bread it's okay we've all had it 99 of all raisin bran is eaten by people who have slept over somebody else's house and that's all they had no one's intentionally eating this stuff i see sun made sun made the raisin company has come out with chocolate covered raisins that they're selling in the in the movie theaters so that was a lightning bolt over there i guess 80 years in the raisin business until somebody went hey wait a minute raisin eggs that's raisins hey what we could do then there's no actual raisinet there's not a smaller raisin called a raisinet they just they just put chocolate it's just chocolate get some chocolate we could do it i love these companies watching how they try and figure their thing out like philip morris coming out with the anti-smoking campaign now have you seen this how do companies get themselves into these situations here's a company has to come out on tv and go we make cigarettes and we hate them what kind of schizo board meetings you think they're having down there well gentlemen the good news is the cigarette sales are up so we have the money to make more commercials and try and stop people from buying them the other issue on the table is are we drinking beer to keep peeing or are we peeing so we can keep drinking beer what is the thing now whenever someone gives a compliment to another person they always have to follow it with and i am not just blowing smoke up your ass have you heard people say this why do they say this has anyone had smoke in their ass that could perhaps enlighten us as what's so flattering about this that was a lovely gesture that young man made i thought was that a cuban cigar i thought was a very nice thing to do what happened to kissing ass that's the last thing i remember people used to kiss up kiss ass remember that he's a real ass kisser i guess the kissing's not getting it done anymore you better blow some smoke up there buddy eventually it'll be a complete colonoscopy you're a very fine actor and i'm not just checking you for polyps similarly whenever someone has a great quantity of a certain item you'll often hear them say well i have those coming out of my ass what yeah i got him up to wassup now obviously we don't actually have these items in our asses i think we can all agree on that but apparently we do seem to feel if it's possible i would like to mention my ass in this conversation why not it's no skin off my ass why don't you shove it up your ass as long as i've got them coming out of my ass and maybe if you got off your ass you wouldn't need to be riding my ass some people aren't sure how to include it in the conversation so they just go my ass  well i would like to congratulate you tonight on filling in another block of vacant time in your life that is something that you have done here it is not a small accomplishment it's hard to find things to do that's why i'm here i had nothing to do either i think you find as you go through life that there are quite a few gaps blank spots and dead air in it that becomes your personal responsibility to fill in people say life is too short it's actually way too long people are sitting on the decks of cruise ships doing crossword puzzles they're playing cell phone video games they're trying out that stupid water massage thing at the mall if people really just did the things they needed to do in life we could be done with it by the time we're 15. instead the way we live we like to pad it out with a lot of bogus hyped up meaningless activities projects and events that don't even work remember how stupid we all felt the day after the millennium remember the big excitement it was supposed to be it's gonna be three zeros everybody i was watching abc that go around the globe to each different time zone as it changed into the new century they were in new zealand i was going wow they're already there i wonder what it's like they must feel great no nobody felt anything they needed three zeros that's how big of nothing it was but still the human urge is irresistible to create and celebrate phony special events to convince ourselves that our lives don't suck even though the truth is our lives do pretty much suck they do everyone's life sucks your life sucks my life sucks i'm sure mine doesn't suck quite as much as yours but that is a small point here because in the vast concept of suckness of human living everyone's life sucks and that's okay never feel bad that your life sucks because the greatest lesson i think you can ever learn in life the greatest lesson that i have learned in my 49 years and if you haven't learned it i'm going to pass it on to you right now and that lesson is that sucks and great are pretty close there isn't that big of a gap between sucks and great they're right next to each other i'm always being sent off to the great new restaurant oh have you been to the new great place with the great food it's a great place we had a great time at the great place with the great food you got great so great it was great you go in these places you know what they're like with the cilantro specials and it's herb crusted and drizzled with something that's a reduction of something else why are they always drizzling it just pour it on there once in a while maybe if you didn't reduce it so much you wouldn't have to drizzle it the food comes it's like in a little tower you don't know what part to eat and what part is a structural member meal takes two and a half hours your ass is hurting by the end of it it's not half as good as any pop tart i've ever had in my whole life  no one can beat the pop tart no one the pop-tart reigns supreme in all of earth the check comes at the end of the meal in the little book like it's the story of the bill yeah here's the story once upon a time you got ripped that's the story you walk out on the street that place wasn't so great it actually kind of sucked it's true a lot of these great places suck then you go to a baseball game you have a hot dog which you know sucks you always think it's great these are great isn't this great yeah it's great but it sucks but it's gray as a result such and great are the only two ratings you even want to hear no one uses any middle ground judgment because that just makes things more complicated hey you want to go see that new movie i heard it's great really i heard it sucked it sucked i thought it was supposed to be great yeah it was it was supposed to be great suck wow i can't believe it sucked starting in like five minutes we could have walked right in it would have been great i know this sucks i say to you that sucks and greater the exact same thing how do you like that you have an ice cream cone you're walking down the street the ice cream falls off the top of the cone hits the pavement sucks what do you say great thank you very much i hope you had a good time tonight thank you so much for coming in thank you so much thank you thank you okay i was just over there i was literally standing right behind that door talk about fear of abandonment oh thank you thank you i know what you mean it really is such a nice town to visit i have to tell you we really love coming down here we've been here a couple times before it's always a pleasure i hope uh it wasn't too much rear view back there anyway as long as i'm here we seem to have all hit it off so well we i do have an extra a few minutes here sometimes uh when i feel like a nice report from uh the whole scene and uh i like to take some questions from the owner sometimes people are curious about things things any kind anything that i have done or that you would like to know about perhaps the show or i don't know if you've seen my american express uh a website thing that i'm doing now a couple of people have i'm doing a thing on americanexpress.com i made a little film with superman and in fact i talk about baltimore on the today show did you hear me talking about baltimore in the today show with superman a couple people did only the not any of the rich people i guess they don't have to get up and go to work yeah barry levinson directed the film and uh superman was talking about how he likes barry levinson because he likes the whole baltimore thing and i said you've never even been to baltimore and he says yes i have i flew over it and i we have a whole argument about flying over baltimore it's not the same as being the baltimore and it's a lot of fun anyway but anything else that you would like to know about my personal life or the dvd yes the dvd question many people are interested in the dvd of the tv series because of the fact the show was only on 19 times a day people feel that there are some gaps that need to be filled in uh actually the reason the dvd has taken so long is because they have put they put like they made a whole documentary and they interviewed virtually every person so every episode you watch if you want to watch an episode you can also watch like interviews with every the people that wrote it and the people that were in it and you know and and we make you know the cast does like a little commentary so they wanted to add a lot of extra stuff so that took a long time so the dvd will come so that you can waste your money on that yes anything else yes sir i know who i am let's get what's the question what is my favorite of all my joke favorite joke two peanuts were walking down the street one was assaulted that is my favorite joke because almost anybody can tell that it's a very easy joke to tell it's almost impossible to screw it up it's a cute joke my daughter likes that joke yes i'm sorry yes there is talk but that is all there is no there's no new show i did say something i'm i'm working on a like a a special thing but i can't really it's not going to be a tv series i understand i have been asked many times would i ever do another television series and i completely understand how from your perspective that makes all the sense in the world why shouldn't i do the silly little nonsense that i do in your living room for free while you sit there in your underwear burping scratching and making potato chip crumbs in each of the folds of your t-shirt and emitting the various cacophony of human noises that is your right and privilege in the privacy of your own sacred domain but from my perspective if i may um i am old i am rich and i am tired and i have not yet grown bored of sitting on my ass and watching my daughter rip pages out of a magazine i haven't even read yet as we enjoy the antics of elmo who's a very amusing sesame street character a very energetic very likable i watch elmo and i think let him bust his little red ass every week i did my share one more question i gotta go favorite episode i i don't know favorite episode gee i like um i like a lot of the episodes i like i like i like all there's nothing that i didn't like i i really kind of think back to moments of certain episodes that really i mean i really love when george accidentally killed his fiance with the poison envelopes i thought that was a lot of fun i like when kramer hit the golf ball into the whale's blow hole and then george found it and it was a lot of fun when i got to steal the rye bread from the old lady that was a lot of fun too so thank you again baltimore for coming we'll see you again sometime please give another round of applause to tom papa who has his own show on nbc in june you
Jerry Seinfeld,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNF_cZ6DsCo,thank you thank you very much thank you well this is it huh this is your night you're out you're making it happen new york city this is where i'm from and uh to me the most amazing thing about when you go out in this city you know you go to a show like this and you're with your friends you talk and maybe you have a good time maybe you don't the most amazing thing that happens to you on a night like this is the ride that you have in the cab you know isn't it incredible the chances that these guys take with your life and that you're so calm in the back seat you know because they got that glass partitioning you're just watching them it's like it's happening on television you know he's you know he's flying around the road and you're going boy that looked dangerous i don't think i tried that in my car that was almost an eight-car pileup did you watch what happened on that last turn then you're five minutes late you start rooting for the guy he's up on the sidewalk you're going this is a good move he killed a guy i'm on time and they always have those no smoking please no smoking he's very concerned about his health these guys doing 90 up a one way is just please please don't smell very sensitive here lungs very throat you know the dumbest thing of all you can think in a new york taxi cab is well the man knows what he's doing have you ever thought that he's a professional cab driver he's got a cab driver's license i can see it right there i don't even know what it takes to get a cab driver's license i think all you need is a face this seems to be their big qualification and a name with like eight consonants in a row have you ever checked out some of the letters in those names on the license the o with the line through it what planet is that from you need a chart of the elements just to report the guy yes officer his name was amal and then the symbol for boron so from long island parents live on long island uh 30 years something like that thank you thank you that's that's way too much applause really my folks moved to florida this past year they didn't really want to move to florida but they're in their 60s and that's the law you're not living in florida by a certain age they come and get you they force you down here they have cops leisure police they have people in golf carts with shorts and they just jump out get the golf clubs get in the back pops come on drop the snow shovel kick it over here drop it put the mittens down mom hey take it easy so i'm down there in florida unbelievable my mother's into this whole thing with walls now she's how do they get interested in walls what do you think of this wall i don't know to me if it's forcing you to use the door to get out of the room it's working you know maybe a floral pattern or something so she put up mirrors she had she decided on mirrors from the floor to the ceiling we have a huge mirror now in the living room which my mother feels gives you a feeling of space have you heard this that it makes it seem like you have an entire other room now what kind of a jerk walks up to a mirror and goes hey look there's a whole nother room in there there's a guy in there looks just like me i don't know who's falling for this i had a parakeet he used to fall for it you ever let your parakeet out of their cage they fly across the room right into the mirror with that little parakeet head there's no padding it's straight back the way they do their hair he can't take much impact he would hit that mirror bang and he would fly off in some other direction trying to get it together i always thought he's so stupid plus even if he thought the mirror was another room you would think at least try and avoid hitting the other parakeet i don't know how bright you have to be and even qualify as a parakeet i think it's a two-question test can you fly is your head smooth you're a parakeet get your wings next so so i gotta go home i gotta take a shower i'm not dirty but i need that break shower is the only break you get isn't it when you're asleep people can bother you they call you when you're in the shower they can't get to you they call up on the phone i'm sorry we can't reach him he's in the shower there's nothing anyone can do he's five feet away we can't talk to him we can't get a message we can't do anything can you come out i can't talk now i just got out i just got out of the shower i was naked singing rubbing myself all over i have to readjust to reality here now they got that shower radio there's a dynamite item there got soap in your eye you need the traffic report right then music nothing better to have in the shower no better place to dance than a slick surface next to a glass door see to me the whole idea of being in the shower is nothing matters when you're in there that's what i like about it unless of course someone flushes the toilet which matters a great deal when you're in the shower you know you touch that little handle you change the whole person's life there's nothing they can do about it they're just down the hall and you just stand there you just hear them screaming it's got a lot of control i don't like other people's showers there's always a problem with temperature adjustment there's always a little hair stuck on the wall and you want to get rid of it but you don't want to touch it i don't know how it got up that high in the first place maybe it's got a life of its own i don't want to get involved you know what i mean so you have to so you have to aim the
